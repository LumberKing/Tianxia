- MoH update event speaks of ROOT, should be FROM.
- Bloodline Siege Engineer (and others) event does not have an event target, breaking the loc. Might also not create a character properly in all cases; is the gender setup and spawn location correct? Also look at the re-scope to ROOT in the creation; that's not present in Siege Engineer, which can spawn, but is present in others, which dont't spawn.
- Short name for Seven Thousand Samurai, possibly other Tianxia mercs.
- Random nicknames (Red-cheeks, etc.) might need restrictions.
- Remove swaying restriction towards temporal rel heads.
- Check if Chinese princess trait update fails to remove the trait when the princess is unmarried and abroad.
- Check if the Hanami is too late in the year.
- Japanese council voting seems to consider the imprisonment of random people to be "high treason". The protection of the Tenno/knockoff can probably largely be removed.
- Incorrect use of "black shaman" in Desecrators recruitment; check custom_loc.
- "the messenger" for DWs can come from a random society, as opposed to the target DW society.
- EXECUTION_INTERACTION_VOTE needs loc.
- Check if "Knock them out!" option for DW desecration uses Martial or PCS; should be PCS!
- Allow the temple picked for DW desecration to be from a related religion if Chinese/Japanese enough.
- Look for Court Physician option does not show up in the "My relative is sick!" event.
- RIP.11053 has no event target and possibly no character in some cases (villager drunkard seems to be one).
- Tsuhgime does not look proper; can't be spelled out in Hiragana!
- Hanami sparring session should have its random_list hidden.
- Ancestor Worship carved idol should perhaps have different loc for Chinese/Japanese characters.
- TOG.7023 has the wrong scope for the character (ROOT instead of) in the loc.
- Yearn for lover's embrace event might have the wrong gender in the rejection response (check for "wife").
- Adultery scandal from WoL seduction should sanity check if the lover has become a concubine or spouse between when it is discovered and when the event fires.
- "Lover informs about pregnancy" and others' concubines; check if that event is wrong, seeing as there's no "let's hope it's not discovered".
- Check if "End plot" is softcoded; if so, make sure you can't target liege(s).
- Make the Council Power faction more popular in Chinese/Japanese realms.
- Consider whether childhood bully event really should give Martial; potentially inconsistent with PCS rework.
- Hanami poetry contests should perhaps not involve (young) children.
- Check tense in Hanami poetry contest loss event.
- The Viking Age event should probably not fire far, far away from Scandinavia (Japan/etc.).
- Hanami, LNY, Chuseok, Iyomante, Bear Festival events should not change traits of children as the traits awarded are not childhood traits.
- Check for possible unending Hanami/lack of cleanup of Hanami modifier. Some might fail partway through (after invites have gone out?).
- Vassal wars should perhaps be allowed in Japan in 769; the realm isn't necessarily *that* centralized.
- "You deserve a good name!" nickname event seems to pick a weird province for the "the X of Y" nicknames.
- Event 1980 might be missing a blocker for people with Conclave, but it is nice to keep it.
- Artefact inheritance for holders of viceroyalties seems to be wrong; they go to the liege.
- "my family history" -> "my family's history".
- Maybe allow wrong religion Court Chaplains for Chinese/Japanese characters, but block conversion in that case?
- HF.21117 speaks of hymns (when the target is Zealous/Cynical?), which is nonsensical for many religions.
- Spear-throwing contest from War focus might not be sensible with some cultures/etc.
- Kill revolters, revolter commanders if the defender is an AI and wins.
- Inform WotRS members on mentors dying, leaving society, becoming imprisoned/incapable, etc.
- Increase AI willingness to join PR faction against actual regency liege with quite a lot of council authority.
- Check punctuation in MoH update events.
- Courtiers marrying secluded characters should join the seclusion.
- "Pickled boar head" in seclusion event; check if there are sensible blockers!
- Again make sure that the default succession law in Japan and China is Agnatic.
- WotRS faith poem is missing the name of the faith in the loc.
- "As mu vassals" in Hanami welcome event.
- No "the Devil" nickname in Japan, China, etc.
- Generally check on AI Ag-Cog willingness; France has gone Ag-Cog pretty quickly...
- Sakahito is probably not a female Yamato name.
- ZE.12110 speaks of alms, which is nonsensical.
- DLC warning in secret faith adoption even when eligible (Shinto -> Shugendo).
- Link Japanese/Wako/Emishi/Yamato namelists properly.
- Council Power defaults in China/Japan/etc. should favour vassals.
- Prevent multiple simultaneous MoH revolts for the same kingdom in the same realm.
- Remove gender bias in succession voting for Minahasans.
- Reverse gender bias in succession voting for Minangkabau.
- Farmer girl/farrier's apprentice event seems to add Homosexual when it shouldn't (and maybe misses it when it should add it?).
- Make titles granted by the Tenno swap away from True Cognatic unless he's got Full SoW, the target has Equality, or the target has Full SoW.
- Check for possible stray pixels between c_nedong/c_taktse and c_qingyang or issue with Buddhist HWs not checking adjacency properly.
- War of Honor quest is being handed out against targets inside the same realm despite vassal wars being blocked.
- Block "Falsely confess faith" if liege doesn't care.
- Consider maybe flipping prestige reward for saying that Shirabyoshi with swords are neat if male with a male mentor that is dismissive.
- Re-localise "Summon lodge commander" power for WotRS.
- Target for "Smear rival" event chain for the WotRS is from a random society; should be WotRS.
- Random rulers in China/Japan/etc should probably not hear about Christian pilgrimage sites due to saints.
- Inform WotRS members of the death of a Hatamoto whenever there was seven of them prior to the death.
- War of Honor does not seem to be valid against independent rulers of other realms even when External Vassal Wars are allowed and you have the quest. Possibly can_use_gui issue?
- Block Secret Bears from spawning as part of the Imperial Family; it's not Amaterasu's will!
- "I no longer have the patience to negotiate" event does not have add_trait_partially_wroth_effect!
- Check if the WotRS decision to offer to take someone as a student is broken.
- Remove "Get a Mentor" quest on rank up.
- "X tried to convert me to their vile heresy" and Chinese/Japanese/Dharmic religions.
- "is widely renown" should be "is widely renowned".
- Check why "has an adult unlanded son not in the line of succession" fails for asking for land for sons; is it is_heir being weird with Gavelkind even if the son isn't actually inheriting land?
- Fellow member of WotRS caught by Court Chaplain; should not fire unless part of the same secret society!
- Check random flipping to reformed religion ahead of reformation; Korean Buddhist (?) to Reformed Muist has likely been seen (could possibly also be Chuseok conversion).
- Improve on trigger for random death events; should probably not happen as frequently for close relatives of landed characters (even if they shouldn't have complete protection...).
- Courtiers approaching lieges about conversion shouldn't be called heretics if they're not actually heretics/parents of ROOT's religion.
- Check problem with primogeniture allow when not a viceroyalty; it should be allowed if various laws are in place regardless of top liege's laws...
- Fix loc (and general firing?) of "Courtier tried to convert other courtier to heresy" event when the religion is not actually a heresy.
- Block children from pressing claims on China if eligible for CI.
- SoA.4031 claims it'll make you noreligion (Shugendo -> Shinto, Koshin -> Shugendo, Buddhist -> Hindu). Tooltip error inherited from CleanSlate?
- The Tenno (and others with a Tanistry-based law?) seems to swap to Tanistry on_startup; add a failsafe event.
- Gain title from liege ambition does not complete when being granted a title by liege.
- Dharmic Wisdom for the FotK (and the Bön MO?) should be renamed.
- Depose Tenno faction should result in vassals being able to declare war + an empowered council unless led by an Imperial Family member.
- Wives/concubines lying about their children's father should need to have Intrigue diff, not just plain Intrigue.
- Maybe block snake pit execution in China/Japan/etc.
- MoH should be harder to keep up (with middle setting) if the realm is small, particularly for e_china.
- "I will never allow her/him to turn into a savage!" loc makes no sense when the "Liege asks for Faith focus for ward" event fires with a co-religionist liege.
- Check blank "Shinto" in FotK currency gain.
- Swaying/Antagonizing shouldn't fail if you and the target are secluded in the same place.
- No child naming event for children of concubines; investigate!
- Japan's Vassal Wars law might reset on succession if heir is landed; check if this also causes the Tanistry issue, flag the heir in an on_death event, and ensure they keep the laws.
- MNM.4417 "The wisdom of [blank] is" seems to have broken loc.
- Vassals can offer to become tributaries of China (at least by the targeted Grace decision); should not be possible!
- Shenist templegfx is broken; it shows a black holding box.
---
- Small "t" in taiwanese_group loc tag.
- Secluded meditation should not prevent shutting the gates.
- Check if "Incestuous Adulterer/Adulteress" is applied properly; might be applied when it shouldn't be.
- Japanese Monastic Trait should have religious restrictions.
- You should perhaps not be able to call for your Court Physician when your landed spouse is sick.
- Non-dynastic rulers that take over pretender empires and remain CI proclaim the end of the old dynasty and the start of the old dynasty; the latter should be the new dynasty.
- Evoke Sympathy event capitalizes "Pagans", which it shouldn't.
- Ainu SRS refounded very quickly after it went public; seems odd.
- Pilgrimage to Ise sends you to Kumano; fix!
- The quest giver/rewarded for the Shinto pilgrimage shows the Tenno's portrait despite the Tenno not being the character in question or even being a member of the FotK.
- Hanami modifier (left from a Hanami that should have ended long ago) is not cleared out when a war starts; is it perhaps another modifier that's cleared out?
- The creation of a Permanent Regency should empower the liege's council; alternatively, each Regency Power law should add one level of Council Power.
- The ending of a Permanent Regency should at least partially depower the council; maybe stop short of war declaration.
- Bodyguard/Maidservant lover modifiers should be hidden for other characters; the spouse certainly shouldn't see them!
- Unreformed Jurchen and Tengri should have Defensive Attrition.
- Female Shinto Court Chaplain uses the Christian appearance; likely caused by graphical culture setup being wrong (should match religion's graphical culture), and likely present for other (female?) councillors.
- FotK "Become Japanese Monastic Feudal" is not showing up (Japanese Shinto Japanese Feudal ruler). It shows up when JMF; there's probably an incorrect NOT.
- Religion trigger in FotK "Take part in X rituals" is backwards; should be available if NOT following the relevant religion.
- NAPs appear to block factions even when they shouldn't according to game rule settings.
- TOG.7020 (ancestor worship lover) does not properly check for orientation of target character.
- Title for MNM.9800 is wrong ("The Remains of the First Pope" for the Classic of Poetry); might be individual for different artefacts?
- Characters might sometimes be ineligible to Groom an Heir for unknown reasons; not Homosexual, is married.
- Wrong pilgrim trait for Eastern pilgrim Physicians.
- RoI.180 "the province"; which province?
- Peasant Leaders should not be WotRS members; they're lowly people!
- soh.2767 fires when it shouldn't (Secretly Shugendo Koshin student + Shinto mentor).
- Failure to track down White Stag event possibly gives Arbitrary without add_trait_partially_arbitrary_effect; investigate!
- "My councubine is pregnant; great!" event and "My concubine is pregnant, but I was away?" event can fire at the same time on some occasions (child is legitimate in observed scenario).
- The WotRS "Write a poem for someone" shows the wrong event target in the follow-ups (second target picked, first or third shows up) except the final "What did they think of it?" event.
- War of Honor mission should not pick a target that's landlocked if the target is not bordering the quest receiver.
- "And here I thought I knew less" is weird.
- It is possible to show interest in DWs and SRSes before the 90 day society joining window is up.
- Mentor-student opinion is not cleared up when leaving the WotRS.
- MNM.10024 fired when stopping to show an interest in the Desecrators, with "[blank]" in the loc; odd. Based on the member list when joining a bit later, the society existed at the time.
- Characters in Japan should not write the "The Sword and Buckler Manual"; shields are frowned upon!
- "Songs of Anguish" event speaks of "Hell", which is nonsensical in many places.

- Taoist Court Chaplains are incorrectly "Upadhyayani".
- Hunting dog burial pyramids should not be eternal.
- Event 61216 option B's tooltip is weird.
- "Exalted among Men" -> "Exalted among Women" for women?

- The "Gates of Hell" event shouldn't fire everywhere... though it makes some sense in Japan since there's an Underworld there.
- Japanese (and Chinese?) Reconquest CB shouldn't be visible/available against lieges of the attacker.
- Double \n in MoH update events.
- Glitterhoof should side with the liege when voting in succession voting.
- Mittens the Kitten should want a subservient liege, because cat.
- Replace religious trading community modifier icon with something more trade-y.
- AI lieges should not ask for Heritage/Faith focus to convert someone that's "close enough" in China/Japan/etc. unless Zealous/Proud (and lacking a secret religion).
- Enlisting of Ronin should only be allowed as a primary war participant, unless it is consistent with WL event troops; also goes for Hwarang Righteous Armies.
- Event 75004 speaks of "the Church", which makes little sense for non-Christians.
- "Poachers will be eliminated!" event has some weird RootMySpymaster or some such in the loc.
- Maybe increase AI Hwarang joining a bit.
- Maybe allow slightly older characters to join the Hwarang.
- Former EoCs (and vassals?) that create a pretender when e_china changes hands do not get an MoH modifier right away.
- Check if Chinese Subjugation is properly set up; a Koreanic Buddhist is waging such a war against a Jurchen Buddhist over their capital kingdom; would be okay if it's just the kingdom thing.
- The Jomsvikings should not announce their founding in China/Japan/etc.
- WoL.11300 fired twice in very quick succession; investigate what's up with that.
- Event 4055 should not fire in China/Japan/etc.
- Koshin mentors with Shinto students claim their students are "not followers of the main religions of the WotRS" in soh.2764; actually, they are!

- Try to randomize at least one proper attraction target in soh.3314.
- The WotRS should not tell you to challenge women to duels to the death unless the women are members of the WotRS.
- Shugendo is "too foreign" in event soh.2762; it actually isn't!
- Minangkabau culture does not unlock True Cognatic; arguably, is should...
- WoL.301 refers to the county's capital if the target is a baron; it should be the target's capital.
- DW orgies should not speak of "the Great Serpent" everywhere.
- WoL.1012 fires in the wrong scope (should fire for the spouse of FROM's lover, not for FROM).
- spymaster.105 claims the plot was investigated in "All realm provinces".
- spymaster.202 can fire with no vassals (and no factions).
- DW "Attempt to Abduct" power seems to disappear if the target dies.
- "Other claim" wars might invalidate for JB vs. the Tenno; they shouldn't, but they should only be valid if the target isn't Yamashiro.
- "Become Japanese Bureaucracy" is a poor name for the decision; re-localise it!
- Tengri reformed with the Yi Doctrine; it is missing its "Only yi_pagan_reformed need apply!" condition!
- Missing comma after child's name in RIP.29601.
- The Seven Thousand Samurai have 8k troops; they should have 7k.
- Being appointed to the council during seclusion should not take you out of seclusion; councillors normally get to seclude themselves!
- Add strict realm size limits for increasing (as opposed to keeping) your MoH level to certain levels; 108 realm size Chinas controlling maybe a quarter of de jure China should not have an Unquestioned rating!
- Block Decadence revolts against anyone defending against a GHW (check both the crusade and the new_crusade CBs); title destruction could cause weird things, as could people going independent because of it.
- Shinto pilgrimage to the Chrysanthemum Throne has broken loc in the arrival event.
- The event picture for random Chinese/Japanese conversion should be changed when the county converts to your public religion; that is a positive event, so the burning house is weird.
- "Become Immortal" ambition should probably cancel on conversion away from Taoist.
- MNM.4441 "lack of women around here" with a male character falling in love with a woman.
- It appears to be impossible to faction for secondary titles (count vassal vs. duke liege, secondary duchy, both Japanese Feudal).
- The Breton Company seems to be within the diplo range of Kai; it really shouldn't be!
- Japanese government change decisions should list what the governments' inherent features are in the tooltip.
- Japanese government switching should perhaps be limited to once per ruler.
- Nomadic succession works very poorly with secular rel heads; it doesn't force a co-religionist successor, so the rel head title will easily get destroyed.
- The Rus Company seems to be within the diplo range of Kai.
- The Turkic Band seems to be within the diplo range of Kai.
- "Ask Liege for Title" should probably not be an option while liege is defending in a war.
- Event 100203 lacks a quotation mark at the start.
- The FotK decision to become JMF can be taken while already JMF; shouldn't be possible!
- Middle East Black Death event speaks of the Buddha (Shinto character).
- Event 30051 should not fire for secluded characters, *especially* not when the Black Death has come to town!
- Hurt the MoH significantly more if the Black Death is in many held provinces!
- Mainland SEAsia plague event fired twice for the same Black Death epidemic; one should perhaps have been Maritime, judging by the plague map.
---
- WoL adultery fallout events might not fire or might be broken in various ways.
- Courtier version of farrier/carpenter event has inverted handout of Homosexual.
- Decrease Shotoku's power a bit; she should be in a good spot, but probably not fully depowered as that makes her shut down warfare very quickly.
- Event RIP.4046 fired and said that "my liege" would be upset while talking about a concubine. Probably a scoping error.
- The "Await the Messenger" event for DWs speaks of "the True Lord"; might not work for everyone.
- MNM.20021 talks of the "Tears of Demeter", which is nonsensical in China/Japan/etc.
- The "Bodyguard lover" event talks about making him a squire, which is nonsensical in many places.
- "Wife poisons son" event fires even for wives that shouldn't care (Content) against sons that aren't ahead of theirs in the line of succession.
- The lower success chance fabrication plot decision should not be available when the higher success chance one is available; it's just stupid to use the worse one!
- EXILE_IMPRISONED_INTERACTION_VOTE needs loc.
- "My brother and sister in darkness" (start of DW orgy); should only be one of the two.
- No missions seem to be given to DW leader.
- "Liege buys new surgical tools" and its follow-up shows a concubine rather than the liege; is it actually properly involving the liege?
- Check conditions for expelling the Jews; they have apparently been expelled in Sulawesi, where they are unlikely to have had a presence...
- Divine Ancestry rel head titles can be inherited by non-Divine Ancestry heirs of the correct religion; destroy it on_death if that would be the case.
- Event 100231's loc gets weird when pluralized for Japanese titles. Maybe make it singular?
- DW Grand Ritual blessings should perhaps have different loc for non-Satanists.
- Non-stupid relatives should not ask for de facto impossible wars in event 66110.
- Imprisoned women should not go "I would make a great council member despite that being against tradition; hire me!".
- opinion_of_<trait> loc seems to lack a space before the "(".
- The DW event about killing a peasant family should target a demesne province, not your location.
- Better trait setup for (re)founding Imperial Guard regiments.
- Wars to Maintain the Permanent Regency should probably not end inconclusively on the death of the PR.
- Wars to End the Permanent Regency should probably not end inconclusively on the death of the PR.
- Wars FOR the Permanent Regency seem to end inconclusively for no good reason.
- It should not be possible to start composing a book from a dungeon cell.
- If a war to end the Permanent Regency ends inconclusively outside of the attacker's death, the person with the Permanent Regent should get the prestige refunded.
- Check AI logic for PR power laws; they do not seem to be changing...
- Imprisoned lieges should not be asked to give their courtiers nicknames.
- Marshals (and other councillors) should not approach imprisoned lieges about nifty ideas.
- Demon hunters should not go after imprisoned DWs; they're incapable of doing suspect things like those described in the event chain!
- The option to kill a child to kill demon hunters has several "Relative dies" random options; weird.
- Change king-tier Nepali titles; they're confusing!
- "the landscape around <capital>, particularly around <capital>" in HF.21117 is weird (counts only?).
- "Cursed infidels!" in the "Crusade ended in victory" event makes little sense when the defender is completely unrelated.
- Glitterhoof armour event uses ROOT's name where it should use the horse's name.
- "Lover suggests you should sleep together" refrences ROOT rather than ROOT's spouse when it comes to who might discover it.
- Swaying events work on prisoners if you elect to not stop; they should not be able to be involved in such things!
- You can apparently get the "SR society member leaves holy book for you" event with your own religion; is something broken?
- SR communities remain utter nonsense; about 90 % of Japan's provinces flipped religion *all at once* thanks to them!
- Lower Shinto Intrigue boost to +2.
- Make the "We've discovered one of the Six!" event fire faster.
- Atlanteans are used for random, which they shouldn't be!
- Check ai_flag_refuse_conversion and religious conversion.
- MNM.3410 should have an explicit blocker for Zealous.
- Tangut culture should use the relevant gfx.
- Ningdu unit position might be weird.
- Mourning might end early due to an "ongoing conflict" when not at war; incorrect trigger in both "Do you have a valid reason to not mourn?" and the desc for the follow-up?
- Hide more CBs; evaluate can_use vs. can_use_gui.
- "Mourn unmourned ancestors" should be high priority.
