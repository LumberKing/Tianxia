EVTDESC_SOH_5401;Today I was approached by a servant sent by [FromFrom.GetBestName], who asked me to pledge to support [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s bid to become the Grand Chancellor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5401;That sounds reasonable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5401;You will have to pay me first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5401;If [FromFrom.GetSheHe] will owe me a Favor, I'll do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_5401;If we consider it repayment of the Favor I owe, I'll do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_5401;How about we forget all about this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_5401;I'd rather resign from the council!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5402;The servant I sent to request support from [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that [From.GetSheHe] is prepared to support my bid to become the Grand Chancellor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5402;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5403;The servant I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that [From.GetSheHe] will only support my bid to become the Grand Chancellor if I pay [From.GetHerHim] a substantial amount of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5403;I suppose that's reasonable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5403;[From.GetSheHeCap] asks too much!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5404;I did not have to wait long for [From.GetBestName]'s servant to return, bringing with him the gold I asked for in return for my support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5404;Tell [From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetSheHe] will have my support!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5405;[From.GetBestName]'s servant returned before long with word that [From.GetBestName] is unwilling to pay me for my support and that it is too bad that we could not reach an agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5405;Did [From.GetSheHe] expect me to ask for less?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5406;My servant has returned with word that [From.GetBestName] is prepared to support my bid to become the Grand Chancellor if I am willing to consider it a Favor to be repaid when [From.GetSheHe] asks for something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5406;I suppose that's fair...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5406;I would rather not owe [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5407;[From.GetBestName]'s servant quickly returned with word that my request for a Favor in return for supporting [From.GetBestName]'s bid to become the Grand Chancellor was deemed acceptable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5407;This will surely be beneficial!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5408;It did not take long for [From.GetBestName]'s servant to return with word that [From.GetBestName] is unwilling to agree to owe me a Favor in exchange for me supporting [From.GetHerHim]'s bid to become the Grand Chancellor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5408;Well, I suppose that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5409;The servant I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that [From.GetSheHe] is willing to support my bid to become the Grand Chancellor if I am willing to consider it repayment of the Favor [From.GetSheHe] owes me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5409;That sounds reasonable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5409;I can think of better uses for that Favor...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5410;[From.GetBestName] did apparently not need to think for very long before reaching a decision as [From.GetHerHis] servant returned almost immediately with word that [From.GetBestName] is willing to consider my backing repayment of the Favor I owed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5410;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5411;It seems [From.GetBestName] might have other plans for the Favor I owe [From.GetHerHim] as [From.GetHerHis] servant returned with word that [From.GetSheHe] is unwilling to consider my support to be repayment of that Favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5411;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5412;The servant I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that [From.GetSheHe] deflected the request I made, and made some vague comments that makes it seem like it would be best for me to drop the matter for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5412;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5413;To my surprise, I have learned that [From.GetBestName] has resigned from the council. It seems [From.GetSheHe] did it to make a statement about [From.GetHerHis] unwillingness to support my bid to become the Grand Chancellor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5413;Maybe [From.GetHerHis] replacement will support me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5414;I have finally managed to ensure sufficient backing that [Root.Liege.GetBestName], the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, no longer can refuse to name me Grand Chancellor or to grant me and the rest of the council more authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5414;An auspicious day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5415;It has become clear that [From.GetBestName] has the support of a large number of my councillors, and it is impossible for me to avoid naming [From.GetHerHim] Grand Chancellor and to give [From.GetHerHim] and the rest of the council more authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5415;This is not ideal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5416;With my backing and the backing of several other councillors, [From.GetBestName]'s appointment as Grand Chancellor is now a fact, and [From.Liege.GetBestName], the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has given the council greater authority too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5416;I'm sure this bodes well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5417;[From.GetBestName] has managed to get enough support to be named Grand Chancellor, and [From.Liege.GetBestName], the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has also given the council greater authority. Though the latter might be good for me, the former could be a problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5417;I need to be careful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5418;It seems [From.GetBestName] has managed to convice [From.Liege.GetBestName], the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, to name [From.GetHerHim] Grand Chancellor and to give the council greater authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5418;Curious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5419;Having led the armies that put the new [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven on the throne to victory I am in position to become Grand Chancellor, and can also ensure greater authority for the council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5419;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5420;[From.GetBestName] was instrumental in ensuring that I gained the throne, and it is clear that the only reasonable reward for such a great service to me and the realm is to name [From.GetHerHim] Grand Chancellor and to give the council more authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5420;I suppose that's reasonable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5421;[From.GetBestName]'s efforts to put [From.Liege.GetBestName], the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, on the throne have earned [From.GetHerHim] the position of Grand Chancellor and has also ensured greater authority for the council as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5421;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5422;[From.GetBestName]'s efforts to put [From.Liege.GetBestName], the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, on the throne have earned [From.GetHerHim] the position of Grand Chancellor and has also ensured greater authority for the council as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5422;I suppose that could be a good thing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5423;[From.GetBestName]'s efforts to put [From.Liege.GetBestName], the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, on the throne have earned [From.GetHerHim] the position of Grand Chancellor and has also ensured greater authority for the council as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5423;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5424;[FromFrom.GetBestName] has sent a messenger with a request that I agree to give [FromFrom.GetHerHim] my spot on the council, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] would serve the realm better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5424;I suppose I can agree to that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5424;I'll need some money in return!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5424;If you'd agree to consider it a Favor, I'll do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_5424;Only if we consider it a Favor repaid...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_5424;I think I'll deflect the request...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_5424;I'd rather resign and hope someone else gets my old job!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5425;[From.GetBestName] has agreed to give me [From.GetHerHis] spot on the council, which surely will benefit both me and the realm as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5425;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5426;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] is willing to give me [From.GetHerHis] spot on the council if I pay [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5426;A reasonable request!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5426;I'd rather save the money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5427;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] has agreed to my request for money in exchange for my spot on the council, and the money has also been delivered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5427;The job is yours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5428;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] is unwilling to pay me in exchange for my spot on the council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5428;I guess I am keeping the job, then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5429;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] is willing to give me [From.GetHerHis] spot on the council if I am willing to grant a Favor in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5429;A reasonable request!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5429;I'd rather not owe [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5430;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] has agreed to my request for a future Favor in exchange for my spot on the council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5430;The job is yours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5431;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] is unwilling to owe me a Favor in exchange for my spot on the council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5431;I guess I am keeping the job, then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5432;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] is willing to give me [From.GetHerHis] spot on the council if I am willing to consider it a repayment of the Favor I am owed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5432;A reasonable request!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5432;I'd rather keep the Favor...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5433;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] has agreed to consider my spot on the council a suitable repayment of the Favor I owed [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5433;The job is yours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5434;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in considering my spot on the council a suitable repayment of the Favor I owe [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5434;I guess I am keeping the job, then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5435;[From.GetBestName] has managed to deflect the request I made for [From.GetHerHis] spot on the council, and it is unwise to press the issue at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5435;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5436;It seems [From.GetBestName] thinks that resigning from the council and letting our liege find a replacement is a better idea than giving [From.GetHerHis] spot to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5436;Perhaps I will still be picked?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5437;[FromFrom.GetBestName], the Grand Chancellor, has requested that I switch to [FromFrom.GetHerHis] voting pattern, indicating that I might find it in my best interests to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5437;I suppose I can agree to that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5437;I'll bribe [FromFrom.GetHerHim] instead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5437;I'll tell [FromFrom.GetHerHim] [FromFrom.GetSheHe] no longer owes me a Favor instead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_5437;I'll accept a loss of face instead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_5437;I'd rather resign!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5438;[From.GetBestName] agreed to my demand that [From.GetSheHe] should switch to my current voting pattern for the foreseeable future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5438;Just as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5439;Instead of switching to my current voting pattern [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to send me some money, doing it in such a fashion that I cannot refuse to accept it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5439;I can live with that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5440;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] will not switch to my current voting pattern, but that [From.GetSheHe] will instead cancel the Favor I owe [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5440;I suppose that's agreeable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5441;Instead of agreeing to switch to my current voting pattern [From.GetBestName] has chosen defiance, even though the request was worded in such a fashion that doing so means a loss of face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5441;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5442;It seems [From.GetBestName] would rather resign from the council than switch to my current voting pattern, as [From.GetSheHe] has informed our liege of [From.GetHerHis] immediate resignation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5442;That's unexpected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5444_A;A skilled strategist, [new_strategist.GetBestName], has heard of my great deeds and has offered me [new_strategist.GetHerHis] service, if I have a use of [new_strategist.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5444_B;[new_strategist.GetBestName], a skilled strategist familiar with my family history, has offered [new_strategist.GetHerHis] service, if I have a use of [new_strategist.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5444;[new_strategist.GetSheHeCap] will serve me well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_5446;[new_administrator.GetSheHeCap] will serve me well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
