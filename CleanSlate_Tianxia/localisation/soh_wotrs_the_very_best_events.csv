EVTDESC_SOH_2903;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nThe approximate location of one of the greatest warriors in the world -- the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] -- has been determined. You must seek out this champion and defeat them in an honorable duel.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[rising_sun_leader.GetSocietyRank] [rising_sun_leader.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2903;I'll depart at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2905;As I am passing through a village on my way to where the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] supposedly can be found one of the villagers is behaving very rudely towards me, doing his best to get in the way of my horse and making several unflattering comments about me and my chosen attire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2905;Such insolence must be punished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2905;I'll just ride off...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2906;I pull out my sword and cut the offensive man down with a single swift strike, as is my right as a warrior. Unfortunately, the other villagers appear to be horrified by my behaviour, and they demand that I leave the village at once as they do not want any further trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2906;I suppose I should leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2907;I draw your sword and cut the offensive man down with a single swift strike, as is my right as a warrior. The villagers nearby cry out in dismay, and soon a large number of guards surround me. After hearing what happened they demand that I pay a fine, as their customs apparently do not allow warriors to cut down rude commoners at will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2907;I'll pay your fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2907;I'll kill you all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2907;Time to run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2908;The guards that had surrounded me did evidently not anticipate that I would consider fighting them as they are completely surprised by my attack. By the time that the survivours start to recover I have already cut half of them down, and the other half does not put up significant resistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2908;Was that all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2909;I attack the guards surrounding me, catching many of them by surprise, and the battle is already in my favor by the time the less surprised ones can intervene. It takes me a while to finish the fight, but even though they injure me it is hardly in a concerning fashion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2909;'Tis but a scratch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2910;The guards are not particularly surprised by me electing to attack them, and they put up fierce resistance. The battle eventually turns in my favor, but though I come out alive it probably was a bad idea to fight the guards as they manage to injure me quite severely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2910;That hurt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2911;The guards are ready for my attack, and I am wounded almost as quickly as I move to attack them. Though I do my best to avoid their blows and try my best to strike back at them, the battle does not go my way, and soon I find myself lying on the ground, bleeding out from a large number of lethal wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2911;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2912;One evening when I am passing through a forest I hear the sound of people talking somewhere nearby. I cannot make out what they are saying, and as far as I can tell they are not in my immediate vicinity, but I am evidently not alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2912;I must investigate this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2912;I must investigate this... discreetly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2912;It is safest to leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2913;As I move around a large boulder I find the source of the voices I have been hearing. It seems a number of attractive young [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] are taking a bath together in a small pool in the forest and have been talking rather loudly while doing so. They have noticed my approach, and seem a bit surprised by my presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2913;Sorry to have bothered you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2913;May I join you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2914;I make my way towards the voices, moving carefully. As I crest a small hill I can see that a number of attractive young [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] are taking a bath together in a small pool in the forest, talking loudly while doing so. They do not appear to have noticed my presence yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2914;I'll not bother them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2914;I will ask to join them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2915;I make my way towards the voices, moving carefully, but I am not as careful as I would have liked. I trip over a branch and fall through a thick bush, emerging face-to-face with a number of attractive young [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] that are taking a bath together, talking loudly to one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2915;Sorry, I took a wrong turn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2915;May I join you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2916;I abandon stealth and move towards the bathing [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] openly, deciding that they likely will be more willing to hear me out if I let them see me coming. They appear to be surprised by my presence, but they do not indicate that my presence is unwelcome as I approach them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2916;May I join you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2917;The [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] taking a bath in the forest interrupt me before I am done trying to invite myself to join them, telling me that it would be best for everyone if I turned around and kept walking. Though it was not what I wanted to hear, it is clearly not worth pressing the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2917;Fine! Be that way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2918;The attractive young [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] quickly invite me to join them in the small pool they are bathing in, and I waste no time getting out of my clothes and joining them. We all seem to have a good time bathing, and I start to wonder if it perhaps would be worth trying to take things further...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2918;I'll not push my luck...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2918;It's worth a shot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2919;All of the attractive young [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] are open to the idea of doing something rather more intimate than just bathing together, and we waste no time before getting started. The evening turns out in a most wonderful fashion for everyone involved, and I do not regret asking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2919;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2920;All but one of the attractive young [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] sharing a bath with me find my suggestion outrageous and quickly make excuses to leave. One of them lingers behind, however, and before long the two of us are engaged in activities far more intimate than just sharing a bath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2920;I suppose that was a success...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2921;The attractive young [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] I am sharing a bath with are not happy with my suggestion that the six of us should do something more intimate, and they hurriedly make excuses to leave and disappear before I can try to convince them that they should stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2921;I should not have bothered...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2922;One day on the road I come across a preacher attempting to spread the word of the [preacher_province.Religion.GetName] faith to all who would listen. I am of course an adherent of the [Root.TrueReligion.GetName] faith, but perhaps there would not be any harm in listening to what the preacher is saying?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2922;I'll listen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2922;The [Root.TrueReligion.GetName] is the only true faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2923;There have been times during my journey to the location of the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] when I have misjudged how much food I would need to carry with me to have something to eat between villages. Though this at times has been unpleasant, I have come to realize that I actually do not need quite as much food as I previously would have thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2923;I could stand to eat less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2924;The roads I have been travelling on have at times been rather poor, and even when they have been good I have sometimes been journeying up steep hills or otherwise had a harder time than normal. Though there have been times when I have considered taking a less difficult path, my choice to not always do that has resulted in my endurance improving quite a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2924;I feel stronger now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2925;One day on the road a group of armed men and women suddenly appear and surround me. They are dressed in mismatched outfits of fairly low quality, so I am fairly convinced that they are bandits even before they demand that I hand over all of my valuables if I value my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2925;You'll die for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2925;How about just some of my money?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2925;Time to flee!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2926;The bandits that have surrounded me were clearly not prepared for an opponent as skilled as me, as they are taken completely by surprise when I attack them. Several of them fall before they can react, and though the rest of them attempt to fight back they are not even able to as much as wound me before they all fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2926;They stood no chance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2927;I manage to catch a few of the bandits by surprise and kill them quickly, but the others do not go down quite as easily. Though they are not particularly skilled at fighting there are quite a few of them, and even though I prevail they manage to wound me during the fighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2927;I suppose that went well enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2928;I do not really surprise the bandits by trying to fight them, and they manage to fight back quite well. It takes me more time than it probably should to come out on top, and though I eventually drive the last of the bandits I have taken a rather vicious wound in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2928;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2929;The bandits are prepared for my attack, and I am wounded before I even have raised my weapon. Though I do my best to make them reconsider what they are doing and manage to wound a few of them the battle does not go my way, and before long I take a fatal wound, then another, and another...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2929;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2930;Though some of the bandits definitely appear to be of the opinion that they should take all of my valuables even if that means that they would have to fight me their leader is open to the suggestion that I willingly part with a comparably small sum of gold in exchange for them leaving me in peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2930;That was probably the right move...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2931;The bandits laugh at the suggestion that they should be satisfied with a smaller amount of money that I would willingly part with in exchange for them leaving me alone. Only two options remain open to me now, and I need to make a decision before it is made for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2931;Time to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2931;Time to flee!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2932;Though I would have assumed that the bandits would have been prepared for the possibility that I would attempt to flee instead of fighting them they are taken completely by surprise, and I have put quite some distance behind them and me by the time that they react. They give chase for a while, but I eventually manage to lose them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2932;Phew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2933;The bandits fail to prevent me from fleeing, though they give chase easily enough, and some of them have ranged weapons. Though I eventually get far enough away from them that they are forced to abandon the pursuit I have still been injured. The wounds are fairly minor, but might still result in noticeable scars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2933;I suppose it could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2934;I have passed through many villages on my way to fight the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] can be found, and the locals have often taken an intrerest in me. Today that interest was in the form of several young children that noticed my weapons and asked if I would be willing to give them a few lessons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2934;Sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2934;Sorry, but no...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2934;Oh, I will teach you a "lesson"...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2935;The peasant children I agreed to give a quick lesson quickly picked up the basics that I initially had planned to teach them, and realizing that they might be ready to learn more I move on to more difficult things, which they also seem to get the hang of. Evidently they will be far more skilled warriors than I had thought possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2935;They had a good teacher!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2936;The peasant children seem to have played with wooden swords in the past, as they are not completely hopeless, but it still takes me quite some time to teach them what I would consider the essential basics that a warrior should know. They have improved a bit by the time I need to leave, but they are not particularly skilled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2936;I am not surprised;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2937;I had not expected the peasant children I agreed to teach to be particularly good, but I would at least have expected them to understand how to hold one of the wooden practice swords I instruct them to make. I do my best to teach them some of the basics, but I am unsure if they even managed to understand those.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2937;Why did I even bother?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2938;The peasant children are eager to be taught a lesson by my and are caught completely by surprise when I disarm them one by one and give them a thrashing. A couple of them attempt to fight back, but I disarm them again, and soon they are all running away, bruised, crying, and taught not to mess with their betters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2938;That concludes today's lesson!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2939;As I am passing through yet another village on my journey I notice that there is a local festival of some kind going on. I investigate it and learn that they will be holding an archery contest, and several of the villagers seem eager to compete against a foreigner as they offer to let me compete almost as soon as they spot me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2939;I'll compete!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2939;I'll not bother with this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2940;As the first round of the archery competition gets underway it becomes apparent that the villagers have a wide range of skills. Some of them are unable to shoot well enough to be able to hit anything close to their target, while others strike true time and time again. My own skills are good enough that I am not yet disqualified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2940;Time for the next round;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2941;The second round of the archery competition involves shooting at targets further away than those during the first round, and most of the villagers are not skilled enough to manage this. By the time that the round is over it is just me and one other archer that are left, and I expect the final round to be quite challenging.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2941;Time for the true test!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2942;The final round of the archery contest takes a long time to conclude, as I and my opponent seem quite close in skill. Eventually I come out ahead as my opponent misses the centre of her target ever so slightly. She does not seem particularly upset, however, and gives me a quick curtsey, proclaiming that I have bested her fairly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2942;Well fought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2943;Though I do my best my skills are not up to the task, and I end up losing the archery competition. The winner, a young woman that apparently has won quite a few contests in the past, is more skilled than nearly every archer I have seen before as far as I can tell, so I suppose it is not too shameful to have lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2943;Time for me to leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2944;As I keep travelling through foreign lands I sometimes find it difficult to find the kind of food that I would be used to. There is often plenty of foreign cuisine to try, however, and it might perhaps be worth trying it out when I have the opportunity instead of insisting on something familiar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2944;I'll try some new things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2944;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2945;I take the next opportunity to try some new kinds of food and quickly realize that it is quite good. I ask someone to bring me more of it, and by the time the meal is over I have eaten quite a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2945;That was a nice meal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2946;I try some new kinds of food when the opportunity arises and find that it tastes rather strange. Initially I think that it probably is due to a lack of familiarity with it, but as I force myself to keep eating I start feeling more and more nauseous, and I end up having to fight to keep what I have eaten down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2946;This was a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2947;One morning when I am riding through yet another village on my way to where I hope to face off against the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] a young man with a sword challenges me to a duel upon noticing my sword. Judging by how he is standing, he is not a very good warrior, so it should be trivial to defeat him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2947;Challenge accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2947;I don't think I'll bother...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2948;As I had predicted my opponent is quite bad, and I easily evade his strikes while testing his defenses. It is a simple enough matter to disarm him once I notice a few flaws in his fighting style, and now that I have beaten my opponent I get to decide what to do with him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2948;I suppose I can compliment him...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2948;I'll salute him and leave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2948;I should mock him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_2948;He deserves no mercy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2949;One day on the road my horse loses one of its shoes, and though it is easy enough for me to get it to the nearest village it turns out the local farrier and his apprentices are sick at the moment, forcing me to remain there for several days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2949;An unfortunate delay...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2950;Though I am confident that I and the rest of the Warriors of the Rising Sun are the greatest warriors in the world and that our way of warfare is quite good it is still useful to consider how a potential enemy might think, and I feel that I have learned some useful things through discreet inquiries during my journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2950;Knowledge is power...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2951;I enter yet another small village on the road towards the location of the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] and find that the villagers do not seem to be getting along very well at the moment. Inquiring about the situation I learn that two prominent families have dragged nearly everyone into an ongoing feud of theirs. The villagers suggest that I could help settle the dispute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2951;I can certainly try!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2951;I don't want any part of this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2952;I meet with representatives from the first family shortly after agreeing to serve as an impartial judge, and they tell me about a number of terrible things that the other family has done. Some things sound rather outlandish, and at times the story is a bit jumbled, making it hard to say what actually might have happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2952;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2952;I suspect I am being lied to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2953;The second family's account of what happened does not match what the first family told me at all. The only real similarities between the two stories is that neither of them seem wholly coherent and that both of them definitely claim that their side is in the right and that the other side is lying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2953;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2953;I suspect I am being lied to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2954;Knowing that I have heard what both sides have to say the villagers are eager to hear my verdict. So far it is not entirely clear to me whether either family's story is the truth, though perhaps it is possible to reach a decision even so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2954;I need more time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2954;The first family is lying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2954;The second family is lying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_2954;Both of them are lying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2955;Though I caught both sides lying to me it still seems prudent to call out the first family alone as I feel that their lies were a bit more substantial. The second family is quick to thank me, and as I would rather not stay around to see what might happen I decide that it is time to leave the village.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2955;I did the right thing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2956;With the second family's story being a rather obvious lie I decide to rule against them. The first family and their supporters are quite pleased, and though I feel that it would be prudent to leave the village quickly I am still confident that I have made a fairly good judgment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2956;It was the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2957;The crowd that is listening to my verdict immediately erups in shouts when I reveal that both families lied to me, and it is not long before the first punch is thrown. Before long the whole village is in chaos, and I decide to leave before someone tries to attack me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2957;They deserve each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2958;I meet with representatives from the first family again to discuss some things that I thought were unclear about their story. To my surprise they admit that perhaps they might have been a bit untruthful and suggest that perhaps some coin would make me ignore this fact and would make me rule against the other family...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2958;I accept your payment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2958;I will not be bribed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2958;I will reveal this dishonesty at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2959;I gather the villagers and declare that I have a verdict to make. The family I just spoke to seems happy at first, but as I publicly reveal that they just attempted to bribe me and that that makes it clear that they are not in the right their grins fade. I decide to leave the village right away to avoid potential retribution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2959;It was the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2960;After being offered a bribe by the first family I am not terribly surprised when the second family also offers a bribe to side with them when I start questioning them about some flaws in their story. It would certainly not be honorable to accept a bribe, but perhaps nobody would find out...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2960;I accept your payment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2960;I will not be bribed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2960;I will reveal this dishonesty at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2961;I gather the villagers after speaking to the second family and declare that I have reached a conclusion due to the fact that bribery was attempted. I can see that both sides look a bit worried, but when I call out the side O just spoke to the other side's mood brightens, and they cheer for me as I take my leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2961;It was the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2962;With both sides having told me stories that do not make sense and having attempted to bribe me it is clear that I will not learn the actual truth, and it is time to make my verdict as the villagers are starting to become impatient and I also need to be on my way soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2962;Side against the first family;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2962;Side against the second family;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2962;Expose both as being dishonorable;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2963;As the bribe the first family offered was larger than the bribe offered by the second family I decide that they are the least honorable family, and I quickly rule against them. Though there are those that would say that I should have ruled against both sides I feel that potentially ending the feud was more important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2963;It was the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2964;The first family is quite displeased to learn that I will not rule in their favor despite the fact that I accepted their bribe, and some of them call me out on this. The second family seems a bit surprised by what just happened as I did not accept their bribe, but they are certainly happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2964;Money can't buy justice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2965;Having accepted a bribe from the second family I declare them to be in the right. The first family is definitely not happy, and I would have earned more money if I had sided with them, but it would perhaps have been more dishonorable to have done so or to have gone back on my agreement with the second family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2965;It was somewhat honorable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2966;Both families are confident that I will rule in their favor when I gather the villagers together once more, seeing as they know that their side has bribed me. The first family's smiles disappear quickly when I declare that they are in the wrong, and some of them go as far as to call me a deal-breaker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2966;Someone had to lose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2967;Though both sides attempted to bribe me and could have been ruled against based on that alone Iu feel that there were more holes in the story the second family told me, and I rule against them based on that. The first family cheers me on as I depart the village, clearly satisfied with my judgment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2967;It was the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2968;As I accepted a bribe from the second family they seem confident that I will declare them in the right, but I quickly make them lose their smiles as I rule against them. The first family seems surprised about what just happened, seeing as I did not accept their bribe, but they are definitely happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2968;Money can't buy justice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2969;Since I accepted a bribe from the first family and turned down the bribe of the second family I feel that I am bound to rule in favor of the first family. It is perhaps not as impartial a judgment as people would have expected, but I did make a deal, and it would be dishonorable to alter it....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2969;It was somewhat honorable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2970;I accepted a bribe from both families, but with the first family paying me more I feel that it is right to take their side. The second family is most unhappy with this development, and several of them accuse me of being a deal-breaker as I prepare to leave the village, which is unsurprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2970;Someone had to lose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2971;Both of the families seeking a verdict from me told inconsistent stories, and both of them attempted to bribe me. The honorable course of action is abundantly clear, and I tell the assembled villagers that both sides are in the wrong. They do not take it well, and start fighting each other even before I can take my leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2971;You deserve each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2972;Having accepted a bribe it would perhaps be reasonable to honor my agreement with the familiy in question, but I decide that it is more honorable to expose both families as being dishonest. The villagers quickly start shouting at each other, and it is not long before someone throws the first punch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2972;I should get going...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2973;Both families have paid me to rule against the other, and both clearly expect to be declared in the right. However, I decide that the most honorable cours of action would be to honor both agreements, and thus I rule against both families. A brawl breaks out as I am leaving the village to continue on my journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2973;Both got what they paid for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2974;One day on the road I come across a man dressed in clothes that probably were the height of fashion once but that now look rather worse for wear. He claims to be a local noble down on his luck, and when he learns of my title he is quite impressed and asks whether I would consider buying a family heirloom of his since he in in dire need of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2974;I will buy your heirloom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2974;Keep your paltry trinket!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2975;The man accepts my payment and hands over the heirloom quickly, even if I definitely sense some reluctance. He wishes me luck on my journey and takes his leave, and I wonder whether he will consider the trade worth it down the line or if he will come to regret selling me his heirloom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2975;I'm sure he'll be fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2976;Though it is doubtful that I would have been asked to prove myself the most skilled warrior in the world if the Warriors of the Rising Sun did not believe in me there might be approaches to fighting that I have never seen before. A skilled foreign warrior offers to teach me a few tricks one day on the road, if I am willing to pay him for his time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2976;This sounds useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2976;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2977;One day on the road the weather takes a turn for the worse, and I soon find myself riding through heavy rain. I reach a village after a short while, and could definitely seek shelter there, but if I stay I might end up delayed noticeably as the roads could get worse, which I might be able to avoid if I keep going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2977;I must press on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2977;It is better to wait a while...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2978;I leave the village behind and press on despite the rain. It is not the most pleasant journey I have had, and the roads keep getting worse as I continue, but eventually the weather clears and the roads start improving again. Given the state of the roads behind me it was probably good that I kept going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2978;I made the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2979;I press on, leaving the village behind me. The downpour gets worse and worse, and my horse struggles to keep its footing from time to time. Though I eventually leave the worst of the downpour behind the roads improve a while after that, I am not sure that it was a good idea to keep going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2979;I feel unwell...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2980;The route I am taking to the location of the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] requires passing through a mountain range, and as I am making my way through the mountain pass I had planned to use I find that the way ahead has been blocked due to a rock slide. It would perhaps be possible to climb over the rocks, but circling back might be safer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2980;I will press on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2980;It would be best to circle back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2981;I dismount and start making my way past the rocks, leading my horse behind me. Though the path is somewhat treacherous I am able to make my way to the other side of the fallen rocks without too much trouble, and the way ahead appears to be free of obstacles as far as I can see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2981;That wasn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2982;I dismount and start making my way past the rocks, leading my horse behind me. The path I take is rather treacherous, with the rocks shifting beneath my feet as I move, and though I eventually make it to the other side I have injured myself a bit due to tripping a few times and failing to catch myself in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2982;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2983;One day on the road I come across a strange party of travellers, nine in total. Stopping briefly to converse with their leader I learn that they too are on a quest, seeking to bring about the end of some "dark lord". To my knowledge there is no such person, but perhaps they know something I do not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2983;Good luck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2983;Beware the Black Riders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2984;One night when I am sleeping at an inn in a small village along the road to the location of the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] I am awakened by the sound of someone moving nearby. Looking out through a crack between the shutters at the window I can see several shadowy figures moving around, likely not planning to conduct any honorable business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2984;Who goes there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2984;I must hide from them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2985;Being on the road without servants and with only a few different outfits has not always made it possible for me to wear the kind of attire that I would consider right and proper back in [Root.Capital.GetName], and at times I wonder whether it actually is worth bothering to make the attempt to look presentable as I keep getting dirty fairly quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2985;Being clean is important!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2985;I should care less...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2986;As I am having an evening meal in the inn of a small and unremarkable village I overhear several of the villagers discussing the subject of poetry. Apparently one of them fancies himself a poet, and the others seem appreciative of his poetry. Perhaps I should take the opportunity to share some poetry of my own poetry?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2986;I will share a poem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2986;I have no interest in this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2987;The villagers are a bit surprised to learn that I am a poet, but they are willing to listen to me recite one of my poems. Once I am finished they express their appreciation of my work, and the villager with poetic aspirations states that it is clear that he could improve, though he does not seem particularly upset.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2987;I knew they'd like that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2988;The villagers are a bit surprised to learn that I am a poet, but they are willing to listen to me recite one of my poems. By the time I am finished it is clear that they regret this decision, and several of them even go as far as suggesting that I should learn from their local poet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2988;They clearly know nothing of poetry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2989;Though my quest to seek out the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] currently is taking up all of my time I have other aspirations as well that I sometimes have not pursued as diligently as I could have. I really should make more of an effort to do so in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2989;Glory will be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2990;The quest to find the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] is taking up all of my time at the moment, and this has forced me to postpone several other plans I have. At first, I was not finding this to my liking, but the journey has made me reconsider whether those goals actually are worth pursuing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2990;I should be content with what I have...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2991;The journey to the location of the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] is taking longer than I initially had expected it to take, and though it at times have been interesting it is starting to become rather tedious. If I do not reach my destination soon, chances are I will need to vent my frustration in some other way than an honorable duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2991;Am I there yet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2992;Being on the road means I no longer have to deal with various matters I would have had to deal with if back home in [Root.Capital.GetName], and I find myself rather enjoying not having to work quite as hard. Perhaps I should take some time away from my work more often...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2992;I should take it easy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2993;As I am travelling by myself I have been forced to interact with all manner of people I normally would not have to interact with in [Root.Capital.GetName], and though I occasionally have been unable to communicate well due to language differences I have gotten better at knowing what to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2993;I'm sure this will be useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2994;One day when I am passing through a village on my way to face the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] I notice that they are holding a local festival of some kind. I take a look around to see just what that entails in this part of the world, and what I find is certainly different from anything I would encounter at a festival back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2994;They truly are uncultured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2994;That was quite interesting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2995;I have seen many wondrous sights on my journey to the location of the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent], but even so I am taken by surprise the day that I see a celestial dragon moving across the sky, its serpentine body gleaming in the sun. Few can claim to have seen such a majestic creature in person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2995;Auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2996;I have heard tales of strange beasts found in foreign lands in the past, but I have usually paid little attention to them as they have sounded rather fanciful. However, when I one day see a large winged creature fly past overhead I am forced to concede that perhaps the tales of fire-breathing dragons are true after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2996;I need to watch the skies...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2997;One day on the road nine figures completely shrouded in black come riding in the opposite direction. They all carry swords at their sides, and something about them puts ne at unease. One of them asks me if I have seen the party of someone named "Shiri", or perhaps "Bagin", who is in possession of something precious their lord lost long ago that he wants back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2997;I can't help you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2997;I might have seen them earlier...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2997;Perhaps you should check in Zeeland?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2998;I have met my fair share of odd people on the road, but one day I encounter a man that is stranger than most, who claims to be a prophet. Speaking in a rather melodramatic fashion, he declares that I need to ready myself to face the onslaught of the "Burning Empire", which apparently is coming to conquer all I hold dear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2998;What an odd man...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2998;He speaks the truth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2998;I am well aware!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_2998;We have already defeated them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2999;Being on the road on a quest for the Warriors of the Rising Sun has made me consider the virtues of the Shinto religion quite a bit, and I have started to wonder if the time perhaps has come to convert to it as I feel that some of its teachings are rather appealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2999;I will convert!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2999;I will convert... secretly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2999;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3000;Being on the road on a quest for the Warriors of the Rising Sun has made me consider the virtues of the Buddhist religion quite a bit, and I have started to wonder if the time perhaps has come to convert to it as I feel that some of its teachings are rather appealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3000;I will convert!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3000;I will convert... secretly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3000;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3001;The Warrios of the Rising Sun are closely tied to Japan, and though foreign warriors sometimes join the society and sometimes rise quite far it is harder to gain the respect of the other members if you are not Japanese, which I am quite aware of. Perhaps the time has come for me to fully embrace Japanese culture...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3001;I should become Japanese!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3001;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3002;There have been times during my voyage to face the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] when I have felt uncertain as to whether embarking on my quest was a good idea, but I am starting to feel more and more certain that I made the right decision and that [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] looks favorably on my quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3002;[Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] is with me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3003;Though things at times have gone well for me I have sometimes felt as if my life lacked purpose, and at times the world has seemed to be against me. However, the journey to face the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] has given me purpose, and I am starting to feel that things perhaps are changing for the better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3003;Life isn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3004;One day when I am having a meal at an inn a foreign woman takes a seat on the opposite side of my table. Introducing herself as a Hermetic scholar somewhat down on her luck, she offers to share some of her supposedly vast knowledge with me in exchange for a rather modest amount of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3004;Tell me what you know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3004;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3005;As I am travelling in foreign lands I have often found myself needing to ask for directions or needing to purchase maps of the areas I have been passing through, and though I doubt that the locals have been trying to mislead me there have been times when I have ended up taking the wrong path due to confusing instructions, such as today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3005;A temporary setback...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3006;As I am travelling in foreign lands I have often found myself needing to ask for directions or needing to purchase maps of the areas I have been passing through, and though I doubt that the locals have been going out of their way to help me they have sometimes let me know about useful shortcuts, such as today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3006;This is going well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3007;As I am passing through a thick forest I spot a group of people dressed in strange clothes standing together and chanting in some unknown language. They do not appear to have spotted me, but whatever they are doing is filling me with unease, and I might perhaps want to intervene before they accomplish whatever they are trying to accomplish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3007;They must be stopped!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3007;This does not concern me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3008;I attack the figures in the forest, cutting several of them down before they even realize I am there. Their attempt to resist is quite feeble, and I easily kill all of those that do not run. When I mention what happened when stopping in a nearby village the villagers are upset, as I apparently interrupted an ordinary religious ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3008;How could I have known?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3009;I attack the figures in the forest, cutting several of them down before they even realize I am there. Their attempt to resist is quite feeble, and I easily kill all of those that do not run. When I mention what happened when stopping in a nearby village the villagers are happy to hear that I stopped the ritual of a secretive local cult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3009;I only did what was right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3010;I attack the figures in the forest, cutting several of them down before they even realize I am there. I take a few minor wounds when they fight back, but I eventually manage to kill all of those that do not run. When I mention what happened to some local villagers they are upset, as I apparently interrupted a perfectly normal religious ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3010;How could I have known?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3011;I attack the figures in the forest, cutting several of them down before they even realize I am there.

EVTOPTA_SOH_3011;I only did what was right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3012;I attack the figures in the forest, cutting several of them down before they even realize I am there. I take a rather grievous wound in the fighting, but in the end I am triumphant. When I mention what happened to some local villagers they are upset, as I apparently interrupted a perfectly normal religious ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3012;How could I have known?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3013;I attack the figures in the forest, cutting several of them down before they even realize I am there. I take a rather grievous wound in the fighting, but in the end I amtriumphant. When I mention what happened to some local villagers they are quite happy to hear that I stopped what apparently was the ritual of a secretive local cult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3013;I only did what was right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3014;I attack the figures in the forest, cutting several of them down before they even realize I am there. However, they recover from their shock more quickly than I had anticipated, and I soon find myself surrounded. Though I fight to the best of my ability I am eventually overcome, and I fall to the ground, my vision fading...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3014;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3015;One day I notice a rather curious sight next the road I am travelling on. A fairly large bounder is standing all by itself, and a sword appears to somehow have been jammed into it, with little but the hilt visible. Looking more closely at it, I cannot really see how the sword ever ended up there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3015;I wonder if I can pull it free...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3015;I should keep going...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3016;I reach out and grab the hilt of the sword easily enough, attempting to pull it free with all of my strength. It does not appear to move at all, and despite making several more attempts I am unable to pull the sword free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3016;How odd...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3017;I reach out and grab the hilt of the sword easily enough, and I only need to make a token effort to pull it free. The blade is quite old, and I notice that the edge most definitely has become dull. It would not be useful as a weapon, and it is certainly not interesting enough to take with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3017;I should put this back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3018;I have come across a number of abandoned ruins and strange structures during my journey, and in the past I have not paid much attention to them. However, today I came across a rather larger stone circle, and I started to wonder if it perhaps would be worth investigating it more closely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3018;I will investigate it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3018;It would be a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3019;The stone circle is clearly something of human origin, and it has clearly not been used for quite some time as it is mostly overgrown. Taking a look around, I do not spot anything obvious that would let me guess as to its original purpose, and even when I decide to remove some of the moss I can find nothing of interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3019;That was a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3020;The stone circle is clearly something of human origin, and it has clearly not been used for quite some time as it is mostly overgrown. Taking a look around, I do not spot anything obvious that would let me guess as to its original purpose. When I remove some of the moss from one of the stones I manage find a depiction of two warriors engaged in a duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3020;Interesing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3021;One day I enter a village and overhear a herald proclaiming that there is a reward to be gained by the man or woman who can bring the head of a local bandit chief to the captain of the guard. Inquiring further, I learn that this bandit chief and his band of bandits has been causing the region a lot of trouble recently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3021;I will hunt him down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3021;I have better things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3022;I spend several days searching for the bandits that supposedly are hidden near the village, but I do not manage to find any sign of them. Perhaps they have moved on to another area, seeing as they are being actively hunted, or perhaps they are exceptionally good at hiding. Whatever the truth is, I cannot afford to keep looking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3022;I did my best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3023;By pure chance I stumble upon the bandits' trail easily enough, and I have no trouble at all following the trail to their encampment. As best I can tell, they are making preparations to depart, so if I do not choose to fight them it is very likely that they will slip away before anyone else can find them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3023;I will attack them right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3023;This is someone else's problem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3024;Confident in their ability to hide the bandits have not even posted sentries, and I am among them before they notice my presence. Several of them fall before they can pull their weapons free, and not even their chief puts up much a fight. It is a simple enough matter to behead the man and disperse his followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3024;That was easy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3025;The bandits have not seen fit to post sentries, but even so some of them spot me before I can get close to them, and they ready their weapons to fight me. The fighting is fierce, and I take a number of wounds during the battle, but eventually I manage to disperse them after beheading their leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3025;They fought well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3026;The bandits' sentries spot me as I make my approach, and I quickly find myself having to fight to move any further. I take a number of wounds in the fighting, and the fight initially does not seem to go my way. Eventually, I manage to kill the bandit chief, and the rest of them slip away. Pursuing them would be foolish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3026;That was far too close...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3027;I move towards the centre of the bandits' encampment, readying my weapon. Though it appears as if I have not been noticed at first I discover that I am mistaken when a volley of arrows suddenly comes at me. Several of them hit their mark, and the bandits waste no time closing in for the kill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3027;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3028;One day I notice that someone has carved something into the wall of a cliff just to the side of the road. Investigating the carvings I realize that it is a depiction of a number of strangely dressed warriors fighting duels with one another, and though some liberties clearly have been taken there are at least a couple of useful things depicted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3028;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3029;Being on the road with only a handful of possessions on me has made me consider whether I actually need everything I have back home even when I am there. Though there are things that I own that definitely are useful, I have perhaps been a bit too greedy in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3029;I don't need money to be happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3030;There are times when I feel that there has been far too many things that I have been expected to do as both a ruler and a warrior, and though some of them might have been rather important it has been exhausting to have to deal with all of those things. Now that I have been on the road for a while I have finally been able to relax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3030;This journey was good for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3031;At the Edge of the Dunes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3031;It has been a long journey, but I have finally arrived at the supposed location of the Sword of the Shifting Sands. Situated at the very edge of the Sahara Desert, the merchant city I have arrived at is larger than I had expected, and the people seem friendly enough despite the fact that I am an outsider.\n\nAsking the guards at the gate about the Sword of the Shifting Sands, I learn that the locals believe that the Sword can be found in one of the nearby oases, and that there likely are people in the city that would be able to guide me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3031;I should check in the bazaar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3032;I start asking the merchants in the bazaar whether they know how to get to the oasis of the Sword of the Shifting Sands. The first dozen or so claim that they have no idea, but eventually I find a cartographer who has a map of the area and who would be willing to mark the oasis for me, though the price he sets for the map is rather steep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3032;I'll buy your map!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3032;I'll get back to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3033;A couple of days after speaking to the cartographer I am approached by a young boy dressed in clothes similar to those worn by various desert tribesmen I have seen. He says that he knows that I seek the Sword of the Shifting Sands due to overhearing some gossip about me, and offers to guide me for a small sum of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3033;You're hired!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3033;I'll get back to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3034;As I continue asking around in the city I learn of an old man that supposedly has guided caravans through the desert for nearly sixty years. It is easy enough for me to find him in a house nearby, and when I ask about the oasis of the Sword of the Shifting Sands he offers his services as a guide in exchange for a modest amount of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3034;You seem competent enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3034;I'll get back to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3035;As I am taking a break from my search at a local inn a young woman with her face partially obscured by a veil sits down at my table without promting. She tells me that she is familiar with the oasis I seek, having been there before, and that she is on her way there, and offers to take me there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3035;I will accompany you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3035;I'll get back to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3036;I spend some more time asking around to see whether there are other options available, but after spending a few days without discovering any new leads I am forced to conculde that there is no other option than those I have discovered already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3036;I'll buy the map;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3036;I'll hire the boy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3036;I'll go with the old man;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3036;I'll accompany the woman;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3037;I leave the city the next morning, with the map I have purchased in my hand and plenty of extra water. Unless the map I purchased is incorrect it should be possible for me to travel from oasis to oasis until I reach my destination, and it should not take overly long to make this journey unless something unexpected happens along the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3037;This should be easy enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3039;The Sword of the Shifting Sands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_3039;I arrive at the oasis of the Sword of the Shifting Sands and discover that it is quite a bit larger than I had expected. Noticing that an ornately decorated stone building next to the water is the only sign of human habitation present I head there and enter through the surprising large gateway leading inside.\n\nInside the building I find the veiled woman I met at the inn waiting for me with a thin, curved sword in her hand and a small smile on her lips.\n\n"I was starting to wonder if I had gotten lost," she tells me. "I know why you are here, but custom dictates I tell me, even so.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_3039;I arrive at the oasis of the Sword of the Shifting Sands and discover that it is quite a bit larger than I had expected. Noticing that an ornately decorated stone building next to the water is the only sign of human habitation present I head there and enter through the surprising large gateway leading inside.\n\nInside the building I find a young woman waiting for me with a thin, curved sword in her hand and a small smile on her lips.\n\n"It seems I have a guest," she notes. "Tell me, why have you come here? Why have you sought out the Sword of the Shifting Sands?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3039;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3040;I and the young boy I hired agree to set off to the oasis of the Sword of the Shifting Sands in the morning, and I spend the rest of the day making preparations for the journey. The boy is waiting for me when I leave my room at the inn I have been staying at the next morning, seemingly impatient to depart from the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3040;He seems eager to please...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3041;I and my young guide have been on our way for several days and are heading through a ravine when an arrow comes flying past my head. Looking around, I notice that several armed men have appeared in every direction, and that the boy who hs guided me so far is nowhere to be found. It is not hard to figure out why that is the case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3041;He led me into an ambush!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3042;With the element of surprise lost, the bandits are no match for me, and most of them die before the survivours conclude that they need to flee. I see no reason to waste time riding them down, but now that I no longer have a guide I need to decide whether to try to get to the oasis on my own or to fall back to the city for directions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3042;I can find the way on my own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3042;I need directions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3043;The bandits fight hard and manage to wound me during the fighting, but the fight turns in my favor after a while and the survivours conclude that they need to flee. I see no reason to waste time riding them down, but now that I no longer have a guide I need to decide whether to try to get to the oasis on my own or to fall back to the city for directions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3043;I can find the way on my own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3043;I need directions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3044;The bandits fight hard, and I take a grievious wound in the fighting, but eventually the fight starts going my way and the remaining bandits turn around and flee. I see no reason to waste time riding them down, but now that I no longer have a guide I need to decide whether to try to get to the oasis on my own or to fall back to the city for directions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3044;I can find the way on my own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3044;I need directions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3045;I fight hard, and several bandits fall before me, but they qickly manage to inflict several wounds of their own and show no sign of being unwilling to continue fighting. It takes a while before it becomes clear which way the battle is going, but eventually it is clear that I will not be victorious, and I soon take a fatal wound...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3045;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3046;Leaving the site of the bandit ambush behind I depart in the direction of what seems to be an oasis, only to discover that it is nothing but a mirage. Concluding that I am lost, I decide to fall back, but after a while I find that my tracks have disappeared thanks to the wind, and with little water left there can only be one outcome...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3046;And so it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3048;The Sword of the Shifting Sands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_3048;I arrive at the oasis of the Sword of the Shifting Sands and discover that it is quite a bit larger than I had expected. Noticing that an ornately decorated stone building next to the water is the only sign of human habitation present I head there and enter through the surprising large gateway leading inside.\n\nInside the building I find the veiled woman I met at the inn waiting for me with a thin, curved sword in her hand and a small smile on her lips.\n\n"I was starting to wonder if I had gotten lost," she tells me. "I know why you are here, but custom dictates I tell me, even so.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_3048;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3049;I and the old man agree to depart the next morning, and he gives me a list of preparations I should make, such as making sure I can carry a good amount of water with me. By the time that I get to the old man's house the next morning I am having a good feeling about the journey ahead, and he also seems ot be in a good mood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3049;Lead on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3050;One day when I and the old man are riding through the desert he suddenly cluches his chest and falls off his horse. Though he lands relatively gently in a sand dune I discover that his heart is not beating and that his breathing has stopped. It seems his age finally has caught up to him, and as a consequence of this I no longer have a guide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3050;I can find the way on my own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3050;I need directions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3051;Leaving the old man's body behind I continue in the direction we were going, confident that I will be able to find the oasis I seek on your own. However, the arrival of a sandstorm  a few days later makes me lose my sense of direction, and I am unable to find either a source of water or the way back to the city I departed from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3051;And so it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3053;The Sword of the Shifting Sands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_3053;I arrive at the oasis of the Sword of the Shifting Sands and discover that it is quite a bit larger than I had expected. Noticing that an ornately decorated stone building next to the water is the only sign of human habitation present I head there and enter through the surprising large gateway leading inside.\n\nInside the building I find the veiled woman I met at the inn waiting for me with a thin, curved sword in her hand and a small smile on her lips.\n\n"I was starting to wonder if I had gotten lost," she tells me.

"Tell me, why have you come here? Why have you sought out the Sword of the Shifting Sands?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3053;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3054;Having returned to the city at the edge of the desert I find that there is nobody there that would be willing or able to guide me to my destination. The cartographer I spoke to earlier is however still willing to sell me the map that he offered me before for the same price he asked previously, so it seems as if there still is one option left.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3054;I guess I'll go with the map...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3054;I'd rather go home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3055;The young woman smiles slightly when I accept her offer to take me to the location of the Sword of the Shifting Sands and suggests that I should make sure that I get a good night's sleep and that I bring a lot of water. She asks me to meet her at the inn early the next morning, as she has some errands she needs to run before then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3055;I wonder why she seeks the oasis...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3056;As I and the veiled woman are making camp for the night in a smaller oasis on the way to the one where the Sword of the Shifting Sands supposedly can be found she suddenly leans in closely and plants a kiss on my lips, suggesting that perhaps the two of us could do something else during the rest of the evening than just engage in small talk over dinner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3056;I like the way you think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3056;I'd rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3056;I'm not really interested...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3057;I and my guide spend a rather enjoyable evening in one another's arms, with only a brief interruption to eat, and fall asleep together quite late, exhausted. Though I am a bit reluctant to get underway in the morning, we cannot stay where we are forever, and I have a quest to complete for the Warriors of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3057;We must press on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3058;My companion takes the rejection well enough, and though I half expected things to get a bit strained between the two of us due to what happened our conversation over dinner is pleasant enough, and the same can be said for the one we have over breakfast the next morning. Maybe I have nothing to worry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3058;Let's just keep moving...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3060;The Sword of the Shifting Sands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3060;I and the veiled woman arrive at the oasis that supposedly is the home of the Sword of the Shifting Sands, and she guides me to an ornately decorated stone building at one side of the surprisingly large pool of water in the oasis.\n\nOnce inside, she disappears off to one side briefly and returns with a thin, curved sword in her hand.\n\n"It has been a while since someone came to seek me out," she tells me. "We both know why you are here, but I believe that it is customary for the guest to inform the host why they have come, so please take care of the formalities.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3060;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3062;I and the Sword of the Shifting Sands begin our duel by probing each other's defenses carefully, and my initial impression of her capabilities is that she knows what she is doing. It takes quite a while before the outcome starts to become apparent, but eventually I disarm her, and she declares that she yields.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3062;Well fought, and farewell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3062;You should join my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3062;And now you die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3063;I and the Sword of the Shifting Sands begin our duel by probing each other's defenses carefully, and my initial impression of her capabilities is that she knows what she is doing. Though it takes quite a while before the outcome is clear she eventually gains the upper hand, and eventually she puts the tip of her sword at my throat and asks me if I yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3063;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3063;I'd rather die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3064;Under the Sign of the Cross;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3064;I have arrived in the small town where the Sword of Christ supposedly has been seen in the past. It is rather unremarkable, in my opinion, and the only really notable thing about the town is a small abbey that is the home of an order of monks.\n\nI question a few of the locals about the Sword of Christ when I arrive, but they claim that they cannot help me as the man only has visited the village infrequently in the past and his current location is uncertain. Hopefully, someone in the town is more informed than the average person, as it otherwise will be impossible to find the man I seek.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3064;Time to ask around...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3065;I spend some time asking around and am directed to speak to a man who apparently is a famous herald. He tells me that he believes he could track down the Sword of Christ for me relatively easily as he is known by many influential people nearby and thus could get answers I might not be able to get, but that his services are in high demand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3065;Name your price!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3065;Maybe later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3066;Telling the herald that I will see if there are other offers before hiring him I keep looking around the village for anyone that could help me out. To my surprise, a local child approaches me and suggests that perhaps the monks in the abbey know how to reach the Sword of Christ, seeing as he his a champion of Christianity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3066;I will speak to these monks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3066;Maybe later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3067;I keep walking through the streets of the town looking for other options. Towards the edge of the town furthest away from the abbey I notice that a building I had thought was an inn actually has a rather suggestive sign, and I conclude that it probably is a brothel. Though the Sword of Christ is unlikely to visit it, the prostitutes might have information.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3067;I can ask here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3067;Maybe later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3068;After going through the town one more time in the hopes of finding some other way to determine the location of the Sword of Christ I have concluded that there are no further options. I need to decide between the options I am aware of as I cannot afford to delay any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3068;I will hire the herald!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3068;I will ask the monks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3068;I will ask at the brothel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3069;I hire the famous herald and he immeidately readies his horse to set off. A few of the locals are nearby and notice what is going on, and they tell me that the man probably is one of the most honorable people to be found nearby, so it seems unlikely that he is planning to ride off with my money without doing what he was hired to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3069;I hope he returns quickly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3071;The monks at the abbey are quite pleased to meet me and have evidently heard of me as they bring up the subject of the Sword of Christ before I can get around to it. They immediately offer to send one of their number to find the man in question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3071;I knew they'd help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3072;The monks at the abbey are willing to speak with me despite the fact that I am not a Christian, but when I tell them that I seek the Sword of Christ they inform me that they are unwilling to send a message to him in the name of a heathen. They demand that I convert to Christianity if I wish for them to help me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3072;If I must...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3072;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3073;The monks are unhappy to learn that I am unwilling to convert, and they refuse to help me. As word likely will spread that the monks are upset with me, I will probably have to act quickly if I wish to find the Sword of Christ, and that means I will have to hire the herald despite it being rather expensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3073;I guess the herald will do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3073;I'd rather go home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3074;The owner of the brothel claims that she does not know anything about the Sword of Christ but that one of the prostitutes working there might know. She also tells me that she has a business to run, and that I will have to pay for the company of the prostitute in question even if I only want to ask her a question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3074;I suppose that's reasonable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3074;I'll look elsewhere...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3075;I pay the necessary gold to hire the prostitute that the brothel's owner claims might know the answer to my question, and I am directed to one of the rooms at the brothel. Inside I find a young woman waiting for me, who starts undressing almost as soon as I enter the room, evidently not expecting me to be there for any unusual reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3075;I'm just here to ask a question!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3075;I can ask my question later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3076;The prostitute is surprised to learn that I merely want to know the location of the Sword of Christ, but she does not seem particularly unhappy by this. She tells me she is reasonably certain that she knows where the man in question can be found, and offers to send one of the maids to find him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3076;She'd better hurry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3077;The prostitute is surprised to learn that I merely want to know the location of the Sword of Christ. She does not seem particularly unhappy by this, but she does not possess the information I seek. Given that I likely was seen entering the brothel the monks at the abbey are unlikely to be willing to help me, leaving me with just one option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3077;I guess the herald will do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3077;I'd rather go home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3078;I ask the prostitute about the Sword of Christ after sleeping with her, and though she seems rather surprised by the question she informs me that she is reasonably certain where he is. She offers to send one of the maids to find the man, and that seems like a reasonable idea to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3078;She'd better hurry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3079;I ask the prostitute about the Sword of Christ after sleeping with her, and she tells me that she does not know of the man. Given that it is very likely that I have been seen at the brothel I doubt that the monks at the abbey would be willing to help me any longer, so if I want to find the man I seek I will have to hire the herald.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3079;I guess the herald will do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3079;I'd rather go home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3080;Some days after my visit to the brothel I start to notice some discomfort when sitting down, and when I find a secluded place to undress I notice the signs of what I suspect is some kind of disease I must have picked up at the brothel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3080;That's not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3081;The Sword of Christ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3081;A few days after word was sent to the Sword of Christ one of the villagers comes running to fetch me, saying that the man in question has been sighted. I am led to one edge of the village and can see a man wearing an ornate suit of armor that is decorated with a multitude of crosses riding towards the village on a white stallion.\n\n"I assume it is you that requested my presence, my [Root.GetLordLady]," he says as he comes to a halt near me. "I suspect I know why you have come, but I would like to hear you say it even so.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3081;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3083;I and the Sword of Christ face off against each other in front of a large audience. Testing his defenses, I quickly determine that he will not be easily defeated. The duel remains undecided for quite some time, but I finally manage to get past his blade and put the tip of my sword at his throat, forcing him to yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3083;Well fought, and farewell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3083;You should join my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3083;And now you die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3084;I and the Sword of Christ face off against each other in front of a large audience. Testing his defenses, I quickly determine that he will not be easily defeated. The duel remains undecided for quite some time, but then it goes against me very suddenly and I find myself disarmed, with my opponent asking if I will yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3084;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3084;I'd rather die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3085;A Land of Runes and Raiders;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3085;I have finally arrived at the location where the Sword of Winter supposedly can be found. Though I know that there are Warriors of the Rising Sun that would use the word lightly the people in this inhospitable part of the world definitely are savages, and it is a bit strange that a warrior that supposedly is one of the best in the world can be found here.\n\nThe locals have expressed an interest in why I am here, but so far I have not found my opponent, and the only information I have obrained so far is that I am looking for an older woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3085;I just need to ask around a bit more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3086;It took me several days to find someone that knows where the Sword of Winter can be found, as she apparently is somewhat reclusive, but eventually a young warrior offered to guide me to her, telling me that she can be found in a place known as the Hall of Winter, which supposedly is located deep in the nearby forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3086;How quaint...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3088;In the Hall of Winter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3088;After travelling for several days in the company of my guide I arrive at a large longhouse deep in the forest. Two fierce-looking warriors stand guard at the entrance, but neither of them moves to stop me from entering.\n\nInside, I find a number of warriors seated around a long table upon which a large feast has been laid out. At the far end there is an ornately carved throne, upon which a fairly old woman is seated.\n\n"Ah, a challenger," she says when she notices me. "Since you so rudely have interrupted us in the middle of our meal, I request that you face off against some of my warriors before the two of us fight.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3088;I will take them all on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3088;I'm here for you, not for them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3089;The Sword of Winter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3089;The woman's expression sours as I refuse to fight her warrior, but she stands up and draws her sword.\n\n"A most rude guest indeed," she proclaims. "If not for the promise I made to the man who trained me, I would refuse your challenge."\n\nShe walks over to an open area to one side of the table while the others present motion for me to join her, with those that were seated on that side of the table moving elsewhere to get a better view of the duel that is about to begin.\n\n"Shall we begin?" the woman asks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3089;Let's fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3090;I have barely had time to agree to the Sword of Winter's request before the closest warriors are upon me, their weapons drawn. Though their assault is fierce, they are no match for someone as skilled as I am. The Sword of Winter watches with interest, but she does not seem overly concerned about her own chances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3090;Was that all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3091;U have barely had time to agree to the Sword of Winter's request before the closest warriors are upon me, their weapons drawn. Though their assault is fierce, and I am wounded in the fighting, but eventually I prevail. The Sword of Winter watches with interest, but she does not seem overly concerned about her own chances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3091;Time for the true fight...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3092;I have barely had time to agree to the Sword of Winter's request before the closest warriors are upon me, their weapons drawn. Their assault is fierce, and I take a grievious wound in the fighting, but eventually I prevail. The Sword of Winter watches with interest, and she does not seem overly concerned about her own chances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3092;This went rather poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3093;I have barely had time to agree to the Sword of Winter's request before the closest warriors are upon me, and they quickly overwhelm me.\n\n"It seems we shall not duel today," the Sword of Winter says as my vision fades. "I look forward to meeting you in Valhalla.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3093;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3094;The Sword of Winter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3094;"So, you are a good warrior after all," the Sword of Winter notes as she stands up, drawing her sword. "You managed to send all of my warriors to Valhalla despite being outnumbered, which definitely has earned you the honor of fighting me."\n\nShe moves over to an open area to one side of the now abandoned table, motioning for me to join her there.\n\n"It seems the Allfather himself will hear of this," the woman says, looking over at a pair of ravens that apparently have seen fit to perch to one side. "Ready yourself, and we shall see which one of us truly is the better warrior!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3094;Enough talk!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3096;Despite her age, the Sword of Winter turns out to still be a formidable warrior, and I do not notice any obvious weaknesses I could take advantage of at first. The two of us exchange blows for some time , but eventually I manage to disarm her. The Sword of Winter immediately yields when this happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3096;Well fought, and farewell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3096;You should join my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3096;And now you die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3097;Despite her age, the Sword of Winter turns out to still be a formidable warrior, and I do not notice any obvious weaknesses I could take advantage of. The two of us exchange blows for some time before the fight eventually goes against me and she manages to disarm me. She tells me that she wil spare my life if I yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3097;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3097;I'd rather die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3098;The Empty Expanse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3098;I have finally arrive at what should be the location where the Sword of the Steppes can be found, and it is only now that I have noticed a problem that should have been apparent sooner, namely that the lack of any permanent settlements in this region means that my opponent is nowhere to be found, and neither is anyone else.\n\nAs best I can tell, there is no obvious clue as to where the Sword of the Steppes or anyone that might know where he can be found, and I doubt that falling back to the last town I visited would be an option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3098;What do I do now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3099;Several days have passed since I started looking for signs of nearby nomads, and at last I have spotted a rider in the distance. They seem to be approaching, though whether this rider has any particular interest in me or merely is curious is hard to say. As I have not found anyone else to ask about the Sword of the Steppes I might as well speak to the rider.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3099;I doubt it'll hurt my chances...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3100;To my surprise the rider asks for me by name once he is close enough to be heard. As soon as I confirm that he has found me he reveals that he has been sent to find me as the Sword of the Steppes has heard of my quest and has asked for me to be brought to him as quickly as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3100;Lead on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3102;The Sword of the Steppes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3102;My guide leads me to a large nomad encampment where the sentries let me pass without comment. I am quickly taken to the center of the encampment where a large number of warriors have gathered in a half-circle facing a fairly young man, who turns to look at me as I draw near.\n\n"I was wondering how soon you would arrive," the young man says, slowly drawing his sword. "It has been a long time since one of the Warriors of the Rising Sun came to visit us, and it certainly is an honor. We both know why you are here, of course, but I still ask that you state it clearly.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3102;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3104;I draw my sword and move to engage the Sword of the Steppes, only having time to take a few steps before the man reaches me, driving me back several steps as he unleashes a flurry of blows. Though it hard to gain the upper hand I eventually manage to find an opening in his defenses, and I put the tip of my sword at his throat, forcing him to yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3104;Well fought, and farewell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3104;You should join my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3104;And now you die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3105;I draw my sword and move to engage the Sword of the Steppes, only having time to take a few steps before the man reaches me, driving me back several steps as he unleashes a flurry of blows. I manage to deflect several of them, but eventually the man's sword slips past my defenses, with the tip coming to rest at my throat. The man asks if I will yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3105;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3105;I'd rather die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3106;A Matter of Bureaucracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3106;I have arrived at the supposed location of the Sword of the Dragon, which apparently is one of the largest cities I have ever seen, and I am hardly the only one that wishes to enter the city considering the long line at the gate.\n\nWhen it finally is my turn to enter the guards at the gate inquire as to why I have come, and when they hear that I seek the Sword of the Dragon they inform me that those that seek the man need to speak to one of the local government officials in one of the buildings overlooking the central market of the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3106;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3107;I arrive at the building the guards told me to go to and quickly manage to arrange a meeting with the man who supposedly is in charge of matters concerning the Sword of the Dragon. He informs me that many seek the Sword of the Dragon and that only someone that passes a written test gets to meet the Sword... unless the officials get paid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3107;I'll pay you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3107;I'll take the test!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3108;Despite the fact that the man asks for quite a lot of money I am unwilling to waste time on a test that apparently has nothing to do with fighting, so I agree to pay him to avoid it. Doubtlessly there are those among the Warriors of the Rising Sun who will be displeased by this, but I still think I have made the right decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3108;I'm sure people will understand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3110;The first part of the test I have to take consists of making a written statement explaining in detail why I deserve to face off against an opponent as auspicious as the Sword of the Dragon. I would have thought that my reputation would have preceded me, but apparently it is insufficient to convince the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3110;I think my statement was good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3111;The second part of the test consists of a number of questions regarding the Art of War, some of them trivially easy, others quite challenging. As I have discussed warfare with others in the past I am not entirely unprepared, and I feel like my answers might be good enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3111;I think I got it right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3112;The third part of the test appears to have nothing to do with the Sword of the Dragon, warfare, or other matters that could be relevant, since it asks a number of questions regarding how a ruler should govern their realm. I ask the man that handed it to me whether I got the wrong test, and he assures me it is the right one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3112;This was a rather odd test...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3113;The fourth part of the test contains a number of riddles, which is a rather odd subject as far as I am concerned, but seeing as the previous test also was rather unrelated to the matter at hand I am not entirely surprised. Several of the riddles are rather tricky, but I eventually arrive at decent answers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3113;This was rather tricky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3114;The fifth and final part of the test is a number of questions regarding notable Chinese works. As with the previous two tests it does not seem particularly relevant, but I am assured that this indeed is the test I should be taking, and I eventually manage to answer all of the questions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3114;I hope I get the results soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3116;The official I spoke to first meets with me again a few days after I took the test, informing me that my answers have been deemed acceptable and that a messenger has been sent to the Sword of the Dragon, who apparently is elsewhere at the moment. I am offered a room to stay in until your opponent arrives, which I see no reason to refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3116;I hope he arrives soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3117;The official I spoke to first meets with me again a few days after I took the test, informing me that my answers were not good enough to warrant a duel with the Sword of the Dragon. I will either have to pay for the duel to be arranged or have to leave without issuing my challenge, which would mean failing my quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3117;I guess I have to pay...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3117;I'd rather go home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3118;The Sword of the Dragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3118;Several days after the messenger was sent I receive word that the Sword of the Dragon is on his way to the city but that the journey still will take him several more days. A few days later, I am asked to accompany the local bureaucrats outside to meet the man.\n\nAs I exit the building where I have been staying I can see a large column of soldiers approaching the front steps, led by a single rider on a fine horse. He raises a hand to bring the soldiers to a halt and dismounts, walking over to me.\n\n"I suspect that it is you that have summoned me," he says. "Tell me, what do you want?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3118;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3120;Though the Sword of the Dragon arrived accompanied by a large number of soldiers I did not initially expect him to be a good warrior, but he turns out to be a skilled opponent. However, though he fights well he is not good enough to defeat me, and I eventually manage to disarm him, forcing him to yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3120;Well fought, and farewell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3120;You should join my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3120;And now you die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3121;Though the Sword of the Dragon arrived accompanied by a large number of soldiers I did not initially expect him to be a good warrior, but he turns out to be a skilled opponent. I think I might be able to prevail at first, but eventually he manages to disarm me, upon which he asks me if I will yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3121;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3121;I'd rather die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3122;A Land of Many Gods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3122;The location I was told to head to in order to find the Sword of Serpents is deep in the jungles of India, which seems like a rather strange place for a renowned warrior to be located, but based on the information I have managed to obtain along the way the man is indeed found somewhere in the jungle, and he is supposedly some kind of madman in addition to being a skilled warrior.\n\nUpon arriving at the location I have been told to go to I find that there is nothing there except for a rather small village, which is strange since I have heard that the Sword of Serpents' home is quite grand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3122;I hope I'm not in the wrong place...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3123;After speaking to the villagers I am given directions to the true location of the Sword of Serpents, which apparently is an ancient temple deeper into the jungle. The villagers tell me that they do not really understand why anyone would want to live there, but as I have heard that I seek a madman it does not surprise me overly much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3123;I suppose I will head there...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3125;In the Heart of the Jungle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3125;The journey through the jungle to the old temple where the Sword of Serpents supposedly can be found is rather difficult, and it takes me several days to get to my destination, which turns out to be a bit grander than I had expected it to be.\n\n"Welcome!" a voice calls out from one of the upper levels, where I can see a man standing on a balcony. "You must be here to fight me!" He laughs a bit before continuing. "You will have to pass through the challenges inside to reach me!"\n\nWith that, he disappears inside, letting out yet another laugh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3125;Let's see what is inside...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3126;The first few rooms inside are empty, and I start to wonder if there truly are challenges as pass go through them. However, as I reach the base of a large stairway IU notice that what I initially thought was a bunch of vines covering the stairs instead is a number of hooded snakes, which doubtless are not going to be friendly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3126;I can get past them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3126;I can't risk this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3127;I start making my way up the stairs, moving as carefully as I can between the snakes. Unfortunately I am not careful enough, and the snakes soon make their displeasure known. Though I attempt to fend them off with my sword, several of them still manage to bite me, and I collapse to the ground, my vision darkening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3127;And so it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3128;I start making my way up the stairs, moving as carefully as I can between the snakes. Though they do not seem entirely pleased to have someone move past them they do not attack me, and eventually I manage to reach the top of the stairs, entering a snake-free passage leading elsewhere in the temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3128;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3129;I pass through several more empty rooms before reaching the next set of stairs. At first it looks as if there is nothing special to be found there, but when I accidentally kick a small rock over towards the base of the stairs a small section of the floor drops down and an arrow flies past me. Evidently the room is trapped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3129;I can do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3129;This is too dangerous...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3130;I study the floor and the stairs carefully before moving, taking note of anything that looks like a pressure plate. Though I get quite far without a misstep IU eventually make a mistake, and an arrow hits me in the shoulder. It has evidently been posioned, seeing as the strength leaves my body very quickly, and as I fall I trigger several more traps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3130;NOOOOO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3131;I study the floor and the stairs carefully before moving, taking note of anything that looks like a pressure plate. Several of them are hard to make out, and I almost step in the wrong place a number of times, but I successfully make my way across the room and up the stairs, and the room above is free from traps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3131;Next challenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3132;As I continue through the temple I notice that there no longer appears to be just one way forward, and I start to suspect that I have entered a labyrinth. Given the sheer size of the temple, it is likely very extensive, and if I got lost it is not certain that I would be able to find the exit again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3132;I can do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3132;This is too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3133;I begin making my way through the labyrinth, doing my best to remember which way I turn at each intersection. The temple is large enough that it takes me several hours before I conclude that I am lost, and though I try to find my way out of the labyrinth again I do not manage to do so, and the hours soon turn to days...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3133;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3134;I begin making my way through the labyrinth, doing my best to remember which way I turn at each intersection. Just as I start wondering whether I have gotten lost I find myself at the base of a grand staircase, and at the top of it I can see a pair of ornately decorated doors, which likely lead to where my opponent waits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3134;That wasn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3135;The Sword of Serpents;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3135;I push the ornate doors open and go through the doorway, finding myself in a large chamber containing a number of large statues of men and women clad in elaborate clothing of unknown significance. I can see the Sword of Serpents sitting with his legs crossed towards the opposite side of the room, and he looks up expectantly as I draw closer.\n\n"You're here!" the madman exclaims, jumping to his feet. "People said that it was a stupid idea to add the snakes, and the pressure plates, and the labyrinth, but I knew I was right!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3135;Time to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3137;Despite the fact that the Sword of Serpents is something of a madman, he clearly knows how to fight, and his style incorporates a large number of feints. However, eventually I manage to make out a pattern, and I beat his sword aside with mine and put the tip of my sword at his throat. The Sword of Serpents immediately yields.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3137;Well fought, and farewell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3137;You should join my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3137;And now you die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3138;Despite the fact that the Sword of Serpents is something of a madman, he clearly knows how to fight, and his style incorporates a large number of feints. I manage to fend him off for a while, but eventually he gets through my defenses, and I find myself with the tip of his sword at my throat. He asks if I wish to yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3138;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3138;I'd rather die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3139;I have finally returned home from my journey to seek out one of the greatest warriors in the world. Perhaps I will find reason to journey somewhere else in the future, but right now I really should investigate whether there are things at home that require my attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3139;Home, sweet home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3140;A Challenge at Home;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3140;One uneventful day one of my servants comes running, telling me that an old man has arrived and is requesting to meet me. I decide to grant the man an audience, and when he enters I notice that he is armed and definitely walks as if he knows how to fight.\n\n"At last we meet," the man says, inclining his head slightly. "You have travelled across the land, searching far and wide, and have defeated all six of my most promising students. You certainly show promise, but if you wish to prove that you truly are the very best warrior in the world you must face me now, in a duel to the death.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3140;Challenge accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3140;I would rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3142;The Undisputed Champion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3142;I and the Unknown Master draw our swords as a crowd gathers nearby. I slowly move closer, and my opponent does likewise, each of us studying each other's moves carefully. We both make careful probing attacks, and both of us deal with them easily enough, neither giving anything away. It is clear that the duel will not be decided quickly.\n\nI am pressed to my limits by my opponent, but eventually the duel starts going my way, and I inflict a number of small wounds on my opponent before finally beheading him with one swift strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3142;I am the very best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3143;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName] finally has managed to prove [From.GetHerselfHimself] the very best warrior in all the world, defeating seven skilled opponents in the process. It is doubtful that anyone else will be given the opportunity to do something similar while [From.GetBestName] still lives, so the achievement is unlikely to be matched anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3143;Impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3144;A Final and Fatal Defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3144;I and the Unknown Master draw our swords as a crowd gathers nearby. I slowly move closer, and my opponent does likewise, each of us studying each other's moves carefully. We both make careful probing attacks, and both of us deal with them easily enough, neither giving anything away. It is clear that the duel will not be decided quickly.\n\nI am pressed to my limits by my opponent, and though it at times seems as if I might be able to prevail I make one mistake too many, and my opponent inflicts several wounds on you in quick succession, one of them fatal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3144;And so it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3145;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName] has failed in [From.GetHerHis] quest to prove that [From.GetSheHe] is the best warrior in the world. Doubtlessly, someone else will get the opportunity to do so in the future, but one thing is clear, and it is that the Warriors of the Rising Sun were wrong to put their faith in the skills of [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3145;How disappointing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3148;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetBestName],\nThe Warriors of the Rising Sun appear to have been wrong to put their faith in you and your skills, as you have failed to prove that you are the best warrior to be found. Perhaps you will be able to redeem yourself in the future, but perhaps not...\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3148;I am a disappointment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3000;Being on the road on a quest for the Warriors of the Rising Sun has made me consider the virtues of the Shugendo religion quite a bit, and I have started to wonder if the time perhaps has come to convert to it as I feel that some of its teachings are rather appealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3149;I will convert!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3149;I will convert... secretly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3149;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3150;Being on the road on a quest for the Warriors of the Rising Sun has made me consider the virtues of the Koshin religion quite a bit, and I have started to wonder if the time perhaps has come to convert to it as I feel that some of its teachings are rather appealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3150;I will convert!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
