General guidelines moving forward:
- Event localization goes in files named after the event file.
- Some common localization ("Ok", etc.) exists in CleanSlate; there's no need to localize such tags if you use the CleanSlate tag.
- Titles, cultures, etc. are sorted alphabetically.
- Events are sorted event by event.
