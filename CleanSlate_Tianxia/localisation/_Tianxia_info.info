General guidelines moving forward:
- IMPORTANT: The LAST instance of a given tag in the FIRST file containing the tag takes precedence.
- Event localization should be separated into files named after the event file.
- Event localization should be sorted event by event, not DESC -> OPTA -> ... -> TITLE; it makes things a lot more readable.
- Titles, cultures, etc. are sorted alphabetically.
