# Court Mu
EVTDESC_SOH_301;I have ordered my servants to look both near and far for a good candidate to be my new Court Mu, as I will need someone to manage various rituals at my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_301;I hope they find someone quickly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_303;One of the servants I dispatched to look for a possible Court Mu has sent word that he has discovered a promising [possible_mu.GetManWoman] in a town some distance away. [possible_mu.GetSheHeCap] is apparently a local healer of some renown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_303;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_303;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_304;Word has arrived from one of the servants I dispatched to search for a possible Court Mu that there is a travelling mystic in my realm that could be a good candidate, and based on what I have heard [possible_mu.GetSheHe] could indeed be the [possible_mu.GetManWoman] for the job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_304;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_304;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_305;I have received a message from one of my servants informing me that they have found a foreign-born [possible_mu.GetManWoman] who could be a good Court Mu. [possible_mu.GetSheHeCap] is perhaps not quite what people would expect, but it would still be possible to hire [possible_mu.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_305;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_305;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_306;A [possible_mu.GetManWoman] has arrived at my court and has informed my servants that [possible_mu.GetSheHe] has heard that I am looking for a Court Mu. [possible_mu.GetSheHeCap] claims to be a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] that would be well suited for that job, and I could probably do worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_306;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_306;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_307;A message has arrived from a nearby temple that they know of a theologian of some renown who could be convinced to serve as my Court Mu. [possible_mu.GetBestName] could indeed be the [possible_mu.GetManWoman] I am looking for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_307;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_307;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_308;One of my servants has sent a message that she has come across a scholar that very likely could be a good Court Mu for me. [possible_mu.GetBestName] is not known to me, but the servant that sent word has always been reliable in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_308;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_308;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_309;I have received word from one of my guards that there apparently is a young [possible_mu.GetManWoman] that recently was initiated as the Mu of a small village nearby. It is very likely [possible_mu.GetSheHe] would be willing to work as my Court Mu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_309;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_309;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_310;I have received word that there is a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] near my capital that recently was initiated as a Mu but that remained possessed after the initiation ceremony. Though this is highly unusual, [possible_mu.GetSheHe] could potentially be a suitable Court Mu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_310;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_310;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_311;I have learned that one of my servants apparently would be a reasonable Court Mu. [possible_mu.GetBestName] could indeed be a decent candidate, even though [possible_mu.GetSheHe] is known to be a bit... odd...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_311;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_311;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_312;One of my agents has sent word that there is a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] in a distant part of my realm that possibly could be a good Court Mu. [possible_mu.GetSheHe] supposedly is a very strong believer, and well versed in Muist rituals and teachings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_312;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_312;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_313;I have been told that one of my agents discovered a potential Court Mu by pure accident when he was having a drink at a local tavern and came across a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] that seemed like a rather good candidate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_313;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_313;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_314;I have learned that there is a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] in my realm that potentially would be a good Court Mu. [possible_mu.GetSheHeCap] is apparently a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] of learning, and not entirely unfamiliar with Muist rituals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_314;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_314;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_315;I have learned that there is a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] in my realm that potentially would be a good Court Mu. [possible_mu.GetSheHeCap] is apparently a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] of learning, and decently familiar with Muist rituals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_315;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_315;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_316;I have learned that there is a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] in my realm that potentially would be a good Court Mu. [possible_mu.GetSheHeCap] is apparently a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] of learning, and quite familiar with Muist rituals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_316;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_316;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_317;I have learned that there is a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] in my realm that potentially would be a good Court Mu. [possible_mu.GetSheHeCap] is apparently a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] of learning, and exceptionally familiar with Muist rituals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_317;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_317;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_318;One of the agents I sent to find me a Court Mu has sent word that she has discovered a possible candidate. The [possible_mu.GetManWoman] is not particularly remarkable, but that is not necessarily a problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_318;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_318;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_319;It seems one of my relatives, [possible_mu.GetBestName], would be a potential Court Mu, or at least that is what I have been told. [possible_mu.GetSheHeCap] seems quite willing to take the job, too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_319;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_319;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_320;I have received word that one of my vassals, [possible_mu.GetBestName], seems to be a fairly good choice as my Court Mu, and [possible_mu.GetSheHe] is not an entirely disagreeable choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_320;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_320;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Gut
EVTDESC_SOH_321;I have received a request from [From.GetBestName] to perform a Gut ritual for [From.GetHerHim], and as [From.GetHerHis] Court Mu I am expected to do that when it is requested. Some money has been set aside for the ritual, according to what I have been told.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_321;I will begin my preparations at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_321;I should ask for more money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_322;My Court Mu, [From.GetBestName], has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] would prefer to have more money made available for the Gut as there are quite a few things that need to be arranged for the ritual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_322;You shall have more money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_322;I think I've given you enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_323;[From.GetBestName] has seen fit to grant me extra funds for the Gut ritual I am to perform. I should spend this money on the ritual as I said, but perhaps there are other ways I could use it that are more appealing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_323;I will make all possible preparations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_323;This calls for a drink! Or ten!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_323;I think I'll keep this for now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_323;Time to make a run for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_324;Apparently my Court Mu had other plans for the money I gave [From.GetHerHim] than extensive preparations for the Gut ritual, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] was found passed out in a local tavern this morning after having spent quite a bit of the money on drinks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_324;Perhaps I need a new Court Mu...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_325;It seems I had a few too many drinks last night as I woke up to the sound of  one of [From.GetBestName]'s guard yelling at me and discovered that I apparently had passed out in a local tavern and only was discovered well after the Gut was supposed to begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_325;Maybe this was a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_326;[From.GetBestName], my Court Mu, could not be found when the ritual was supposed to begin, and when my servants started asking around they learned that [From.GetSheHe] apparently had been seen riding off into the distance. It seems [From.GetSheHe] decided to take my money and run.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_326;I want this thief caught!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_327;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that no more funds will be made available for the Gut ritual, stating that what was set aside initially should be more than sufficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_327;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_329;It is almost time for the Gut to begin, and I need to decide whether I think a Dodang-gut, asking for well-being and prosperity, or a Ssitgim-gut, placating the spirits of the deceased, is what I am aiming for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_329;A Dodang-gut sounds right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_329;A Ssitgim-gut would be appropriate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_330;It is almost time for the Gut to begin, and my Court Mu, [From.GetBestName], has informed me that it will be a Dodang-gut, hopefully resulting in well-being and prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_330;I look forward to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_331;It is almost time for the gut to begin, and my Court mu, [From.GetBestName], has informed me that it will be a Ssitgim-gut, hopefully resulting in the spirits of the dead being placated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_331;I look forward to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_334;As the Gut begins [FromFrom.GetBestName] makes sure to purify the altar with fire and water, before burning white paper to ensure purification of the body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_334;Of course [FromFrom.GetSheHe] wouldn't forget that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_335;I begin the Gut in accordance with custom, purifying the altar with fire and water, and then burn white paper to ensure purification of the body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_335;Surely nobody would forget to do this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_336;As the Gut begins [FromFrom.GetBestName] does not purify the altar with fire and water as one would expect, and [FromFrom.GetSheHe] also does not burn white paper to ensure purification of the body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_336;How could [FromFrom.GetSheHe] forget that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_337;I begin the Gut and welcome everyone present, quickly moving through the steps of the ritual. It is only after I have gone through several things that I realize that I forgot the initial purification of the altar and the body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_337;I really should have remembered that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_340;As the Gut continues [FromFrom.GetBestName] starts reciting a myth concerning the deities that are about to be invoked. It is a rather familiar myth, and naturally my Court Mu does a flawless job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_340;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_341;I continue with the Gut and take some time to recite a myth about the deities I am about to invoke. It is a myth that most people are familiar with, and judging by the faces of those that are listening to me I do a very good job reciting it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_341;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_342;[FromFrom.GetBestName] starts reciting a familiar myth about the deities to be invoked at the Gut, but before long the things [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is saying start sounding very wrong, and the mistakes [FromFrom.GetSheHe] make are more than just a few.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_342;Doesn't [FromFrom.GetSheHe] know this myth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_343;I continue with the Gut and start reciting a myth about some of the deities I mean to invoke. However, I quickly find that I do not remember it as well as I thought I did, and judging by the faces of those around me they have noticed the mistakes I have made reciting the myth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_343;Well, that didn't go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_346;The Gut continues, and [FromFrom.GetBestName] is really not doing things the way anyone would have expected. Many Mu have their own style, so it is reasonable for there to be some deviation, but this really is far too different from what would be proper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_346;What was all that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_347;I continue with the Gut, but as it continues I find myself forgetting just what it is I am supposed to do. I thought I had prepared well enough to pull this charade off, but I am really starting to have second thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_347;That did not go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_348;My Court Mu, [FromFrom.GetBestName], continues with the Gut, carrying out ritual after ritual in a fashion that I doubt that even the most zealous of zealots could find any fault with. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] really is a remarkable [FromFrom.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_348;Well done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_349;I continue with the Gut, mindful of all the things I have read up on about the rituals I am performing. At first, I wonder if the audience will suspect that I am not a proper Mu, but none of them seem to think that anything is amiss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_349;My preparations paid off!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_350;The Gut continues, and though [FromFrom.GetBestName] seems to know the required rituals quite well what [FromFrom.GetSheHe] does and says is borderline offensive to me and some of my guests. I know my Court Mu is common-born, but this really is beyond what I would expect even from a commoner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_350;Perhaps I should find a less rude Court Mu?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_351;I continue with the Gut and carry out the appropriate rituals, making sure to pay attention to the audience as a whole and not just [From.GetBestName] and [From.GetHerHis] friends. However, judging by the facial expressions of the more prominent members of the audience, this might be coming across as rude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_351;I might have made a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_352;I know very well that my Court Mu is a foreigner and that customs might be rather different elsewhere, but some of the things [FromFrom.GetBestName] is doing during the Gut are quite a bit stranger than I had expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_352;How curious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_352;This is not proper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_353;I carry out the Gut in accordance with the customs of my people, which seems to surprise many of those in attendance as local rituals apparently are quite a bit different. Some of them even look a bit offended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_353;I assure you this is correct!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_354;Some of the commoners in attendance at the Gut being performed by [FromFrom.GetBestName] are in need of medical assistance, and my Court Mu makes it known that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] will help them to the best of [FromFrom.GetHerHis] ability as soon as the Gut is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_354;How kind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_355;I am quite aware that some of the people in attendance at the Gut are in need of medical assistance, and I make sure to let them know that I will help them to the best of my ability as soon as it is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_355;I am always willing to help the sick!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_356;As the Gut continues my Court Mu gets a strange expression on [FromFrom.GetHerHis] face and then starts speaking in a completely different voice. It is not uncommon for spirits to possess a Mu during a Gut, but the things [FromFrom.GetBestName] says are quite unusual, and I do not seem to be the only one thinking that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_356;Well, that happened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_357;As the Gut continues I feel a presence in my head that I have never felt before. Words come pouring in, some of them beautiful, some of them terrible, and I know that I know the truth, and that the truth must be set free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_357;THESE WORDS MUST BE SPOKEN!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_358;[FromFrom.GetBestName] calls out for the spirits and any deities nearby to give [FromFrom.GetHerHim] their blessing and to look kindly on the Gut and those that are there. I can almost feel something answer [FromFrom.GetHerHis] call.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_358;I am glad I hired [FromFrom.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_359;I continue with the Gut, going through several rituals carefully, and then reach out, calling for any spirits or deities that might be nearby to bless me and the others at the Gut.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_359;Join us! Bless us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_360;I have known that [FromFrom.GetBestName] is quite learned for a long time, but until today I do not know I if really had a good sense of just how learned [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is. The Gut is quite exceptional, and is going extremely well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_360;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] is truly a good Mu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_361;I continue with the Gut and put all the various knowledge I have acquired in the past to good use. Judging by the expressions I can see on the faces of those in the audience, I must be doing a very good job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_361;I think this went very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_362;My Court Mu, [FromFrom.GetBestName], takes some time during the Gut to give a speech about the Muist faith and how everyone must do everything in their power to ensure that it triumphs over all other faiths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_362;Our faith is the only true faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_363;My Court Mu, [FromFrom.GetBestName], takes some time during the Gut to give a speech about the Muist faith and how everyone must do everything in their power to ensure that it triumphs over all other faiths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_363;I suppose [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_363;I think this is rather improper...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_364;As the Gut continues I take some time to give a short speech to the crowd, telling all present that the Muist faith must triumph over all other faiths and how every Muist must work towards this goal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_364;Our faith is the only true faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_367;My court Mu continues with the Dodang-gut, and though I am unsure whether there actually are any spirits around to bring prosperity and well-being the commoners in the audience seem impressed. If they are impressed they will surely work much harder, which should bring prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_367;I suppose that works...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_368;I continue with the Dodang-gut, and though it is possible that not everyone in the audience is convinced that the spirits will bring prosperity and well-being it seems many of the commoners are quire impressed, and I suspect that they will work harder as a result, which likely will bring prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_368;And the spirits will also help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_369;The Dodang-gut continues, and [FromFrom.GetBestName] calls for the spirits to bring prosperity and well-being. I am unsure if anyone actually feels the spirits are listening, but at the very least the commoners seem thankful a Gut is being held.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_369;I suppose that's good enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_370;I continue with the Dodang-gut and call for the spirits to bring prosperity and well-being. Nobody in the audience seems particularly convinced that the spirits are listening, but at least they do not seem to be unhappy with the Gut.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_370;It could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_371;As my Court Mu continues with the Dodang-gut and call for the spirits to bring prosperity and well-being I can feel something stirring in the air. It seems the spirits truly are listening to my Court Mu, and that my lands truly will be blessed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_371;This was a good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_372;I call for the spirits to bring prosperity and well-being as I continue with the Dodang-gut, and I can feel the air stir as the answer my call. [From.GetBestName] will doubtlessly be very pleased by this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_372;Thank you, spirits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_373;[FromFrom.GetBestName] continues with the Dodang-gut, calling for the spirits to bring prosperity and well-being. Many in the audience look rather skeptical of the whole thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_373;Well, that's not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_374;I continue with the Dodang-gut and call for the spirits to bring prosperity and well-being. Despite carrying out various rituals properly, a large part of the audience seems rather skeptical of the whole thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_374;Well, that's not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_375;Though I believe that [FromFrom.GetBestName] carries out the Dodang-gut quite well the commoners in the audience seem quite displeased by the whole thing, with several of them crying out in anger as the Gut continues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_375;This could be bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_376;I continue with the Dodang-gut and carry out the rituals quite properly, but something seems to have upset the audience even so as many of the commoners become agitated and cry out that I am a poor Mu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_376;This is not going as expected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_378;As the Ssitgim-gut continues I need to figure out just what I am going to say that the spirits of the deceased supposedly are thinking about [From.GetBestName] and [From.GetHerHis] conduct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_378;I'll claim they are happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_378;I'll claim they are indifferent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_378;I'll claim they are upset!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_378;I will claim someone feels angry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_378;I will claim someone feels forgiving!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_379;I am having trouble determining just how the spirits feel about [From.GetBestName], and the Ssitgim-gut has reached the point where I need to say something about how they feel. My best guess is that they probably are happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_379;They are probably happy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_379;I'll claim they are indifferent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_379;I'll claim they are upset!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_380;I am having trouble determining just how the spirits feel about [From.GetBestName], and the Ssitgim-gut has reached the point where I need to say something about how they feel. My best guess is that they probably are indifferent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_380;I'll claim they are happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_380;They are probably indifferent...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_380;I'll claim they are upset!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_381;I am having trouble determining just how the spirits feel about [From.GetBestName], and the Ssitgim-gut has reached the point where I need to say something about how they feel. My best guess is that they probably are upset.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_381;I'll claim they are happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_381;I'll claim they are indifferent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_381;They are probably upset...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_382;I am having trouble determining just how the spirits feel about [From.GetBestName], and the Ssitgim-gut has reached the point where I need to say something about how they feel. My best guess is that someone might be angry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_382;Someone is probably angry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_382;I'll claim someone is feeling forgiving!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_383;I am having trouble determining just how the spirits feel about [From.GetBestName], and the Ssitgim-gut has reached the point where I need to say something about how they feel. My best guess is that someone might feel forgiving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_383;I'll claim someone is angry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_383;Someone is probably feeling forgiving...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_384;As the Ssitgim-gut continues I suddenly get a sense of just how the spirits must feel about [From.GetBestName] and [From.GetHerHis] conduct. There is no mistake whatsoever, and I must say what I have been told.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_384;They must be happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_384;They must be indifferent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_384;They must be upset!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_384;They must be feeling angry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_384;They must be feeling forgiving!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_385;I have reached the point of the Ssitgim-gut where I need to reveal how the spirits feel about [From.GetBestName], and just as I am about to speak I get a good sense of what I have to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_385;I know they are happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_386;I have reached the point of the Ssitgim-gut where I need to reveal how the spirits feel about [From.GetBestName], and just as I am about to speak I get a good sense of what I have to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_386;I know they are indifferent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_387;I have reached the point of the Ssitgim-gut where I need to reveal how the spirits feel about [From.GetBestName], and just as I am about to speak I get a good sense of what I have to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_387;I know they are upset!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_388;I have reached the point of the Ssitgim-gut where I need to reveal how the spirits feel about [From.GetBestName], and just as I am about to speak I get a good sense of what I have to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_388;I know someone is feeling angry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_389;I have reached the point of the Ssitgim-gut where I need to reveal how the spirits feel about [From.GetBestName], and just as I am about to speak I get a good sense of what I have to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_389;I know someone is feeling forgiving!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_390;As the Ssitgim-gut continues [From.GetBestName] makes it known that the spirits are most pleased with me and my conduct, and that they look favorably on the Ssitgim-gut as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_390;This pleases me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_390;I rather doubt they are happy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_391;I inform [From.GetBestName] that the spirits are happy with [From.GetHerHim], and [From.GetSheHe] seems quite pleased to hear about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_391;Good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_392;I inform [From.GetBestName] that the spirits are happy with [From.GetHerHim], but [From.GetSheHe] does not seem to believe my words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_392;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_393;[From.GetBestName] tells everyone at the Ssitgim-gut that the spirits are mostly indifferent towards me and my conduct, and that they do not care one way or another about the Ssitgim-gut.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_393;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_393;This can't be right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_394;I tell [From.GetBestName] and everyone else at the Ssitgim-gut that the spirits are mostly indifferent, and while [From.GetSheHe] does not seem displeased [From.GetSheHe] also does not look happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_394;I suppose that's to be expected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_395;I tell [From.GetBestName] and everyone else at the Ssitgim-gut that the spirits are mostly indifferent, but it seems as if my words are not believed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_395;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_396;My Court Mu, [From.GetBestName], informs me that the spirits are quite unhappy, and that the Ssitgim-gut barely has been sufficient to placate them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_396;That's bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_396;I don't believe it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_397;I tell [From.GetBestName] that the spirits barely have been placated by the Ssitgim-gut since they were quite unhappy to begin with, and [From.GetSheHe] does not look happy even if [From.GetSheHe] does not contradict me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_397;I think that went well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_398;I tell [From.GetBestName] that the spirits barely have been placated by the Ssitgim-gut since they were quite unhappy to begin with, but [From.GetSheHe] does not look as if [From.GetSheHe] believes a word of what I am saying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_398;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_399;My Court Mu speaks of how one of the spirits that have been present during the Ssitgim-gut is very angry with someone present, someone that has killed kin. I am fairly certain [From.GetBestName] is speaking about me, as I am known to be a kinslayer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_399;I will become a better person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_399;You had it coming!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_400;I let everyone at the Ssitgim-gut know that one of the spirits present is very angry with a kinslayer, and [From.GetBestName] seems as if [From.GetSheHe] regrets [From.GetHerHis] past actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_400;I suppose that's good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_401;I let everyone at the Ssitgim-gut know that one of the spirits present is very angry with a kinslayer. As I finish speaking [From.GetBestName] calls out that there are some that deserve to die even if they are kin, and that the spirit really had it coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_401;Well, that's unexpected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_402;[From.GetBestName] tells everyone at the Ssitgim-gut that there is a spirit present that was killed by close kin but that has come to forgive the kinslayer. I am quite convinced that I am the kinslayer that has been forgiven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_402;I am glad to hear that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_403;I inform everyone at the Ssitgim-gut about one of the spirits being willing to forgive a kinslayer that is present, and [From.GetBestName] really seems relieved to hear my words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_403;Hardly a surprise...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_405;The Gut has come to an end, and regardless of whether everything went well or not it is time to do other things. I rather expect there to be work that requires my attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_405;I should consider another Gut in the future...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_406;I finish up the Gut and the people in the audience start to depart. Regardless of how I feel things went, it is time to do other things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_406;That's all for now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
