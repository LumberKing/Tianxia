EVTDESC_SOH_6602;It would not be a proper Lunar New Year celebration without a dragon dance happening during it. Of course, there are different opinions as to just how many dragons there should be, and I will need to make a decision about that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6602;I want the smallest dragon possible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6602;Get me a regular-sized dragon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_6602;Two dragons are better than one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_6602;I want the full nine dragons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6603;While part of the Lunar New Year celebration will be private and only feature me and my highborn guests, doing something extra to entertain the townspeople might not be a bad idea. I could hire some musicians to do just that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6603;That seems like a good idea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6603;I would rather save the money;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6604;Hiring some acrobats to entertain me and my guests might help spice up the Lunar New Year celebration. Of course, they are not considered as essential as some other parts of the festivities, so I could decide against them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6604;Acrobats? Sign me up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6604;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6605;Much like the dragon dance, fireworks are considered essential during the Lunar New Year celebration. The amount of fireworks that would be proper is hard to determine, and it mainly comes down to how much money the host wishes to spend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6605;I don't want to spend a lot...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6605;I can afford a decent amount!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_6605;I will aim for a few extra...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_6605;I want as many as possible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6606;In addition to the dragon dance it is possible to also hire some entertainers to perform a lion dance. This is generally consdiered less important, but it could still make the celebration of the Lunar New Year more memorable for my guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6606;I want there to be lion dances!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6606;I'd rather save the money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6607;In order for the Lunar New Year celebration to be as good as possible it might be a good idea to invest in decorations. However, considering all the other expenses it is perhaps something I could spend less on, if I so desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6607;I should save the money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6607;Some decorations would be nice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_6607;I want a lot of decorations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6608;While it is not a tradition that is practiced everywhere there are those that hand out red envelopes filled with money during the Lunar New Year without either the giver or the recipient knowing which guest gets which package. Perhaps I should consider doing this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6608;Yes! Let's do that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6608;I have no intention to give away my money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6609;With most of the preparations out of the way I need to decide on how much food I wish to serve my guests during the Lunar New Year celebration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6610;As nearly everything has been prepared it is high time to send out invitations for the guests. It is only right and proper for all of my vassals to be invited.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6611;[Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing], I hereby invite you to my Lunar New Year celebration. Let us welcome the Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac] together!\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6611;I'll be there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6611;As if I would attend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6612;My liege, I have no intention to take part in your Lunar New Year celebration. I have more important matters to attend to.\n\nBy my hand and seal,[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6613;It is customary to ensure tha your home is cleaned before the Lunar New Year to ensure good luck, and I should probably consider making sure that that is seen to. However, with all the rest of the preparations I have made, perhaps I could be excused for not cleaning properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6613;Everything must be properly cleaned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6613;I'll have someone clean a little...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_6613;A little dirt never hurt anyone...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_6614;In the Light of Red Lanters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6614;[Root.Capital.GetName] is in a festive mood as the Year of the [Root.GetOldElement] [Root.GetOldZodiac] is coming to an end and the Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac] is about to begin. The townspeople are out in the streets, dancing, drinking, and laughing, with performers on nearly every street corner.\n\nDespite the celebration of the Lunar New Year only just beginning the sky is still lit by the occasional firework as the more eager -- or perhaps the more drunken -- celebrants see no need to wait.\n\nThe guests have started to arrive, coming from far and wide, and I am certain that my servants soon will have their hands full with their demands. As far as I can tell, everything is in readiness,. I should probably feel free to relax and join the festivities, as long as I remember to greet my guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6614;Wishing you prosperity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_6615;In the Light of Red Lanters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6615;[From.Capital.GetName] is in a festive mood as the Year of the [Root.GetOldElement] [Root.GetOldZodiac] is coming to an end and the Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac] is about to begin.

[From.GetSheHe] exclaims, though it is hard to be sure if it is only due to tradition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6615;Wishing you prosperity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6615;May you live in interesting times!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_6615;Happy New Year!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6616;It is considered a good start to the new year if your home is clean, and [From.GetBestName] has certainly made sure that [From.GetHerHis] home is clean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6616;How auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6616;I don't really care...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6617;It seems [From.GetBestName] has taken note of how clean my home is, as [From.GetSheHe] has been overheard expressing [From.GetHerHis] approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6617;I'm glad you like it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6618;It is considered a good start to the new year if your home is clean, but [From.GetBestName] does not seem to have bothered with it. I have noticed a good amount of dirt in several places inside the rooms that have been set aside for me and my fellow guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6618;How inauspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6618;I've seen worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6619;It seems the cleaning that was done prior to the celebrations was insufficient. Some of my servants have reported that [From.GetBestName] has been heard complaining about it. Perhaps it would have been wise to have made more of an effort to clean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6619;I didn't think anyone would notice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6620;While it is possible to miss some dirt while cleaning it is clear to me that [From.GetBestName] has not even tried to give [From.GetHerHis] home a proper cleaning before the Lunar New Year celebration began.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6620;Most inauspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6620;It would be rude to complain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6621;Though I suspected that there might be disparaging comments directed at my servants due to the lack of cleaning I was quite surprised by [From.GetBestName] going so far as to loudly complain about it and to put the blame on me alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6621;Perhaps I should have made more of an effort...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6622;I had noticed that some parts of [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s home were a bit less clean than expected, but it is not until [From.GetBestName] publicly accuses [FromFrom.GetBestName] of not bothering to clean at all that I come to realize the true extent of the uncleanliness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6622;Most inauspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6623;[From.GetBestName] has clearly invested a lot of money into making sure that the food at the Lunar New Year celebration is anything but sparse. I barely have time to finish my second dessert before a servant comes around and offers me a third.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6623;This is most agreeable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6623;This is incredibly wasteful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_6623;Does it really matter?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6624;The food at [From.GetBestName]'s Lunar New Year celebration is filling and not bland, but it is still rather unremarkable compared to what I have had during other celebrations. A servant lets me know that there will only be a single dessert, not two or more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6625;While there is food to be found at [From.GetBestName]'s Lunar New Year celebration it is clear that there has not been a lot invested into it, as the portions are quite small and the taste is bland. There is not even a single dessert, to my great surprise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6626;It seems the choice of food at my Lunar New Year celebration pleased [From.GetBestName] as [From.GetSheHe] has been heard asking the servants to pass along [From.GetHerHis] compliments to the kitchens and a request for some recipes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6626;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6627;Apparently the food at my Lunar New Year celebration was not to everyone's liking. [From.GetBestName] has been complaining about it throughout the evening, even going as far as to suggest that I do not know how to hire a proper kitchen staff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6627;Cease your complaining!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6628;[From.Capital.GetName] is extensively decorated for the Lunar New Year celebration, and it is clear that [From.GetBestName] has spared no expense to make certain that it is aesthetically pleasing. Clearly, [From.GetSheHe] has a good grasp of Feng Shui, or perhaps the sense to pay someone that is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6628;How auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6628;That's rather unremarkable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6629;It seems [From.GetBestName] approves of the decorations for my Lunar New Year celebration as [From.GetSheHe] just complimented my taste and my grasp of Feng Shui. Though it was not inexpensive, the investment seems to have paid off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6629;I'm glad you approve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6630;When looking at the decorations for the Lunar New celebration in [From.Capital.GetName] I realize that they are rather poor and that their placement leaves a lot to be desired. It is as if [From.GetBestName] never has heard of the concept of Feng Shui.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6630;How inauspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6630;It isn't that bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6631;My choice of decorations for the Lunar New Year celebration apparently leave something to be desired as far as [From.GetBestName] is concerned. In fact, [From.GetSheHe] has been overheard suggesting that I have never heard of Feng Shui.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6631;Shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6632;Though the Lunar New Year celebration in [Root.Capital.GetName] is the perfect opportunity for me to relax it is also an opportunity for learning. My grasp of stewardship is not that great, but I know that [lny_stewardship_teacher.GetName] has some skill in that area. Perhaps I should ask [lny_stewardship_teacher.GetHerHim] for a lesson?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6632;It wouldn't hurt to ask...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6632;Let's not bother [lny_stewardship_teacher.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6633;MY liege, [From.GetBestName], approaches me in private during the Lunar New Year celebration to ask if I would consider giving [From.GetHerHim] a quick lesson concerning matters of stewardship, as [From.GetSheHe] has heard that I am well versed in the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6633;I would be happy to help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6633;I'd rather take it easy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_6633;I'll teach [From.GetHerHim] a lesson, to be sure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6634;[From.GetBestName] was open to giving me a few quick pointers regarding matters of stewardship, and I find that I have a somewhat better grasp of the subject after the lesson, which surely will be a benefit during the Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6634;This is to my liking!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6635;It seems [From.GetBestName] would prefer to relax during the Lunar New Year celebration as [From.GetSheHe] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] would prefer not to give any lessons on the subject of stewardship for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6635;Not what I wanted to hear...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6636;I am quite pleased to hear that [From.GetBestName] is willing to teach me a lesson and leave the meeting certain that I will be able to use what [From.GetSheHe] taught me. Unfortunately, I quickly discover that [From.GetBestName]'s advice was very poor, quite possibly intentionally so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6636;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6637;Though the Lunar New Year celebration in [From.Capital.GetName] is a perfect opportunity for me to relax it is also an opportunity for learning. My grasp of stewardship is not that great, but I know that [lny_stewardship_teacher.GetName] has some skill in that area. Perhaps I should ask [lny_stewardship_teacher.GetHerHim] for a lesson?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_6638;[From.GetBestName] approaches me in private during the Lunar New Year celebration to ask if I would consider giving [From.GetHerHim] a quick lesson concerning matters of stewardship, as [From.GetSheHe] has heard that I am well versed in the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SOH_6638;I'd rather take it easy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_6639;[From.GetBestName] was open to giving me a few quick pointers regarding matters of stewardship, and I find that I have a somewhat better grasp of the subject after the lesson, which surely will be a benefit during the Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6639;This is to my liking!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6640;It seems [From.GetBestName] would prefer to relax during the Lunar New Year celebration as [From.GetSheHe] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] would prefer not to give any lessons on the subject of stewardship for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6640;Not what I wanted to hear...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6641;I am quite pleased to hear that [From.GetBestName] is willing to teach me a lesson and leave the meeting certain that I will be able to use what [From.GetSheHe] taught me. Unfortunately, I quickly discover that [From.GetBestName]'s advice was very poor, quite possibly intentionally so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6641;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6642;As the celebration of the Lunar New Year gets underway one of my servants comes to me with a message from a [Root.Religion.GetName] shrine in [Root.Capital.GetName]. It seems the keepers of the shrine have heard of the celebration and are wishing me a most prosperous Year of the [Root.GetNewZodiac].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6642;Auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_6643;[Root.GetSonDaughterCap] of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6643;I have seen many Lunar New Year celebrations since my birth during the Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac]. Though there have been years when the zodiac or the element has been the same as during year of my birth, the same combination only happens once every sixty years.\n\nAs the Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac] is about to begin once more I receive word from several shrines in [Root.Capital.GetName] that they wish me a most prosperous new year and that they hope that I will live long enough to experience yet another full cycle of years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6643;Most auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_6644;[From.GetSonDaughterCap] of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6644;[From.GetBestName] was born many years ago during the Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac], and that same alignment is once more taking place, which only happens every sixty years. It does not surprise me to hear that congratulations have been sent from some shrines in [From.Capital.GetName], along with wishes of prosperity for [From.GetBestName].\n\nSeveral of the guests at the Lunar New Year celebration are quick to add their own well-wishes to those from the shrine, and it makes sense for me to add my own to theirs as this is a special occasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6644;Wishing you prosperity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6646;It seems the musicians I hired to entertain the townspeople in [Root.Capital.GetName] during the Lunar New Year celebration were not as good as they claimed that they were. Their instruments are poorly tuned and the singers are frequently off-key and sometimes mess up the lyrics, with the result being highly unpleasant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6646;I want my money back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6647;The musicians I hired for the Lunar New Year celebration have apparently performed above and beyond what could be expected of them as I am informed that the townspeople are speaking especially highly of me after the performance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6647;Just as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6648;Though I arranged for some musicians to entertain the townspeople in [Root.Capital.GetName] before the Lunar New Year celebration started they have failed to show up. Upon further investigation it seems they have decided to take my money and depart for places unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6648;Thieves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6649;The acrobats at [From.GetBestName]'s Lunar New Year celebration are quite skilled at their job and I find myself watching the show with with interest, which is replaced with disappointment when I realize that the show is coming to an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6649;Please stay a while longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6649;I've seen better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6650;It seems [From.GetBestName] really enjoyed watching the acrobats I hired for my Lunar New Year celebration as [From.GetSheHe] could be heard asking them to stick around a while longer when they were about to leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6650;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6651;The acrobats I hired put on a good show for me and my guests and took their leave quickly once it was over. Shortly thereafter the captain of my guards came to me to inform you that someone had entered my quarters through the window and stolen some valuables. It does not take me long to realize that the acrobats probably did it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6651;Thieves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6652;As I head elsewhere after watching the acrobats at [From.GetBestName]'s Lunar New Year celebration I find one of them approaching me. At first I fear an attack, but instead the man merely speaks, suggesting that I should distract [lny_burglar_target.GetBestName] so that the acrobats can steal from [lny_burglar_target.GetHerHim]. I am promised a reward for my trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6652;Sounds like a plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6652;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6653;I return to my quarters after having watched the acrobats but barely have time to arrive before I am told that [From.GetBestName] wishes to see me. After speaking to [From.GetHerHim] regarding a trivial matter I venture back into my chambers only to realize that someone has broken into them and stolen some valuables.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6653;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6654;The man that approached me asking for me to distract [lny_burglar_target.GetBestName] comes to find me later in the evening, a smile on his face.\n\n"My [Root.GetLordLady], your distraction was most excellent! As promised, here is your share of the spoils." The man hands over some coins and then disappears into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6654;A job well done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6655;I am on my way back to my quarters when [From.GetBestName] comes running up to me asking to speak to me. It turns out that the discussion is about various trivialties and I start looking for an excuse to leave when one of the guards I brought with me to the celebration comes running to inform me that someone attempted to enter my room but was chased off by the guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6655;I wonder who sent them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6656;As I am conversing with [lny_burglar_target.GetBestName] with the intention of keeping [lny_burglar_target.GetHerHim] away from [From.GetHerHis] quarters one of [From.GetHerHis] guards comes running and informs [From.GetHerHim] that some burglars were chased off. Apparently my distraction was insufficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6656;At least they got away...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6657;As I return to my quarters I hear the sound of someone falling in through the window. I quickly summon my guards, and they manage to catch one of the acrobats from the Lunar New Year celebration before he can escape. The man is swiftly interrogated to reveal the identity of any co-conspirators.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6657;He was working with [From.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6658;I am pondering how best to distract [lny_burglar_target.GetBestName] when one of my servants comes to find me. Apparently the acrobats got impatient and one of their number entered [lny_burglar_target.GetBestName]'s quarters without waiting for the distraction. Even worse, the man got caught and divulged my name when questioned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6658;I had nothing to do with it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6659;Shortly after the acrobats are done with their performance at the Lunar New Year celebration I learn that some of them attempted to break into the quarters of [lny_burglar_target.GetBestName] but got caught once inside. Apparently the man divulged the name of [From.GetBestName] as a possible co-conspirator, though [From.GetSheHe] claims to be innocent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6659;I'm not sure who to trust...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6660;One of the acrobats at the Lunar New Year celebration is rather fetching. She seems to have quite a few admirers in the crowd, even if she does not seem to have much interest in them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6660;I should not bother her...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6660;I should proposition her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6661;I and [pretty_acrobat.GetBestName] sneak away from the crowds and find a seclueded area where we can get to know one another much more intimately. A while later, as we're getting dressed again, she asks me what I think the future holds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6661;I doubt we'll ever meet again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6661;You're welcome to stay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_6661;You should be my concubine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6662;[pretty_acrobat.GetBestName] does not seem particularly interested in me when I attempt to gain her attention, and when I finally manage to get my suggestion across she quickly makes it abundantly clear that she is not interested in me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6662;You don't know what you're missing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6663;One of the acrobats at the Lunar New Year celebration is rather fetching. He seems to have quite a few admirers in the crowd, even if he does not seem to have much interest in them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_6664;I doubt we'll ever meet again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6664;You're welcome to stay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_6664;You should be my consort!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6665;[pretty_acrobat.GetBestName] does not seem particularly interested in me when I attempt to gain his attention, and when I finally manage to get my suggestion across he quickly makes it abundantly clear that he is not interested in me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6665;You don't know what you're missing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6666;While it is a less important part of the Lunar New Year celebration than the dragon dance I had still been looking forward to seeing a lion dance. However, when asking when the lion dancers might show up I am informed that there apparently will not be any at this particular Lunar New Year celebration in [From.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6666;I'll complain to [From.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6666;It is not that important...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6667;It turns out my choice not to hire some lion dance troupes was not entirely a popular one, as [From.GetBestName] comes up to me to voice [From.GetHerHis] displeasure over the fact that there will not be any at my Lunar New Year celebration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6667;You can't please everyone...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6668;As is customary when there are lion dance troupes at a Lunar New Year celebration there is lettuce hung fifteen or more feet above the ground in various places in [From.Capital.GetName] for the lion dancers to try to reach. At one point during the celebrations I see two different lions aproaching the same lettuce, making ready to fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6668;I'll place a bet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6668;I'd rather not gamble...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6669;The two lion dance troupes square off in ritual combat over the lettuce under my watchful gaze. It is a close fight, and for a moment I think the lion I am betting on will be the loser, but then the battle quickly turns in its favour and the troupe in question is given the right to the lettuce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6669;I know a winner when I see them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6670;The two lion dance troupes square off in ritual combat over the lettuce under my watchful gaze. It is a close fight, and for a moment I think the lion I am betting on will be the winner, but then the battle quickly turns against it and it is forced to withdraw while the other lion gets the lettuce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6670;That was unfortunate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6671;It seems some of the lion dance troupes at the Lunar New Year celebration have decided to try something a bit different as they have erected several tall poles holding small circular platforms for them to perform on. However, as the performance is about to begin there are a few troupes that find themselves a person short.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6671;I can fill in for one person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6671;I'd rather watch...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6672;I take the place of one of the missing lion dancers and the performance begins. Though it is not something I am accustomed to I find myself getting the hang of what I am supposed to be doing easily enough, and towards the end my lion is declared the winner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6672;Victory is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6673;I take the place of one of the missing lion dancers and the performance begins. It is not something I am familiar with, and I struggle a bit before getting the hang of it. Though I later hear that my performance was adequate I find that another lion was declared the winner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6673;I suppose I shouldn't be surprised...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6674;I take the place of one of the missing lion dancers and the performance begins. It is not something I am familiar with, and I struggle a bit before I think I have gotten the hang of it. However, it turns out I am mistaken and I am sent tumbling to the ground, injuring myself in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6674;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6675;I take the place of one of the missing lion dancers and the performance begins. It is extremely unfamiliar, and I struggle valiantly to perform. One misstep is all it takes for ne to fall off the platform I was standing on, dragging the other dancer with me and injuring myself quite severely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6675;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6676;[From.GetTitledName] has seen fit to give a red envelope to each guest at [From.GetHerHis] Lunar New Year celebration, containing an unknown amount of money. To my displeasure I discover that there is no money at all to be found in the envelope I was given.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6676;Nothing? Really?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6677;[From.GetTitledName] has seen fit to give a red envelope to each guest at [From.GetHerHis] Lunar New Year celebration, containing an unknown amount of money. To my displeasure I discover that the sum of money in my envelope was miniscule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_6678;[From.GetTitledName] has seen fit to give a red envelope to each guest at [From.GetHerHis] Lunar New Year celebration, containing an unknown amount of money. MY envelope does not contain a large amount of money, but at least it could have been worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_6679;[From.GetTitledName] has seen fit to give a red envelope to each guest at [From.GetHerHis] Lunar New Year celebration, containing an unknown amount of money. I discover that my envelope contains far more money than expected once I have opened it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6679;I think I got lucky!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6680;Though the Lunar New Year celebration in [Root.Capital.GetName] is a perfect opportunity for me to relax it is also an opportunity for learning. My grasp of learning is not that great, but I know that [lny_learning_teacher.GetName] has some skill in that area. Perhaps I should ask [lny_learning_teacher.GetHerHim] for a lesson?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6680;It wouldn't hurt to ask...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_6681;My liege, [From.GetBestName], approaches me in private during the Lunar New Year celebration to ask if I would consider giving [From.GetHerHim] a quick lesson concerning matters of learning, as [From.GetSheHe] has heard that I am well versed in the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6681;I would be happy to help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_6683;It seems [From.GetBestName] would prefer to relax during the Lunar New Year celebration as [From.GetSheHe] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] would prefer not to give any lessons on the subject of learning for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6683;Not what I wanted to hear...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6684;I am quite pleased to hear that [From.GetBestName] is willing to teach me a lesson and leave the meeting certain that I will be able to use what [From.GetSheHe] taught me.

EVTDESC_SOH_6691;With some Lunar New Year celebrations coming under attack from a dragon in the past, it might be prudent to consider whether some more guards would be in order.

EVTOPTA_SOH_6733;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6734;It quickly becomes clear that I stand no chance against the dragon, and she inflects several wounds on me before long.\n\n"I shall spare your life this time, despite your attack on me," she suddenly says, inflicting one final wound before leaping into the air quite gracefully.

EVTOPTA_SOH_6734;At least I am alive...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_6736;I hear the sound of alarm bells ringing and behold a silvery dragon with two large wings and a body that certainly cannot be described as serpentine coming towards the Lunar New Year celebration, landing quite gracefully near where you are standing.\n\n"I am Icava, the Champion of Justice," the dragon says, the voice feminine. "I have no quarrel with you, [Root.GetBestName]. Instead, I seek a great evil."

EVTDESC_SOH_6739;The battle is a close thing, but eventually I seem to be getting the upper hand and start driving the dragon back.\n\n"It seems I shall have to choose the better part of valor," she suddenly says, leaping into the air quite gracefully.

EVTOPTA_SOH_6740;Perhaps the dragon was mistaken?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6741;It quickly becomes apparent that the dragon is more powerful than I am and she easily inflicts several heavy wounds on me.\n\n"For crimes such as yours, there can be no forgiveness," she suddenly says, lunging forward and inflicting a mortal wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_6743;I hear the sound of alarm bells ringing and fear an attack of some kind on the Lunar New Year celebration, but instead a silvery dragon with two large wings approaches the celebration and lands nearby in a very graceful manner.\n\n"I am Icava, the Champion of Justice," the dragon says, the voice feminine. "[Root.GetBestName], with the evil dragon Fredak, the so-called 'Emperor of Embers', I fear for the safety of those as virtuous as you."

EVTDESC_SOH_6790;The two troupes of dragon dancers at the Lunar New Year celebration in [Root.Capital.GetName] are quite skilled, and I rather enjoy the sight of the two dragons as they dance both separately and intertwined throughout the celebrations, with the troupes skillfully avoiding having the dragons get tangled up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_6792;One troupe of dragon dancers is to be expected at a Lunar New Year celebration. Two troupe is much rarer, and even rarer is a dragon dance featuring the full nine dragons, but the dancers in [Root.Capital.GetName] are skilled enough to pull it off.\n\nSome of them separate from the rest every now and then to head out on their own to make sure that as many people as possible get to see a dragon dance, but they sooner or later come back to where I am standing and dance with the rest of the dragons, both separately and intertwined in a manner that only the best troupes are capable of pulling off without the dragons getting tangled up with one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_6794;The dragon dance in [Root.Capital.GetName] is rather pleasant to look at, but as I am watching it some of the dragon dancers suddenly draw weapons and run into the crowd, dragging several important townspeople into a building while shouting various contradictory demands that have to be met before the hostages are released.\n\nOne of my guards brings ne a young woman named [a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName], who drops to her knees before speaking.\n\n"My [Root.GetLordLady], I know how to safely get your guards into that building to rescue the hostages," she says. "Please, put me in charge of the rescue mission.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6794;I trust you to handle this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_6795;The dragon dance in [From.Capital.GetName] is rather pleasant to look at, but as I am watching it some of the dragon dancers suddenly draw weapons and run into the crowd, dragging several important townspeople into a building while shouting various contradictory demands that have to be met before the hostages are released.\n\n[From.GetBestName] suddenly calls for volunteers to go on a rescue mission under the command of [a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName], a young girl who apparently has managed to convince [From.GetBestName] that she is the right person to handle the hostage situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6795;I'll help her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6795;Help a peasant girl? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_6795;I'd rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_6796;A Girl Worth Fighting Alongside;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6796;[a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName] leads my guards and some volunteers from among my guests into the building the bandits took the hostages to through a passageway through the cellar from an adjacent building. She and the others come out through the main entrance with all of the hostages and with several captured bandits a short while later, with several people praising her for her quick thinking and how well she fought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6796;I knew she could do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_6797;A Girl Worth Fighting Alongside;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6797;[a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName] leads me, my fellow volunteers, and some guards into the building to which the hostages were taken through a secret passage leading into the cellar. We fight your way up floor by floor, with the young woman decisively leading us to victory, killing several of the bandits when they are foolish enough to stand in her way. By the time that we the building nobody has anything but praise for her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6797;With you on our side, victory is certain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_6798;A Girl Worth Fighting Alongside;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6798;I wait with [From.GetBestName] and the others that did not choose to go with [a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName] as she enters the building leading a small group of guards and volunteers. Sounds of fighting soom can be heard from the building the bandits entered, and before long [a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName] comes out through the main entrance with all the hostages accounted for and everyone who fought at her side praising her and her skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6798;That worked?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_6799;A Girl Not Worth Fighting Alongside;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6799;[a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName] enters the building the bandits took the hostages to with some guards and volunteers. I hear fighting going on inside the building for a while and hope for good news, but soon [a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName] and some of the volunteers can be seen jumping out the windows to the relative safety outside. By the time that the guards get inside the hostages are all dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6799;She has failed me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_6800;A Girl Not Worth Fighting Alongside;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6800;[a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName] enters the building the bandits took the hostages to with me and some others following her. We immediately encounter fierce resistance, with several guards dying before we clear the first room. The resistance does not let up, and soon we are all forced to jump out the nearest window to escape. You later learn that most of the bandits got away and that none of the hostages survived.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6800;It was her fault!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_6801;A Girl Not Worth Fighting Alongside;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6801;I watch as [a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName] leads the guards and the volunteers inside the building the bandits entered with their hostages and wonder how well it will go. I soon have my answer as [a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName] and various other people are forced to escape through the windows, and when the guards finally manage to get into the building they discover that all of the hostages were found dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6801;Hardly surprising!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6802;Though I feared that my guards might not be able to handle the bandits well enough to ensure that they all got killed or captured and also feared that they might not be able to save the hostages I am pleased to learn that they are up to the task. It seems [a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName]'s assistance was not something I needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6802;The guards handled it well;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6803;Fireworks are an expected part of the Lunar New Year celebration, and [From.GetTitledName] has prepared a few that are fired off during the celebration. They are not particularly impressive, as even some of the townsfolk in [From.Capital.GetName] seem to have managed to outdo the display with ease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6803;Most inauspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6803;I'd rather not complain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6804;It seems [From.GetTitledName] did not enjoy the fireworks at my Lunar New Year celebration as [From.GetSheHe] can be heard complaining loudly. Even worse, my other guests soon start voicing their own complaints, suggesting that I have a poor grasp of what is right and proper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6804;Perhaps I should have gotten more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6805;The fireworks at [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s are not particularly impressive, and when [From.GetTitledName] decides to complain about it I see fit to follow suit. After all, even some of the townspeople in [FromFrom.Capital.GetName] seem to have managed to outdo [From.GetTitledName] with ease, judging by other fireworks nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6805;Most inauspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6806;The fireworks I bought for my Lunar New Year celebration are perhaps not as impressive as they could have been if I had decided to invest some more money, but they are certainly more than adequate, and I find myself enjoying them quite a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6806;That was rather nice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6807;The fireworks at [From.GetBestName]'s Lunar New Year celebration are perhaps not as impressive as they could have been if [From.GetSheHe] had decided to invest some more money, but they are certainly more than adequate, and I find myself enjoying them quite a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6807;That was rather nice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6808;As my Lunar New Year celebration nears its end the fireworks I bought are lit and the sky comes alight thanks to the multi-colored sparks released by the fireworks. The Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac] is beginning in style.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6808;Auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6809;As [From.GetBestName]'s Lunar New Year celebration nears its end a large number of fireworks are lit and the sky comes alight thanks to the multi-colored sparks released by the fireworks. The Year of the [From.GetNewElement] [From.GetNewZodiac] is beginning in style.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6809;Auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_6810;The Grand Fireworks Display;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6810;The sky is lit by colorful explosions as the fireworks I bought for the Lunar New Year celebration are lit to celebrate the end of the Year of the [Root.GetOldElement] [Root.GetOldZodiac] and the start of the Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac]. Some of the townsfolk are lighting their own fireworks, but they are insignificant next to mine.\n\nI watch the show with a smile on your lips, satisfied with the knowledge that there should be no reason for anyone to complain about the fireworks due to the magnificience of the display.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Some of the townsfolk are lighting their own fireworks, but they are barely worthy of the name.\n\nI have heard of firework displays that could compete with the one you are witnessing in perhaps one or two other places, but even if they could, there is no denying [From.GetBestName]'s fireworks are magnificient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_6812;The Lunar New Year celebration has come to an end, and with it the Year of the [Root.GetOldElement] [Root.GetOldZodiac]. The Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac] has begun, and it is time to tend to other matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
