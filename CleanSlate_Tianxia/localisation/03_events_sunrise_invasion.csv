EVTTITLE_SRI_2;Lost at Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_2;A wealthy Chinese merchant by the name of Ma He recently left Guangzhou with a large fleet of ships, sailing in the direction of the Ma-i-an Archipelago on what should have been a fairly ordinary voyage. However, rumor has it that he has yet to arrive in the archipelago, and where the merchant's fleet has ended up is unclear.\n\nA few sailors aboard other ships that recently have returned from the archipelago have claimed that they witnessed a large number of ship heading further east, directly towards a brewing storm, though many suspect that they simply are telling tall tales in the hopes of getting free drinks at whichever tavern they are visiting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_2;These things happen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SRI_4;The Burning Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_4;Word has reached my court that a small ship with a half-starved crew made landfall in the easternmost reaches of Java recently. The sailors aboard claim to have been part of Ma He's fleet, and that they are all that remain.\n\nAccording to their rather fanciful tale, the fleet crossed the Eastern Ocean and arrived off the coast of a previously unknown continent. There, the fleet supposedly was captured by the forces of the "Lord of the Dawn", the ruler of a vast realm the sailors call the "Burning Empire". If the sailors are to be believed, they are all that remain from a much larger group that made a daring escape, and many ships had to be left behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_4;They have clearly gone mad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SRI_6;Trouble in the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_6;The great archipelago east of Java is known to be home to many savage tribes that have little to offer to the civilized peoples of the world, and thus it is an area that few pay attention to and fewer care to visit.\n\nHowever, unusual rumors have recently started to spread from the achipelago, telling of a great tribe of warriors in enormous ships that supposedly have started attacking the people there, with great success. Where these invaders came from is somewhat unclear, though some whisper that they came across the Eastern Ocean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_6;A fantasy menace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_6;And so it begins...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_8;Today a small ship arrived from the eastern archipelago, bringing with it an emissary claiming to have been charged with negotiate on behalf of a group of refugees due to arrive before long. Apparently, they wish to settle in [papuan_refugee_province.GetName] as their homeland supposedly was conquered by the strangers from the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_8;I suppose I can allow it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_8;There is no place for you here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_9;"We will have to take [papuan_refugee_province.GetName] by force, then!" the emissary declares, turning and taking his leave.\n\nMy courtiers are rather too amused by this bold claim to try to stop the man, and he returns to his ship and sets sail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_9;Empty threats!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_11;A small band of warriors from the eastern archipelago arrived on the shores of [papuan_refugee_province.GetName] today, wasting no time before disembarking and launching an attack on the nearest settlement. Clearly, they could not accept their emissary's failure to secure the land peacefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_11;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_12;Today a small ship bearing what passes for notables from among the people living in the eastern archipelago arrived at my court. They humbly request permission to stay, claiming that they have nowhere else to go as their homeland has been lost to the vast armies of the "Takers of Daughers".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_12;You can stay in my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_12;Be gone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SRI_13;Strangers with Silver;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_13;Several large ships have been making landfall in Japan and in various islands further south, carrying with them official-looking strangers escorted by large numbers of warriors that have come ashore demanding to speak to the local authorities.\n\nI granted an audience to one such group, and their leader formally requested permission to settle in [province_being_bought.GetName] in the future along with some of his countrymen, offering a substantial payment of silver in return. When asked how many settlers they would be bringing, the man claimed that I hardly need to concern myself with such details, repeating the offer of silver for land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_13;I can set aside some land for you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_13;My land is not for sale!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_15;The strange ships have departed, sailing south and east. The envoys did not look pleased when they departed, and some people that were nearby as the strangers boarded their ships claim to have heard one of the strangers say something about the region having to be left to the "Golden Hosts" of the "Lord of the Dawn", whatever that is supposed to mean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_15;I have a bad feeling about this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_16;The strange ships have departed, sailing south and east. The envoys looked rather pleased when they departed, and some people that were nearby claim to have heard one of the strangers say something about there being no need for the "Golden Hosts" of the "Lord of the Dawn" to intervene in the region, whatever that is supposed to mean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_16;What a strange thing to say...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_18;Hundreds of menacing ships have arrived off the shores of [Root.GetName], spilling out numberless hordes of fierce warriors in strange garb. Their ululating battle cries can be heard for miles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_18;Throw them back into the sea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SRI_19;Sunrise Invasion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_19;A mighty fleet consisting of hundreds of warships have arrived off the shores of [From.GetName], bringing one of the seemingly inexhaustable armies of the Sapa Inca with it, which made landfall shortly after dawn while letting out ululating battle cries.\n\nThough the invaders have proven unwilling to negotiate at this point, some of the refugees fleeing before their advance claim that they have proclaimed that they have been tasked with securing the entirety of what they have termed the "Sunset Isles" for their ruler, and unless they are stopped it is likely that their advance will continue even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_19;They must be driven back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_20;Hundreds of menacing ships have arrived off the shores of [Root.GetName], spilling out numberless hordes of fierce warriors in strange garb. Their ululating battle cries can be heard for miles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_20;Throw them back into the sea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SRI_1;Sunrise Invasion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_21;A mighty fleet consisting of hundreds of warships have arrived off the shores of [From.GetName], bringing one of the seemingly inexhaustable armies of the Sapa Inca with it, along with priests and priestesses sworn to their heathen god Inti, whose followers supposedly have been victorious in every war fought in his name.\n\nMany of those who have fled before the invaders claim that their priestesses steal away the daughters of those that submit, supposedly to either be wedded off to foreign lords or sacrificed to the merciless god of the sun for the benefit of the whole empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_21;They must be driven back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_22;Hundreds of menacing ships have arrived off the shores of [Root.GetName], spilling out numberless hordes of fierce warriors in strange garb. Their ululating battle cries can be heard for miles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_SRI_3;Sunrise Invasion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_23;A mighty fleet consisting of hundreds of warships have arrived off the shores of [From.GetName], bringing one of the seemingly inexhaustable armies of the Sapa Inca with it. These warriors have been heard letting out ululating cries and are dressed in strange armor made of painted wood and chequered cloth.\n\nThough the battle still rages, some of those fleeing from the invaders claim that they demand that all adopt their strange customs and their heathen religion, and that the people of the towns that refuse are put to death so that the area can be repopulated with Quechua settlers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_23;They must be driven back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SRI_5;Sunrise Invasion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_25;Knowing of the mightly armies and immense fleets brought to bear by the Incan invaders further south, the rulers of various islands to the north of the Ma-i-an Archipelago have been doing what they can to prepare themselves for a similar onslaught, but it has become clear that they will face a different threat.\n\nInstead of a single mighty host carried by one grand armada, several smaller armies of Inca warriors have made landfall, each of them seemingly operating independently. Those that have managed to flee before the onslaight claim that the invaders have come to claim what they previously purchased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_25;They must be driven back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_26;Hundreds of menacing ships have arrived off the shores of [Root.GetName], spilling out numberless hordes of fierce warriors in strange garb. Their ululating battle cries can be heard for miles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_26;Throw them back into the sea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SRI_7;Sunrise Invasion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_27;A mighty fleet consisting of hundreds of warships have arrived off the shores of [From.GetName], bringing one of the seemingly inexhaustable armies of the Sapa Inca with it, and disproving the claims made by those those that thought that the invaders would not seek to make landfall so far north.\n\nThere is a lot of confusion at the moment, but according to some of the refugees fleeing before the invaders they bring priests and common craftsmen on their ships in addition to their strangely armed and armored warriors, which indicates that the plan is to colonize the region and not just to launch a great raid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_27;They must be driven back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SRI_8;The Inca Meet With Defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_28;The great Inca warhost that crossed the ocean in their mad bid to conquer All Under Heaven has been thrown back into the sea. Their colonies have been lost and their armies vanquished. The pitiful remnants of their invasion force has set sail back towards their homeland of Kay Pacha to lick their wounds and inform the Sapa Inca of their defeat.\n\nThere may come a time when their own shores are visited by fleets from the Old World, and when that happens the debt they have incurred with their former victims will no doubt be collected in full... with interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_28;A reckoning will not be postponed indefinitely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SRI_30;The Emperor's New Clothes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_30;The Inca invaders have come into contact with many things that were unfamiliar to them prior to their arrival since they arrived in Asia, and though some of the things they have become fascinated with would be rather mundane as far as the locals would be concerned a few of the things the invaders have taken a liking to are not qutie as mundane.\n\nOne such thing is silk, which they have seen fit to ship back vast quantities of to their homeland so that the tailors of Cuzco can make good use of it when creating clothes for the Sapa Inca and those in his favor. The resulting clothing is reportedly strange, but beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_30;At least the savage isn't naked...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_30;Their efforts are adequate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SRI_31;The Drink of an Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_31;Though they were hesitant to try it at first, the Inca invaders have acquired a taste for tea since their arrival in Asia, and rumor has it vast tea plantations are being constructed back in their distant homeland to ensure that it always will be available for the children of Inti.\n\nIt is said that the Sapa Inca [Root.GetHerselfHimself] likes to hold elaborate tea ceremonies unlike any seen before when hosting [Root.GetHerHis] favorite courtiers, and that [Root.GetHerHis] most trusted generals often drink copious amounts of tea whenever they meet to discuss the process of forging a lasting empire where the sun never sets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_31;How preposterious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_31;Rule, Tawantinsuyu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SRI_32;The Fall of the Great Jungle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_32;Thanks to the wars they have waged in what they have named the "Sunset Archipelago", the Inca armies have become quite accustomed to jungles. There is, as usual, precious little information from overseas, but from what can be pieced together it seems the Inca have finally pacified their stubborn rivals in the eastern jungle.\n\nThe Tupi Alliance and the Muisca Confedertion have already been incorporated into their growing empire, and Cuzco armies are now marching towards the last hold-outs of the Free Lokono City-States on the far coast. It may only be a matter of time before the entire continent is ruled from the great imperial city of Cuzco.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_32;The same must never happen here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_32;Resistance is futile!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SRI_33;The Sun's Fury;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_33;The Inca have been fascinated with fireworks ever since the first time they encountered them, and their interest in them has often bordered on an obseession. Reportedly, several of their armies have had standing orders to secure as many fireworks as possible during their campaigns.\n\nRumor has it the invaders have been shipping the captured fireworks back to their homeland on a frequent basis, and that they no longer simply use them to entertain the Sapa Inca and the people of Cuzco. Just what they are being used for is unclear, though some truly outlandish tales claim that they will be used to make Inti's enemies feel his fury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_33;As if that will work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_33;The power of the sun... in the palm of my hand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SRI_34;News From Across the Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_34;;Rumors have reached Asia of a titanic struggle taking place across the Great Sea in the homeland of the Inca. The Inca themselves rarely discuss it with outsiders, but it appears they have been locked in a deadly war for some time with the Mexica, a great empire from the jungles far to the north of Cuzco. They are ruled by the Huehuetlatoani, who has allegedly sacrificed untold millions of people to his terrible blood gods.\n\nIf the stories are to be believed, the warriors of the Mexica managed to inflict a crushing defeat on the Sapa Inca's forces through the use of mounted warriors, and the armies of Inti were forced to withdraw further south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_34;These "Blood-Gods" apparently got plenty of blood...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_34;Tenochtitlan was merely a setback!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_35;The Inca armies have secured control over the massive temple of Borobudur, and reports are claiming that the priests of Inti already are making preliminary plans to consecrate it in his name, having declared it one of the holiest sites in the region they have named the "Sunset Archipelago".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_35;They must be stopped!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_35;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_36;The armies of the Sapa Inca now control the entirety of Java, from the Sunda Strait to the Bali Strait, as well as various smaller islands further east. Having determined that the island easily could house a vast population, the invaders have requested that additional settlers be diverted to the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_36;We cannot allow a permanent settlement!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_36;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_37;The coastline of the island of Borneo now belongs to the Inca Empire. Several of the jungle tribes deeper inland still resist the invaders, but word is the invaders are not overly eager to defeat them permanently, seeing the minor skirmishes in the region as an opportunity for young warriors to prove themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_37;Perhaps this will be their undoing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_37;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_38;The cruel Inca invaders are now fully in control of the Ma-i-an Archipelago, and rumor has it they both are fortifying the region and are constructing new settlements to house the many settlers from their homeland, while the priests of Inti supposedly stalk the land to steal away the daughters of the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_38;These brutes must be driven out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_38;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_39;Palembang, once the crown jewel of the Srivijayan Empire, has fallen to the Sapa Inca's hordes. Already work is being carried out to secure the invaders' hold over the city and to throw back any counterattack, and word has it that the many temples of the city are being re-consecrated in the name of Inti.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_39;The city must be liberated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_39;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_40;The Sapa Inca's armies have secured the entirety of Sumatra, along with several smaller islands nearby. Reports claim that they already have had to suppress several small uprisings as some of the rural communities in the region have been even less willing than most to hand over their daughters be indoctrinated by the invaders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_40;Another major loss to the invaders...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_40;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_41;The Inca have now taken over the entirety of the Ryukyuan Archipelago, and express great disdain for their "Three Mountains", which they say pale in comparison to their homeland. They have begun constructing a grand harbour, where every day more and more ships arrive carrying eager warriors seeking to join the invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_41;What will it take to stop them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_41;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_42;Ise now belongs to the Inca Empire, bringing the grand shrine sacred to Amaterasu under their control. The Inca have expressed disdain for the great kami, claiming that she at best is fit to be a consort of Inti, and reports have it that they might be forcing young women formerly serving Amaterasu to instead pledge themselves to Inti.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_42;They truly have no honor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_42;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_43;From the Tsugaru Strait in the north to Tane in the south, Japan is under the Inca yoke. The invaders have found it highly offensive that an area on the western shores of the "Great Western Ocean" is called the "Land of the Rising Sun", and have decreed that the islands must be referred to as the "Land of the Setting Sun".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_43;May their sun set next!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_43;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_44;The Korean Peninsula now belongs to Inti, and reports from the area claim that many Quechua settlers soon will arrive in the area. Though not adverse to using poetic names for a region, the Sapa Inca's officials have seen fit to adapt the traditional name for the region and refer to it as the "Land of the Evening Calm".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_44;May it be anything but calm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_44;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_45;The great city of Angkor is now in the hands of the Sapa Inca, and the great temple complex nearby has also fallen. The priests and priestesses of Inti have already begun preparations to sanctify it to their god, declaring their intention to make it into one of the holiest places outside their distant homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_45;This must not be allowed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_45;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_46;From Arakan to Champa, the land now belongs to the Inca Empire. The officials of the Sapa Inca have ordered the locals to provide workers for extensive construction projects, and the ululating warriors from across the sea have proven quite willing to force compliance whenever someone has seen fit to put up resistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_46;They cannot be allowed to remain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_46;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_47;The Middle Kingdom's heartland has fallen to the warriors of Inti, perhaps signifying that the Sun God has granted them the Mandate of Heaven. The invaders appear to have found many historical texts from the region highly educational, and it is said that their generals have taken a particular interest in the Art of War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_47;That cannot possibly bode well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_47;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_48;The Tibetan Plateau now belongs to the Sapa Inca and Inti. The invaders have expressed great interest in the region, finding it somewhat comparable to their homeland, and plans are being made to construct many temples to Inti on the mountains in the area, which the invaders seem to think are taller than many of those at home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_48;We must force them back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_48;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_49;The entirety of India has fallen to the invaders from beyond te sea, who seem undeterred even in the face of war elephants. Having heard tales of how Alexander the Great turned back shortly after crossing the Indus in the other direction, the invaders have made a sacred vow to truly continue until there is no land left to conquer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_49;When will it end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_49;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
