EVTDESC_SOH_803;[Root.GetBestName],\nI welcome you into the ranks of the Hwarang. I ask that you trust your friends, that you are loyal to your liege and parents, that you do not retreat in battle, and that you never take a life without just cause.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[hwarang_leader.GetSocietyRank] [hwarang_leader.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_803;I will not disappoint you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_806;[hwarang_candidate.GetBestName] has requested to join the Hwarang, stating that [hwarang_candidate.GetSheHe] feels that the guiding principles of the society speak to [hwarang_candidate.GetHerHim] and that [hwarang_candidate.GetSheHe] has what it takes to be a good member.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_806;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_806;Maybe when you are older...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_809;The Hwarang Reborn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_809;[From.GetBestName] has decreed that the Hwarang, an organization of young warriors serving the kings of Silla before Silla's surrender to Goryeo, is to be refounded under [From.GetHerHis] righteous leadership. Though the decree only was made recently, word is already spreading swiftly, and many have expressed an interest in joining the ranks of the reformed Hwarang.\n\nWhile there might be those that doubt that this new organization will prove to be a worthy successor of the Hwarang of old, it is likely that few openly will question [From.GetBestName]'s decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_809;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_809;An auspicious event!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
