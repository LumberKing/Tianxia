General guidelines moving forward:
- Changing the order of traits -- or adding new traits (except if they're added after ALL previous traits in ALL files) -- breaks saves. If you add a trait, make it clear ahead of release so that we can warn people.
- When adding a trait (excepting completely hidden ones), add <trait>_opinion and opinion_of_<trait> in modifier_definitions; sort according to trait file sorting, including base CleanSlate. This makes things easier moving forward
