General guidelines moving forward:
- Reserve ids before you add events.
- Namespaces are nice to use.
- Remember to use practical_age rather than max_age unless a specific year is needed.
- Remember to use is_actually_incapable_trigger rather than is_incapable/only_capable unless it is important to use the latter.
- Remember to use has_actual_regency_trigger rather than has_regent whenever relevant; the Tenno/etc. should get to do a bunch of stuff even with a regent.
- Remember that only_men/only_women might break down with gender equality/Enatic Clans.
- Outside of character creation, add/remove traits using the effects in 00_trait_effects_events if it's a personality trait or similar.
