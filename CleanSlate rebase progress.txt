WORK IN PROGRESS; MOST OF TIANXIA HAS NOT BEEN PORTED!

Massive credits to the CleanSlate team for all of their hard work; credits will be given in Tianxia's main credit list once the resulting work is released.



CleanSlate rebase of Tianxia, part 1:
- Added Tianxia's graphical map files.
- Event offsets set to Tianxia values.
- CleanSlate c_uzen changed to c_uzen_ili; c_uzen is in Japan, as it should be.
- Merged culture groups. Graphical culture types, tag localization TODO.
- Alphabetized male_ and female_names for Tianxia cultures.
- Fixed spacing in Tianxia cultures.
- Cleaned up duplicate names for Tianxia cultures.
- Added seafarer = yes to Tamil culture, because Cholas.
- Added seafarer = yes to Malay, Cham, Javanese culture.
- Added parent = roman to Italian and Sardinian. Potentially worth revisiting.
- Added parent = french to Outremer. Potentially worth revisiting.
- Corrected gross oversight as far as cat names goes; the best feline overlord is now included!
- Corrected "Tiomat" to "Tiamat". She was not amused.
- Commented out some dragon names in the wrong gender namelist. I'm reasonably sure both Deathwing and Bahamut are male.
- Added a few more dragon names.
- Removed dukes_called_kings = yes from some cultures that shouldn't have petty kings.
- Expanded the Japanese (and Wako) male namelist somewhat.
- Updated secondary_event_pictures for a number of cultures to have them fallback to a similar culture first.
- Revised the Batak namelist, removing many names that were clan names (TODO: Add as dynasty names) or otherwise terrible, and adding new ones. Renaming of placeholders TODO.
- Updated vanilla positions to work with Tianxia offsets. Provinces are still wastelands with names like "PROV2485", seeing as titles and history is TODO.
- Linked some more names to ensure regnal numbers work as they should in more cases.
- Updated Malay names and derived names. Renaming of placeholders TODO.
- Updated Javanese names and derived names slightly and fixed history.
- Improved Tagalog and Cebuan namelists. Renaming of Cebuan placeholders TODO.
- Revised Papuan namelist.
- Replaced Dayak and Banjar namelists with slightly less wrong placeholder namelists. Renaming of placeholders TODO.
