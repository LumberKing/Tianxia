- Ported climate setup.
- Ported island region setup.
- Cleaned up CleanSlate geographical regions irrelevant to us; will cause Validator complaints until other files are updated, but it should be fine.
	- Removed the HPFZ; random counties not getting the Black Death "because history" is silly, as opposed to broad regions (e.g. the steppe).
	- Removed the "eastern edge of the map"; it isn't.
	- Removed the "Chinese invasion region"; there are no Chinese invasions in Tianxia.

CleanSlate rebase of Tianxia, part 3:
- Once again fixed c_uzen_itil; c_uzen is still in Japan!
- Merged bloodlines. Text modifiers and their localization TODO.
- Added a bloodline for Niu Sengru; Li Deyu already had one, and that's clearly unfair!
- The Dongnyeong and Ssangseong bloodlines now lower Koreanic opinion. Choe Tan and Jo Hwi know what they did!
- Wu Zetian's bloodline now stands out a bit more due to having a different icon.
- Added a bloodline for the Tenson dynasty.
- Improved bloodline localization.
- Merged traits. Crusader-equivalents TODO.
- Kinslayer traits now hurt Confucian opinion. A Focus on Family Doctrine implementation TODO.

	- Merged landed titles and province history in Heilongjiang.

CleanSlate rebase of Tianxia, part 2:
- Consistency improvements to vanilla's default intermarriage setup:
	- Unreformed-reformed intermarriage is now consistently allowed. Vanilla picking and choosing feels unintentional, seeing as there's no historical justification for either.
	- Made some one-sided intermarriage setups bidirectionally consistent, seeing as the AI never can take advantage of unilateral intermarriage:
		- Unreformed Norse and Finnish now intermarry in both directions, rather than just one direction. Reasoning: It makes about as much sense as either intermarrying with Romuva, which is allowed.
		- Qarmatian marriage restrictions with other Muslims given preference over other Muslims being fine with Qarmatians. Reasoning: It's more interesting than "Everyone can do it!", and Qarmatians were a late addition and have other oversights.
		- Mazdans are now fine with Qarmatians, rather than just Qarmatians being fine with Mazdans. Reasoning: Cross-group intermarriage is generally interesting, and Qarmatians were a late addition and have other oversights.
- Non-consistency changes to vanilla intermarriage setup (i.e. "At least half of this is Tianxia, and we don't want it!"):
	- Nestorians no longer get to intermarry with Taoists (potentially something to revisit), Bön.
	- Bön now only intermarries with Buddhists.
	- Zun and Taoist no longer intermarry.
- Jain are now as aggressive as Peaceful pagans in AI hands; vanilla inconsistency fix.
- Commented out achievement-related on_action events; they're just a waste of performance, and every little bit helps.
- Added culture and culture group localization from Tianxia.
- Added Tianxia graphicalculturetypes for cultures.
- Adjusted Tianxia intermarriages in several places.
- Disabled castes for Buddhists; they certainly didn't use those in large parts of our map.
- Kejawèn now has castes, caste opinions, and heir designation.
- Decided Aztec lack of raiding was a bug; Nahua has it, but any converts should also have it...
- Decided that the Aztecs, by virtue of being advanced enough to cross the Atlantic with an invading army, probably don't frown on tribal organization.
- Decided that the Aztecs are more fun if they're hard to convert.
- Merged Tianxia religions, though with temporary icons for now.
- Set up graphicalculturetypes for Tianxia religions.
- Adjusted name and/or culture of some vanilla Khitan dynasties that looked very suspect.
- Added some missing localization for god names. Placeholders still need work.
- Ported dynasties and improved formatting, religion, excluding very recent additions.

Merged schwarherz's much more intelligent setup of the merge.

CleanSlate rebase of Tianxia, part 1:
- Added Tianxia's graphical map files.
- Event offsets set to Tianxia values.
- CleanSlate c_uzen changed to c_uzen_ili; c_uzen is in Japan, as it should be.

- Alphabetized male_ and female_names for Tianxia cultures.
- Fixed spacing in Tianxia cultures.
- Cleaned up duplicate names for Tianxia cultures.
- Added seafarer = yes to Tamil culture, because Cholas.
- Added seafarer = yes to Malay, Cham, Javanese culture.
- Added parent = roman to Italian and Sardinian. Potentially worth revisiting.
- Added parent = french to Outremer. Potentially worth revisiting.
- Corrected gross oversight as far as cat names goes; the best feline overlord is now included!
- Corrected "Tiomat" to "Tiamat". She was not amused.
- Commented out some dragon names in the wrong gender namelist. I'm reasonably sure both Deathwing and Bahamut are male.
- Added a few more dragon names.
- Removed dukes_called_kings = yes from some cultures that shouldn't have petty kings.
- Expanded the Japanese (and Wako) male namelist somewhat.
- Updated secondary_event_pictures for a number of cultures to have them fallback to a similar culture first.
- Revised the Batak namelist, removing many names that were clan names (TODO: Add as dynasty names) or otherwise terrible, and adding new ones. Renaming of placeholders TODO.
- Updated vanilla positions to work with Tianxia offsets. Provinces are still wastelands with names like "PROV2485", seeing as titles and history is TODO.
- Linked some more names to ensure regnal numbers work as they should in more cases.
- Updated Malay names and derived names. Renaming of placeholders TODO.
- Updated Javanese names and derived names slightly and fixed history.
- Improved Tagalog and Cebuan namelists. Renaming of Cebuan placeholders TODO.
