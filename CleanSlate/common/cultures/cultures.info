# Do not change tags in here without changing every other reference to them.
# If adding new groups or cultures, make sure they are unique.

# Culture-specific opinion can be added to modifiers (E.G., norse_opinion = 5), but the modifier *has* to be defined in 00_modifier_definitions.txt as well. It also needs localisation. Works for groups as well

# Culture modifiers: modifier (applies to provinces), character_modifier, and settlement modifiers.
# The ID of the modifier can be defined here (E.G., modifier = modifier_name or character_modifier = modifier_name), while the effect of it must be defined in static_modifiers.txt, and the localisation in localisation. For the settlement modifiers you don't need to (and can't) define the ID; it defaults to culture name + settlement type. E.G., norse_temple

# nomadic_in_alt_start = yes - Will be Nomadic if the "Tribal & Nomadic" option is taken in the alt-start generation
