 Triggers are in Province scope. The From Scope contains the settlement holder (character) start trigger is in title scope.

For nomad capitals, remember than the tech requirement trigger should be applied to the nomad
(which means it uses the character's primary tech status, i.e. the nomad capital status for nomads, capital province tech status otherwise)
I.e. use the FROM scope for nomad capital buildings.

All cultural buildings follow the same pattern:
	tech required is 0, 1, 2, 4 for the levels of the buildings
	cost is 200 + 100 per level
	60 maintenance of troops + 20 per level
	+ 0.15 bonus in either offensive, defensive or morale sometimes split over different units or stats same on all levels

	Culture building names MUST start with ca_culture

<tag> = {
	desc = description used in the tooltip of the building
	trigger = used for tech requirement of the building, set to 0 if no requirement so it can be build automatically on new games
	gold_cost = cost to build the building
	piety_cost = piety cost to build the building
	prestige_cost = prestige cost to build the building
	Be aware that you can only use one of gold, piety, and prestige cost
	build_time = time to build, in days

	ai_creation_factor = weight that the AI uses to determine what building to build
	extra_tech_building_start = when starting a new game this building will be pre-built if the province has higher tech than the requirement + this + random 0-1
 }
