Alpha 13.0.1 (CVUY) - 24/6/2021
--------------------------------------

Bugfixes:

- You will now be informed of how much Grace the EoC thinks a eunuch is worth when the offer is accepted (in any fashion).
- You will now be informed of how much Grace the EoC thinks a concubine is worth when the offer is accepted (in any fashion).

- Fixed vanilla issue where people would become lovers during seclusion despite having incompatible orientation.

- Fixed some issues with the Grand Chancellor bloodline.
- Lowered the prestige loss for various kinds of Chinese tributaries significantly (now -0.25/-0.5/-0.75/-1 for count/duke (or king-tier nomad)/king (or emperor-tier nomad/emperor, multiplied by tributary tier, with puppets counting as client states), seeing as small realms being completely crippled by tributary relationships wasn't ideal.
- Fixed pagan holy order leaders having the wrong religion, using a fix from CleanSlate (many thanks!).
- Members of the Hwarang that have reflected on a trait should now consider themselves done with that business for real if they succeed or decide to give up.
- Hopefully made it possible for people stuck reflecting on a trait due to not having the modifier cleared out to start over (at the cost of possibly letting someone that's not truly stuck start reflecting on a second trait in old saves).

- Fixed some localization regarding society currency gain for members of the Hwarang and the WotRS.
- Minor localization improvements and fixes.
- The player should now be informed of Fredak's first appearance with a narrative event even when the AI picks the "Please burninate my capital with extreme prejudice!" option (which the AI almost always picks the first time).
- Fixed troops located in the Bagan province appearing to be standing in the Ava province, hopefully causing fewer military blunders in the region.
- Fixed several issues with Pragmatist Council Eunuchs opposing or supporting title grants and revokations when they should be doing the opposite.

Balance:
- Made Righteous Armies a bit more expensive.
- Made Righteous Armies have a somewhat worse troop composition (and sligthly fewer troops).
- Lowered the AI aggression of some Tianxia pagans a bit.
- The Tenno should no longer consider factioning for someone else under any circumstances.
- The Tenno should no longer be able to push his dynasty members' claims on empires (he can still press his own, but he will forfeit any secondary empires he might gain (and will prefer keeping e_japan over any other empire)).
- The Permanent Regent should now be reluctant to put someone that's landed on the Chrysanthemum Throne, particularly someone that's got an impressive title.

- Added factions for installing Permanent Regents for the Tenno and Shinto/Japonic Buddhist emperors that are feudal and aren't Chinese Imperial.

- Moved some of the holy sites for the Taoist, Shenist, Muist, Thanist, Ryukyuan, Melanesian, Kaharingan, and Sanamahist religions.
- Gave Mandate of Heaven revolters access to the Chinese Reconquest and Chinese Subjugation CBs if they win their revolt.
