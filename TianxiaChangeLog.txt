Beta 14.0.1 - 29/01/2024
--------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: Tianxia has now been rebased off of CleanSlate; CleanSlate 1.0 Beta 6.1 [EZKM] (https://github.com/ck2plus/CleanSlate/releases/tag/1.0-beta6.1) MUST be active for Tianxia to run.
IMPORTANT: Any old Tianxia.mod file MUST be replaced with the new one; the new version contains important changes, such as actually setting up CleanSlate as a dependency.
IMPORTANT: Delete any old Tianxia directory; don't just overwrite it with the new one.
IMPORTANT: Pre-14.0.0 saves will not work, 14.0.0 saves are likely to experience some oddities; starting a new game would be advisable.
IMPORTANT: Random/Shattered world and the EU4 Converter are not supported.
IMPORTANT: Start dates after 1127.4.20 remain unsupported; it's possible to start in them, but they're not expected to be in a good spot, and are not a priority to fix.

# History
- Historical characters with higher tier scar traits should now get proper scars.
- Shotoku's council is no longer fully depowered, meaning she won't pretty much immediately block internal vassal wars.
- Fixed Honorius' death reason.
- Fixed Minamoto Yoshitomo's death reason.
- Fixes to a couple of Cham rulers.
- Added nicknames for a bunch of historical rulers (and some other characters).
- Some date and trait tweaks to historical characters, because Paradox didn't necessarily care. Lots of weirdness remains, of course, because vanilla has a lot of questionable history...
- Historical characters in need of an armour stretcher should now look the part.
- Historical Romans now know to use "Hilarius" rather than "Hilary".
- With the sole exception of Herakleios there are no longer any characters awarded the "Crusader" trait ahead of the start of the First Crusade, unlike what vanilla thinks is reasonable.
- While the Childrens' Crusade was a thing, various historical characters that have nothing to do with that incident no longer gain the "Crusader" trait on birth. Again, vanilla being silly...
- Historical Saio/Saiin are now referred to as such.
- Improved the traits of Queen Sundeok.
- Kublai now becomes a Poet partway through his life.
- Fixed a couple of add_lover effects outside effect blocks.
- Disinherited historical characters in Japan no longer gain/lose the Bastard trait alongside the Disinherited trait.

# Religions and religion features
- Lowered Shinto Intrigue boost to +2 (was +3).
- Lowered Koshin Diplomacy boost to +2 (was +3).
- The unique Bimoist feature is now actually unique to them, as opposed to being both valid and highly rated for everyone.
- Unreformed Tengri and Jurchen pagans now have Defensive Attrition, seeing as there's no good reason for them not to have it.
- Unreformed Aztec and Yupaychaspa pagans now ignore Defensive Attrition.
- Hellenics now remember that the name "Alexander" (and its cultural variants) is a perfectly valid name; a great name, some might even say!

# Decisions
- It is now possible to Sway your rel head if they're non-Theocratic.
- It is no longer possible to falsely claim to belong to your liege's faith by decision if your liege doesn't care about religion, thus somewhat lowering the chance of SRSes where they don't make sense.
- It is no longer possible to ask to swap a child to the Heritage focus if their educator doesn't share your culture and religion.
- It is no longer possible to ask to swap a child to the Faith focus if their educator doesn't share your religion.
- It is no longer possible to ask to swap a child to the Heritage focus if you shouldn't care, e.g. if only the religion is mismatched and you're a nomad. Proud characters are excepted as far as both religion and culture goes, Zealous as far as religion goes.
- It is no longer possible to ask to swap a child to the Faith focus if you shouldn't care, e.g. if you're a nomad. Zealous characters are the exception
- Vassals can no longer offer to become tributaries of China. Sorry, Shimazu; you'll have to figure out a better trick with Ryukyu!
- Incapable, inaccessible, and/or imprisoned characters can no longer start composing books.
- The decision to mourn previously unmourned ancestors is now a high priority decision.
- The lower percentage plot fabrication decisions are no longer available if the higher percentage ones can be taken, seeing as there's absolutely no reason to take the worse one.
- Imperial Guard regiments can now only be raised if your realm size is greater or equal to 50.
- Raising a second Imperial Guard regiment now requires a realm size of 100 or more, and each regiment beyond the second requires another 100 realm size.
- WotRS members can now advance past the rank of Novice without proving themselves to a mentor, though only if ten years have passed since they joined the society.
- Player WotRS members of Samurai/Onna-bugeisha rank or above can now properly offer to mentor WotRS Novices; the blocker now correctly prevents the AI from offering to mentor the player, as opposed to preventing the player from targeting the AI.
- The FotK power to switch to Japanese Monastic Feudal is now properly allowed for Japanese Feudal player characters.
- The FotK power to switch to Japanese Monastic Feudal is now properly disallowed for Japanese Monastic Feudal player characters.
- It is no longer possible to ask your liege for a title while your liege is at war, bringing the decision in line with the AI pulse event.
- Made the AI less eager to found and refound Imperial Guard regiments.
- Increased the cost of founding, refounding, and retaking control of Imperial Guard regiments.
- Characters flagged to never convert should no longer convert to an attacker's religion in AI hands. They have chosen their hill, and they *will* die on it!

- It is no longer possible to request a Chinese artefact if the EoC can't grant you any additional ones at his current MoH rating.
- Fixed an issue where eunuch tributes might not be properly snipped or properly shipped off to China.
- Descriptions for many Grace interactions no longer overflow and no longer claim characters that aren't disinherited will be disinherited.
- Tributaries of CI realms may no longer break free by decision unless their suzerain has a sub-Average MoH rating; this helps ensure Song doesn't break the Treaty of Chanyuan very early, and helps Liao a bit.
- Made the AI more eager to go Japanese Feudal at higher tiers, hopefully making Japan more likely to slide towards a more feudal setup.

# Graphics and interface
- The "In mourning" trait icon should now be visible, as opposed to being invisible.
- Fixed Shinto/etc. dynasty CoA misalignment, at least partially.
- Hopefully fixed all black holding pictures.

# Cultures
- Tanguts now use tangutgfx if the "Tianxia Jade Dragon Portraits Expansion" ("Tianxia: Chinese, Khmer, & Tibetan Portraits" in the launcher) or another source of tangutgfx portraits is active. Note that the aforementioned graphical submod has been updated after 14.0.0's release, fixing an issue where all adult tangutgfx women looked positively ancient.
- Corrected spelling of Tsuhime; was "Tsuhgime", which of course can't be proper as it can't be spelled out in Hiragana!
- Sakahito and Sadatojo are no longer considered female Yamato names.
- Atlantean culture now has random = no.

# Artefacts
- Fixed the name and tag of the Danjing Yaojue.
- The Wuzi no longer has the Art of War effect.
- The Lessons for Women is now a bit better than the Womens' Analects.

# Casus belli
- MoH rebels that end up with very small realms will no longer see fit to claim the Mandate of Heaven.
- Wars to Maintain the Permanent Regency no longer end on the death of the Permanent Regent.
- The AI will now execute peasant/etc. revolt leaders if they defeat the revolt, thus removing some characters that are unlikely to add anything but a performance drain.
- The Chinese and Japanese Reconquest CBs should now only be visible on independent targets that are not your top liege.
- Winning an Imperial Claimant faction war now partially empowers the council and shifts the vassal war laws one step in the vassals' favour unless the faction leader becomes the new Tenno.
- The Grand Chancellor can now use the Chinese Subjugation CB regardless of their tier if fully empowered.
- Vassals can now use the Chinese Subjugation CB regardless of their tier if the interest group is fully empowered.
- Wars vs. the PR to take over the position as PR should no longer instantly invalidate.
- The War of Honor CB should now be visible as expected, as opposed to always being invisible.
- The Rising Sun Subjugation CB should now be visible as expected, as opposed to always being invisible.
- The Ryukyuan Subjugation CB should now be visible as expected, as opposed to always being invisible.
- Optimised some things.
- Hid several CBs for people that won't be eligible for them without e.g. conversion.
- County-tier adventurer conquests no longer give the conqueror a nickname, seeing as it's not particularly impressive.

# Traits
- The following traits are no longer possible to select in the Ruler Designer: Son/Daughter of Heaven, Former Son/Daughter of Heaven, Incapable according to regent.
- The following traits are no longer randomly handed out: Son/Daughter of Heaven, Former Son/Daughter of Heaven
- The Kitsune trait can now be selected in the Ruler Designer.
- The various non-Tribal Kinslayer traits are no longer removed on becoming tribal. They will instead be converted to Tribal Kinslayer on_startup, which should help ensure that some historical Kinslayers' deeds aren't forgotten about.

# Bloodlines
- Confucius' bloodline now allows for faster conversion to Confucianism.

# Laws and succession voting
- Attempted to fix Japanese and Chinese characters randomly deciding that women maybe should inherit.
- Each Regency Power law enacted in favour of the Permanent Regent now enacts one Council Power law in favour of the Council if the "same number" Council Power law is in the liege's favour, meaning that the liege starts out less powerful if the Permanent Regency ends.
- Fixed CleanSlate-derived bug where you weren't allowed to switch *to* Primogeniture if your liege can grant viceroyalties and you aren't a viceroy; as per the comment, the effect now is that non-Muslim viceroys *can* switch *to* primogeniture even if they wouldn't be allowed to if not a viceroy.
- Dai culture now unlocks access to Ultimogeniture (if not blocked for some reason, e.g. due to government type).
- Minahasan culture electors no longer care about the candidate's gender.

# Dynasties
- The mysterious "L??" dynasties have been renamed.

# Nicknames
- Added a bunch of new historical nicknames (and a few derived from historical ones).
- The "the Devil" nickname now has more sane restrictions.
- Louis the Blind is no longer born Blinded or with his nickname; his blinding has been moved to the proper date.

# Ambitions
- The "Become Immortal" ambition now cancels if you stop being a Taoist.
- The "Acquire Title" Ambition should now actually complete if the liege gives you a title through the relevant event, as opposed to being impossible to complete.
- It is now possible to retain the "Groom an Heir" Ambition after passing certain practical age thresholds if you have a living child.
- Celibate children now count for "Groom an Heir"; the trait isn't an inheritance blocker!

# Factions
- The AI will now be more eager to start Create Permanent Regency and Proclaim Shogunate factions if their liege has depowered the council, in whole or in part, though only if there isn't a Permanent Regency going on.
- Various bureaucrats are now more fond of increasing council power.
- Many faction-related instances of is_primary_holder_title have been replaced with is_primary_holder_title_tier; it changes vanilla, but it's odd not to be able to press your rightful claims on secondary titles just because your liege is a duke.
- Members of Jimmu's bloodline are now more likely to start Shogunate factions.
- Members of Hachimantaro's bloodline are now more likely to start Shogunate factions.

# Focuses
- All (adult) Focuses are now invalid for prisoners, seeing as leaving the Seduction focus available means the AI frequently goes "I am a prisoner, so I should pick Seduction!" and then goes on a Seduction rampage if freed. It changes vanilla, but vanilla's implementation is insane.

# Event modifiers
- Maidservant Lover and Bodyguard Lover modifiers are now only visible for the character that seduced them, as opposed to being visible to everyone, including possibly spouses.
- Religious trading communities now have a better icon.

# Societies
- Increased Hwarang joining age limit to 35 (was 30).
- Aside from the Tenno and the Ryukyuan rel head (regardless of reformation), the WotRS no longer permit rel heads to join.
- The WotRS no longer allow holy orders to join.
- The WotRS no longer allow mercs to join unless eligible for a Japanese government.

# Positions:
- The city, wonder, and unit positions for Ningdu should now actually be in Ningdu.
- Units in Lijiang are now, you know, actually in Lijiang.

# Scripted triggers
- can_have_japanese_monastic_feudal_trigger now works, as opposed to potentially evaluating to "yes" when it shouldn't.
- Mourning should now be available when expected.
- It is no longer possible to appoint landed characters as councillors while they are in seclusion, seeing as it would force them and their court out of seclusion. That feels like a Tzeentchian move, and he does not approve of spreading Grandfather Nurgle's love.
- Peasant Leaders are no longer permitted to join the WotRS; they are lowly people, even compared to merchants!
- Set up nickname "coolness" for various new nicknames.

# Scripted effects
- The MoH rating now suffers more from the presence of the Black Death than the presence of some lesser disease.
- Regular MoH updates now require passing certain realm size thresholds to reach Average or higher ratings if not already at the rating in question or at a higher rating.
- Fixed a mourning target bug.
- Various JD Chinese character spawns should now work.
- Improved on the MoH calculation, making it scale better with realm health and simultaneously fixing some issues where it might go very crazy.
- Raw realm size now matters less for the MoH calculation, seeing as there now are realm size thresholds for increasing the rating. Should hopefully help smaller (but not tiny) realms a bit.
- Very small CI realms have now been told to just die already (read: Will get severe penalties to their MoH rating due to their realm size).
- Fixes to some parts of the JD character creation that needs a character scope to work.
- The LNY year flag updates now always fire when someone starts preparing a LNY, as opposed to there possibly being a lack of updates.
- The LNY element calculation now checks the correct variable everywhere, as opposed to going off of the character's birth year everywhere.

# Council voting
- Special considerations towards the Tenno, the Ryukyuan knockoff, and various PRs and the dynasty members thereof should no longer come into play in irrelevant places.

# Minor titles
- Remover duplicate revoke_trigger block for the GC minor title.

# On actions
- Courtiers that get a new host for reasons other than imprisonment will now join their new host in seclusion if their new host is in seclusion. Fixes an issue where e.g. new spouses might get diseases because they married someone in seclusion and got stuck wandering a diseased province... but of course means that diseased courtiers joining someone in seclusion might cause interesting things to happen.

# Execution
- Adjusted the availability of a few options.

# Events
- Chinese Princesses that are abroad should now lose the marriage blocker if abroad on the update (e.g. on_yearly_pulse for the EoC), meaning that inviting them to your court as a foreigner actually might be beneficial.
- Members of the Desecrators and the Mandate Defiers can now get missions to desecrate temples belonging to holders that are considered "Close enough", not just holders of their own religion.
- Rulers that have no reason to care should no longer be informed about the start of the Viking AGe.

- Pilgrimages to Ise and Kumano no longer send you to the opposite location as a Shinto character.
- Decadence Revolters can no longer attack a target that's the primary defender in a Crusade/Jihad/GHW; it can invalidate the relevant war, which is no fun for anyone.
- Your female relatives should no longer tell you that they'd make great councillors when they are imprisoned, incapable, and/or inaccessible.
- Demon Hunters no longer go after inaccessible, incapable, and/or imprisoned DWs; they're either neutralised or hard to target at the moment.
- Excuses not to mourn should be proper.
- The WotRS should now be a bit faster at tracking down the Six, and the Unknown Master should also show up a bit more rapidly.
- Imprisoned, incapable, and/or inaccessible lieges should no longer be asked for nicknames.
- Imprisoned, incapable, and/or inaccessible courtiers should no longer be asking for nicknames.
- It is no longer possible to blame the Jews for epidemics for most rulers that would be ineligible to expel them with the normal decision, thus making it far less likely that random characters unlikely to have a Jewish presence in their realm will see fit to expel them when there is an epidemic.
- The farrier's apprentice/carpenter's daughter event should no longer hand out the Homosexual trait when the other child is of the opposite sex.
- The attractive peasant/courtier event now hands out orientation traits correctly, as opposed to going "You're the same sex as yourself, so the attractive person must have the same sex!" and handing out the Homosexual trait accordingly.
- Mainland SEAsia should no longer notify the world about the Black Death twice for the same epidemic.
- The WotRS will now only tell you to duel your rivals to the death if you're both part of the WotRS.
- Event 4055 ("Peasants saw a dragon!") event can no longer fire in China/Japan/etc., seeing as they shouldn't try to hunt down dragons there (Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, very much excepted).
- You can no longer steal your rival's skull if they are not part of the same top realm on death.
- Widows and children that are imprisonmed, inaccessible, and/or incapable will no longer catch you stealing skulls.
- Various RIP events now sanity check for imprisonment, incapacity, and inaccessibility, as opposed to assuming that just because someone was available when a character died they will keep on being available.
- The pyramid constructed to house the remains of a hunting dog now only lasts for 25 years, as opposed to lasting forever.
- Japanese Feudal characters and members of the WotRS will no longer write "The Sword and Buckler Manual"; shields are for cowards!
- MNM.10024 now only fires if the character actually is taking an interest in a society, as opposed to suggesting that you should refound the " " society if you stop showing interest in a society.
- The stacking negative modifier for unreasonable postponed mourning should now stack properly.
- Courtiers that are expected to mourn should now, you know, mourn.
- Disabled War focus spear-throwing contests for now; will need replacement, re-flavouring, or other adjustments, because not everyone would think throwing spears is reasonable for a warrior.
- Ranking up in the WotRS now clears the quest to find a mentor, seeing as only Novices can get mentors.
- Titles granted by the Tenno will now default to Agnatic or Agnatic-Cognatic most of the time.
- WotRS members should no longer try to discredit *random* society members in some events; they should try to discredit fellow WotRS members.

- Holy order grandmasters and rel heads should no longer be interested in secret religions.
- Zealous AI rulers should no longer sometimes go "Well, *maybe* I should pick up a secret religion...?".
- DW and SRS society leaders can now get missions, bringing those society types in line with other society types.
- Improved conditions for event 30004.
- "The Messenger" should now be someone that would consider ROOT compatible, not just someone ROOT considers compatible.
- Various DWs no longer outsource the very prestigious role of "The Messenger" to members of random societies; the relevant event now restricts the possible existing member to a society member based on the flag ROOT has, rather than ruling out specific DW societies (but not *other* societies) if ROOT doesn't have a matching flag.
- Increased AI Hwarang joining willingness a bit.
- WotRS mentor-student opinion modifiers are now properly cleared up when leaving the society, and the other party remembers it.
- Hwarang Spiritual Guidance opinion modifiers now get cleared out when leaving the Hwarang.
- The WotRS will no longer tell you to go after distant landlocked targets just because you have a coastal province; the target also needs a coastal province now.

- The Saio/Saiin will now be referred to as such.
- Breakaway pretender emperors should now get a proper starting MoH setup.
- Divine Ancestry rel head titles will now be destroyed on_death if the current heir is not part of the relevant bloodline, assuming the current holder is part of the relevant bloodline.

- Other Court Chaplain sanity fixes.
- Added some sanity checks for some Chancellor events.
- Non-tribal non-nomadic Ancestor Worshippers now get to offer a small amount of incense instead of a carved idols, because carved idols are not suitable in some places.
- You should no longer go "My concubine is pregnant? Great!" and then immediately go "My concubine is pregnant, but I was away, wasn't I?" when it comes to the same concubine and pregnancy.
- WoL.1033 no longer cause the spouse you attack in WoL.1012 to attack themselves. Funny, but no.

- Improved portrait in WotRS poetry events.
- Non-rulers should no longer have the option to somehow get "their" Court Physician new books/tools.

- Manichaean merchant Court Physicians are now Uyghur rather than Khitan, seeing as the latter makes a lot less sense.
- Chinese Court Physicians created when using the "Recruit Court Physician" decision (or when the relevant event chain is triggered from elsewhere) now actually spawn, as opposed to the event not creating a character and speaking of a village drunkard.

- MoH rebel reinforcements no longer attempt to join an unrelated nationalist revolt.

- Added event borders for some events that lacked them (and therefore used the default).

- The AI is now less likely to find the Great Dharani Sutra.
- Pacifist AI characters are no longer particularly interested in a pirate's life.

Beta 14.0.0 - 09/12/2023
--------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: Tianxia has now been rebased off of CleanSlate; CleanSlate 1.0 Beta 6.1 [EZKM] (https://github.com/ck2plus/CleanSlate/releases/tag/1.0-beta6.1) MUST be active for Tianxia to run.
IMPORTANT: Any old Tianxia.mod file MUST be replaced with the new one; the new version contains important changes, such as actually setting up CleanSlate as a dependency.
IMPORTANT: Old saves are expected to be horribly broken; you have been warned.
IMPORTANT: Random/Shattered world and the EU4 Converter are not supported.
IMPORTANT: Start dates after 1127.4.20 remain unsupported; it's possible to start in them, but they're not expected to be in a good spot, and are not a priority to fix.

NOTE: This version has been in development for a good amount time, with several things being iterated on more than once. As a consequence, some things might be missing below and others might be incorrect.

# General
- Optimized various things.
- Only feudal (is_feudal = yes) characters need apply to be Permanent Regents, Grand Chancellors, or Shoguns.
- Removed stored_mandate_change; the MoH variable is now affected more directly.
- Rulers who lack religious branch traits due to vanilla oversight should now gain branch traits automatically by event after some time.
- Mourning celibacy and regular celibacy should now be cleared in some cases if someone isn't celibate, say because they're tumbling a seducer.
- Added sanity checking for some trait/bloodline inheritance stuff where bastardry comes into play.
- Reminded the Tenno that he does not serve; he rules!
- Wrapped many random_lists without visible effects in hidden_tooltip. Some of them might be replaced with visible custom_tooltips later.
- Created credits.txt, to both ensure that credits can be found outside the forum thread and to facilitate easier updating thereof.

# Ambitions
- Made it easier to start the ambition to become a Grand Chancellor. Now requires 2000 prestige or your liege having a regency (was 5000 prestige).
- The "Become Grand Chancellor" ambition is now available even if your liege is from your dynasty.
- The "Become Grand Chancellor" ambition is now available even if a dynasty member of yours is on your liege's council with such a bloodline.
- The "Become Grand Chancellor" ambition is now available even if your liege has a fully depowered council.
- Confucians and members of a religion with the A Focus on Family Doctrine are now more likely to pick the Family Focus.
- Confucians and members of a religion with the A Focus on Family Doctrine are now more likely to pick the Groom an Heir Ambition.
- Confucians and members of a religion with the A Focus on Family Doctrine now gain 100 piety when completing the Groom an Heir Ambition.
- Taoists now have access to the "Reject [Negative Trait]" ambitions.
- The ambition to become the Grand Chancellor now requires JD + Conclave.
- Characters with a bureaucratic government now only need to wait one year (as opposed to five) to take the "See the Realm Prosper" ambition if it is cancelled, and only five years (as opposed to 25) if it succeeds.
- Added a "Become a famous writer" ambition, requiring you to write books with a combined artefact level of 10+.
- Blocked "Become King of X" ambition when that's impossible, e.g. under a CI liege that doesn't allow vassal kingdom creation.
- Considering a certain job requirement, becoming a Council Eunuch no longer counts for the "Become Councillor" ambition (players can't be Council Eunuchs anyway; landed characters are ineligible).
- Fixed issues with ambition selection for women under equal laws or doctrines.
- Female Enatic rulers will now plot to kill their husbands if they don't have a daughter and their husband is an eunuch.
- Added a new ambition for Taoists to become Immortal. This makes it more likely that the "Matters of Life and Death" event will fire, and will do other things down the line.
- obj_marry_ruler now respects gender equality.
- Homosexual characters no longer aspire to marry rulers.
- Replaced the free upgrades from obj_create_wonder with a bloodline; said upgrades are NOT valid choices for all wonders in Tianxia, and getting an unwanted upgrade as a "reward" does not feel very nice.
- Completing obj_create_wonder now gives the "the Architect" nickname if you don't already have a "super cool" nickname.
- Characters that oppose getting married will no longer take ambitions to get married or have children. Yes, marriage isn't a strict requirement, but it's still odd.

# Artefacts and the spawning thereof
- Changed the Sarira to spawn for has_dharmic_religion_trigger = yes characters, rather than indian_group characters, which should make it less likely to show up in weird places.
- The Heirloom Seal of the Realm is no longer guaranteed to spawn after 936; rediscovery TODO.
- The Seven-Branched Sword now spawns for the character owning c_yamato rather than the Tenno, seeing as it is stored in Isonokami Shrine in Nara Prefecture (and also isn't part of the Imperial Regalia).

- Simplified the logic for the Tenno's artefact spawns.

- The Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki is now more likely to spawn for women.
- The Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki no longer is more likely to spawn for Minamotos.
- Cura Si Manjakini should now spawn for the holder of c_temasek in 1299 or later regardless of their primary title.

- Sang Sapurba's bloodline now makes you eligible to use Cura Si Manjakini.
- Lowered Vijaya's Hindu opinion boost to +5.
- Gram now gives +1 combat rating.
- The Ornate Holy Symbol artefact can now be gifted to someone with the same religion rather than true_religion, as it otherwise reveals someone's secret religion.
- Lowered the PCS given by most Tianxia weapon artefacts; Kusanagi, Vijaya, Thuan Thien, the Tenka-Goken, and the Hungering Blade are now +20, rest are +16 or less.
- Assorted Korean book artefacts now actually check for e.g. Koreanic + Buddhist/Taoist/Confucian rather than Koreanic OR Buddhist/Taoist/Confucian.
- The Crown of Thorns now is in the grubby hands of the Latin Empire rather than completely missing following the Fourth Crusade (prior to being transferred to France in 1238).

- Blocked the ability to rename the Heirloom Seal of the Realm and various pagan reformer artefacts, in addition to the Imperial Regalia of Japan.

- A bunch more Chinese books, mostly ones related to history, are now considered Grace artefacts.
- Added reformer artefacts.
- Commented out chinese_prev_emperor_sculpture (unused in Tianxia), chinese_book_history (we use historical ones instead), and chinese_journal (unused in Tianxia).

- The Art of War can now be used to temporarily increase Martial, in addition to its previous effects.
- Some Art of War pages will now spawn at the start.
- Restricted the famous_<body part> artefacts to Christians due to them being pretty odd in some places; might revisit down the line.
- Changed prestige rewards for the above to piety rewards, seeing as the Christian loc is "<Body part> of a Saint".
- Removed infamous_tongue artefact; it's quite odd.
- Lunatics may no longer equip other ceremonial weapons if in possession Sanity's Demise. That would be wrong, don't you think...?

- Removed indestructibility from some artefacts that didn't need it.

- Artefact "active" blocks now use numerical operators.

# Bloodlines
- All Chinese Imperial bloodlines (including pretenders) now have a better picture.

- Various regency bloodlines no longer give Shinto opinion.
- The Very Best bloodline, the Hwarang refounding bloodline, and all generic Grand Chancellor bloodlines now count as created bloodlines.
- Added a bloodline for Imperial Family agnates (intentionally not powerful).
- Some NANDs that should have been NOTs are now NOTs.
- Added JD Chinese character spawning (with JD) to relevant bloodlines.
- Removed the Ancestor Veneration bloodlines tied to Jewish sympathy for Tianxia pagans; most of the functionality didn't work, and they were set to only be active if Christian.

- Various Shogunate bloodlines now give access to great heroes (with HF).
- It is now possible to benefit from Grand Chancellor bloodlines if your liege is from your dynasty, but still not if you are independent.
- Improved the Genghis Khan bloodline, and made it available without HF (Sky Burials and other DLC mechanics remain DLC-locked), seeing as it is relevant to Yuan.
- All Grand Chancellor bloodlines (including historical ones) now also increase the likelihood of characters becoming Ambitious, in addition to their previous effects.

- Added a bloodline for Munmu of Silla, similar to that available for Taejo of Goryeo.
- Both Taejo and Munmu's bloodline can now spawn special Chinese commanders with JD.
- Added many, many new Chinese Imperial bloodline names, primarily inspired by historical Chinese dynasties and historical Chinese states.

- Added (intentionally very weak) bloodlines to track the agnates of the four Fujiwara branches (Nanke, Hokke, Shikike, and Kyoke).

- Wu Zetian's bloodline now stands out a bit more due to having a different icon.
- Added a bloodline for the Tenson dynasty.
- Set up an empty bloodline for the Saoshyant regardless of DLC, to help ensure proper propagantion of saoshyant_descendant.

- Wonder bloodlines now give some Architect opinion.

# Bookmarks

- Reordered bookmark characters.

# Buildings and wonders
- The tb_defensive_fortifications_NUMBER buildings in tribal holdings can now be built by various defensive Tianxia pagans.
- Cleaned up commented out "empty" tribal pillars for Tianxia pagans.
- Greater Shrines and Shrines to Amaterasu-Omikami and Ninigi-no-Mikoto no longer grant Amaterasu Descendant opinion, bringing them more in line with other upgrades.
- Buddhists can only use the Temple and Cemetery of Confucius if they'd be eligible for Chinese Imperial, as opposed to always.
- Zealous non-Confucians can't use the Temple and Cemetery of Confucius, even if their religion otherwise would make them eligible.
- If the Temple and Cemetery of Confucius has the correct upgrade members of the Kong family that are members of Confucius' bloodline can be buried there if they control the wonder. Women need not apply.
- "Civilized" pagans can now build and use Great Libraries and Grand Universities prior to reforming.
- Japonic Buddhists can no longer begin the construction of a Shinto Grand Shrine, but they can still benefit from such wonders unless Zealous.
- The Temple and Cemetery of Confucius now has fewer pre-built upgrades in order to allow for some degree of customization.
- The Temple and Cemetery of Confucius now has access to more upgrade types.
- Added a Grand Taoist Temple Wonder, with upgrades.
- Added a (generic) Temple of Confucius Wonder, using a subset of the upgrades for the Temple and Cemetery of Confucius.
- Added Bureaucratic Center buildings for various bureaucratic governments.
- Samurai Dojos now grant Horse Archers and Pikemen, not Heavy Infantry.
- Grand Torii now increase monthly prestige, rather than improving Zealous opinion. Grand Torii might be impressive, but Zealous unbelievers certainly would not approve.
- Added Shugendo and Koshin shrine upgrades to Shinto Great Shrine wonders.
- Removed Shrines and Greater Shrines to Izanami and Izanagi; they were rather hard to balance, and the Shinto Grand Shrine Wonder still has plenty of options.

# CBs
- Fixed some potential cases of sacriligious Chrysanthemum Throne usurpation.
- Fixed some incorrect tooltips regarding what would be obtainable from certain CBs.
- Cleaned up old, irrelevant CBs related to Decadence for Chinese dynasties. That hasn't been relevant since JD...
- Cleaned up old, unused Chinese county conquest CB. Another CB that's not ben relevant for a good while...
- Wars to overthrow the Permanent Regent can now end in a white peace, restoring the regent but not punishing the liege aside from a prestige loss.
- Wars to overthrow the Permanent Regent waged against the Regency Loyalists no longer end the Permanent Regency on a white peace.

- Added new CB to press the de facto claims of valid Imperial Family members on the Chrysanthemum Throne.
- Religious Liberation is now also blocked if your top liege would be disallowed due to their government.
- "Chinese enough" and "Japanese enough" pagans that are NOT nomads are no longer eligible for the pagan County Conquest CB; such realms are not meant to be expansionistic in that fashion. The optional JD Border Dispute CB has been made avaliable for these rulers if it is enabled.
- The Holy War CB and its pagan and Buddhist counterparts now show up in the GUI for people that'd be eligible if they were independent but that are blocked by their top liege's government type.

- Reworked the Japanese Reconquest CB, and made it free for the Tenno (similar to how the Roman Imperial Reconquest is free for the RE).

- Rising Sun Subjugations can no longer target a Ryukyuan Tenno knockoff or any liege thereof.

- Fixed broken warlord_consolidation prestige cost.
- The Grand Chancellor no longer needs prestige to use the warlord_consolidation CB.
- The Grand Chancellor can now use the warlord_consolidation CB regardless of their liege's MoH rating, provided the realm permits internal warfare.
- Winning a War of Honor against a rival now results in you imprisoning said rival, regardless of whether you were the attacker or the defender, making it slightly more useful.
- Becoming the Grand Chancellor through war now requires JD + Conclave.
- A potential GC that hasn't previously created a GC bloodline will now do so when enthroning a claimant through a faction war, even if they already have such a bloodline.
- The GC is now further empowered if there's a new GC following a faction war even if they did not create a bloodline.
- Shi Jingtang is now correctly viewed as a traitor if he loses or white peaces his starting war.
- Hopefully fixed some instances of peasant/etc. revolters becoming republics. Jumped-up peasant or not, you should prefer being some flavour of feudal!
- However much of a barbarian you might be due to your inferior government type, you may no longer use "But I'm tribal!" as an excuse to circumvent Chinese/Japanese religious CB rules.
- Winning a Chinese Subjugation war as the attacker against a king+ ruler will now award a super cool nickname if you are young enough.
- Assorted potentially relevant CBs that could grant the "the Conqueror" nickname can now grant the "the Little Conqueror" nickname if the conqueror is young enough.
- Papuan county invaders will no longer get the "the Conqueror" nickname, seeing as it's not all that impressive to conquer a county.
- Added Mandate penalties (and sometimes gains) to various CBs.
- Fixed bug letting CI/JI/DI rulers press others' claims.
- Beating the Takeover faction now moves the vassal influence law two steps in the liege's favour.
- Rulers eligible for Chinese/Japanese governments (if feudal) can no longer wage holding wars against holy orders with leaders that technically would be eligible for the same subset.
- Made it harder to push a woman's claim on an Agnatic Chinese Imperial title.
- Rivals will now wage Wars of Honour more often.
- Friends and lovers will now be much less likely to wage Wars of Honour.
- Adjusted some ai_will_do blocks to account for the See the Realm Prosper ambition.
- Shi Jingtang will now usurp Bianjing, Chang'an, and Luoyang if he wins his starting war (assuming they're part of the same realm), and will if possible move his capital to Bianjing.
- Tyranny wars against CI/EI/ConBu rulers now forces abdication to the attacker rather than a dynasty member if won.
- China will now experience the same consequences from losing tyranny wars as from takeover/non-dynastic claimant faction wars.
- Updated the Jin + Song vs. Liao war to no longer target a non-existent tributary.
- Mandate revolters that win their war now institute Primogeniture in their realm.
- Updated Pagan Subjugation to account for new pagans eligible for CI/etc.

- Told new pagans in China to stop with the county conquests already.

- If eligible, the Child of Destiny will now create a pretender empire upon gaining their first kingdom.
- Changed Go Yeongchang's war against Liao to be an attempt to take over Liao rather than an independence war; it makes more sense that way.
- MoH revolters now get some piety upon winning their revolt, making it possible for them to wage some Chinese Subjugation wars right away.
- Increased range of Rising Sun Subjugation to within four sea zones; it's less fun if the attacker is blocked due to being in the wrong part of Japan
- Rising Sun Subjugations can no longer be waged against WotRS members
- Should a MoH uprising win, the attacker will now create a pretender empire unless there's another Peasant Leader CI emperor around (having everyone do it is a bit much...).
- Added a requirement that the holder holds at least two de jure counties in the target title for the Chinese, Japanese, and Ryukyuan Subjugation CBs, bringing them in line with the Indian Subjugation CB and making it a bit less likely that the AI will waste it.
- Shi Jingtang's event troops now disband on peace. Should make it less likely Jin goes on a conquest spree right after defeating Tang... and should make it less wise to alter a certain deal...
- Kejawèn rulers now have holy wars along Buddhist lines rather than Hindu lines.
- Updated Permanent Tributary CB and related events to account for CI would-be-suzerains.
- The Manifest Destiny CB is now tied to Seljuk and Timur's bloodlines if HF is active, bringing it more in line with other CBs dependent on lineage.
- The Manifest Destiny CB can no longer be used if eligible for a Chinese- or Japanese- style government or if a vassal of a ruler with such a government.
- MRs that are "Chinese enough", "Japanese enough", or that has such a liege or above no longer have access to their coastal city/county conquest CBs. Merchants are useless members of society, after all, so closing such unintended exploits is just and necessary.
- Rulers that are mourning can no longer declare war.
- Tributaries now correctly abdicate their titles after losing a war for increased tributary tier.
- Tributaries no longer get to break free after losing a war for increased tributary tier. China remembers what it declared the war for, thank you very much.
- Losing a tributary tier war as the tributary now forces you to abdicate to China's preferred heir (excluding the Tenno, who merely abdicates "normally"; it's too risky to let China pick).
- Tossed out vanilla's highly questionable "Characters with a capital in Europe needs Majesty 4 to wage permanent tributary wars" condition; it means e.g. moving the ERE's capital from Constantinople to a random Anatolian county unlocks the CB. Everyone that's not got a bloodline making it easier to get tributaries now needs Majesty 2.
- Updated clean_up_after_leaving_society_effect to account for Tianxia's societies.
- chinese_reconquest is now also accessible for independent Chinese culture group ConBu/EI kings/emperors even if there is a CI China, but they may not normally target CI realms (successful Mandate revolters still can).
- warlord_consolidation now has a one year truce, similar to other subjugation CBs. Should make interesting times more interesting.
- Improved CI dynasty flag cleanup for certain historical wars.
- TF punitive expeditions and TF tributary wars now invalidate on CI dynasty change in China.
- nick_the_lionheart is now rather more restricted.
- Kingdom-tier Tianxia CBs now result in Roman triumphs if the target is the ERE/RE and Christian/Hellenic.

# Combat tactics
- Various Tianxia combat tactics have been revised/replaced.
- All Tianxia WLs have unique combat tactics, as one would expect.

# Council voting
- AI Permanent Regents will no longer be Loyalists unless they are friends or lovers of their liege.
- AI councillors eligible for Chinese Imperial (theoretically; this is to cover (Xi-)Xia), Confucian Bureaucracy, or Japanese Bureaucracy now care about their liege's MoH rating when deciding on their voting pattern.
- Moved Japanese council logic (e.g. "No, I will not support executing the Tenno if you or I logically should care!") to a separate voting pattern and made it take precedence over everything else.
- Moved Council Eunuch logic to a separate file and made it relevant for Pragmatists (beating the normal pragmatist pattern), Glory Hounds (below the normal Glory Hound pattern), and Zealots (before the normal family-based logic).
- Added new bureaucrat voting logic for all bureaucratic government vassals with bureaucratic government lieges (Chinese/Eastern/Japanese/Divine Imperial, Confucian/Japanese Bureaucracy). Largely similar to the eunuch logic when it comes to landing/revoking/wars, and inserted at (effectively) the same priority level, but these make exceptions for their own dynasty members.
- Eunuchs and bureaucrats now care about nepotism as far as the liege's dynasty goes (unless it is also their dynasty).
- Added and expanded patterns for new Chinese-style laws.
- Updated voting pattern selection for new Chinese-style laws.
- Council Eunuchs will now oppose imprisoning fellow Council Eunuchs unless Loyalist/forced by a Favour or the target is a rival.
- Council Eunuchs now correctly oppose further empowering vassals.
- Council Eunuchs and bureaucrats will no longer be in favour of granting land to non-feudal (is_feudal = no) rulers, and will generally be okay with revoking stuff from them.
- Council Eunuchs and bureaucrats are now much less likely to support title grants to female characters.
- Japanese Feudal and Japanese Monastic Feudal characters are now much less likely to support title grants to female characters.

# Cultures
- Deleted unused Buryat and Kashmiri cultures.
- Set Papuan culture as used_for_random = no, seeing as it's offmap until/unless the Treasure Fleet zails east/SRI happens and is unlikely to end up landed even when those things happen.
- Set Papuan culture as seafarer = yes. They'll need all the help they can get.
- Added the Kadazan-Dusun culture.
- Adjusted culture setup and added new cultures in China, SEAsia. Updating of some historical characters and palceholders still TODO.
- Added and improved many namelists
- Split the Malayo-Polynesian culture group.
- Viet culture is now in its own culture group.
- Reorganized non-vanilla culture files a bit.
- Yamato and Wako dukes have been reminded that Japan does not do "Kings".
- Khitans no longer name titles after dynasties; it's the Yelü dynasty, vanilla!
- Updated the colour of some cultures.
- Added seafarer = yes to Tamil culture, because Cholas.
- Added seafarer = yes to Malay, Cham, Javanese culture.
- Added parent = roman to Italian and Sardinian.
- Added parent = french to Outremer.
- Corrected gross oversight as far as cat names goes; the best feline overlord is now included!
- Corrected "Tiomat" to "Tiamat". She was not amused.
- Commented out some dragon names in the wrong gender namelist. I'm reasonably sure both Deathwing and Bahamut are male.
- Added a few more dragon names.
- Removed dukes_called_kings = yes from some cultures that shouldn't have petty kings.
- Expanded the Japanese (and Wako) male namelist somewhat.
- Updated secondary_event_pictures for a number of cultures to have them fallback to a similar culture first.
- Revised the Batak namelist, removing many names that were clan names or otherwise terrible, and adding new ones.
- Linked some more names to ensure regnal numbers work as they should in more cases.
- Updated Malay names and derived names.
- Updated Javanese names and derived names slightly and fixed history.
- Improved Tagalog and Cebuan namelists.
- Revised Papuan namelist.
- Replaced Dayak and Banjar namelists with slightly less wrong placeholder namelists.
- Added a new culture related to one very specific Treasure Fleet scenario.
- Cham is now feminist = yes.
- Tagalog and Cebuan are now feminist = yes.
- "Petrus" (Peter) is now a Roman name; vanilla had skipped it for whatever reason, even though a certain Petrus Sabbatius was quite important (you might know him as Ioustinianos/Justinian the Great).

# Death reasons and death text
- Updated "holy warrior" death text to account for Tianxia pagan "Crusaders".
- Opened up death_execution_boiling to all Cruel non-nomads.

# Decisions
- Fixed society recruitment for some Tianxia DW societies not allowing the recruitment of certain Buddhists.
- Made the AI check some decisions a bit less frequently in the name of performance.
- Adjusted prestige costs for the Become Grand Chancellor decision, making it take CI interest group laws into account.
- The decision to convert culture from Emishi to Ainu no longer requires you to have Yamato culture.
- The AI no longer sees a reason to look for a Mass Conversion if they've got Chinese Imperial/etc.
- The AI will no longer bother with changing government
- You no longer lose prestige when changing to Japanese Feudal using the decision (the WotRS decision still costs society currecy, since that's easier), but there's still a prestige requirement to take the decision.
- You no longer lose piety when changing to Japanese Monastic Feudal using the decision (the FotK decision still costs society currecy, since that's easier), but there's still a piety requirement to take the decision.
- You can now convert to Japanese Feudal or Japanese Monastic Feudal without amassing prestige or piety if your top liege has the desired government and shares your dynasty (and you are eligible for the government). to/from Japanese Feudal from/to Japanese Monastic Feudal.
- Removed the ability for Japanese Monastic Feudal to sponsor Mass Conversions and to send missionaries to foreign lands. The Shinto religion doesn't do that, and nor would a Ryukyuan imitation.
- Chinese Imperial emperors with a sub-Average MoH rating or highly influential vassals can no longer demand that vassals make peace or switch to Gavelkind using the targeted decisions.
- The Tenno and the Shogun can no longer demand that vassals make peace or switch to Gavelkind using the targeted decisions if they have a Permanent Regent.
- The EoC no longer accept ingredients as Tributes. Really, even next to assorted other paltry trinkets a random eyeball or herb is an insult.
- Removed irrelevant decision to restore the Manichean leadership; it's around in all start dates in vanilla since a while back.
- The AI now correctly is more interested in receiving Spiritual Guidance if they have one of the related ambitions, rather than being more interested in receiving it from someone that has one of those ambitions.
- The cost for asking someone for Spiritual Guidance is now lower if you've been given a quest to receive it.
- Fixed incorrect references to a non-existent "hwarng" society.

- WotRS members looking for a student will now be less likely to approach a terrible warrior.
- Improved some potential/from_potential blocks for WotRS stuff.
- Added a decision for the Tenno to found Heian-kyo if you start in 769. It's kind of an important city, so you should...
- Removed the now irrelevant decision to meddle/cancel meddling in the Tenno's succession.
- Cut the "Hey, can I be your Permanent Regent?" decisions and the "Hey, could you end this whole Permanent Regency thing, please?" decisions. Use the ultimatums, and fight for it if necessary.
- If you or your liege have a bureaucratic government the "Request land for Son/Daughter" decision now requires a valid adult son/daughter.
- Fixed several issues with the regency powers, added a few more, and did some general polishing.
- Added a targeted decision for the Tenno to give the Taira surname to Imperial Family members, working effectively the same way as the decision to give someone the Minamoto surname. This decision is impossible to use after the Genpei War, seeing as the Tairas lost. The AI will not use it, due to the risk of it stupiding the Imperial Family into extinction.
- Added a player-only (the AI does it using an on_yearly_pulse event) decision to restore an agnate to the Imperial Family.
- If the Tenno uses the special decision to recreate Japan while holding the de jure liege title of a Japanese kingdom (including Ezo and Ryukyu) the title in question will instantly de jure drifct into Japan.
- If the Tenno uses the special decision to recreate Japan while holding a Japanese kingdom (including Ezo and Ryukyu) the title in question will instantly de jure drifct into Japan
- Conclave and Horse Lords dynamic mercs can no longer be created by rulers with a bureaucratic (any flavour) top liege. It'd have been very frowned upon to hire out troops you were effectively borrowing from the central government.
- Added a decision to end a Permanent Regency if there is no landed Permanent Regent in the realm (and you're not currently waging war against them), to deal with some possible edge cases.
- The visibility for the JD decision to become Chinese Imperial is now more appropriate.
- The AI no longer needs a ton of prestige to become Chinese Imperial (it still needs as much as the human player would need).
- Mandate of Heaven revolters now get a discount of becoming Chinese Imperial, similar to CI bloodline members.
- The prestige cost for becoming Chinese Imperial now scales based on whether China is held, whether China's holder is Chinese Imperial or Eastern Imperial (or neither), and the MoH rating of the holder if Chinese Imperial, potentially making it very cheap.
- Added AI logic for becoming Chinese Imperial, checking e.g. traits.
- Various conversion decision (e.g. Shinto <-> Buddhist) are now self-targeted targeted_decisions, consistent with vanilla.
- Removed Tengri Jurchen -> Taoist/Buddhist conversion.
- The non-Grace decisions to hire various JD characters (e.g. Sholar-Bureaucrats) now requires both you and your top liege to have one of the Chinese governments, making it more widely available geographically (it was previously restricted to rulers in the China region or under China) but somewhat more restrictive from a government standpoint.
- The decision for e.g. Chinese Imperial rulers to take their de jure capital is now only allowed for king+ rulers.
- The Deed to the Dragon Throne is now only usable by feudal (is_feudal = yes) characters.
- Only the holder of the Grand Chancellor minor title can demand that others on their liege's council backs them using the GC targeted decision.
- Grand Chancellor bloodline members cannot ask the Grand Chancellor minor title holder to give up their spot on their liege's council. They won't fall for *that* trick again!
- Chinese Imperial Guard regiments might now fall under the control of the eunuchs, requiring their tacit approval to use.
- Losing the Mandate of Heaven now means the Imperial Guard regiments can't be hired until you manage to raise your Mandate rating to at least Poor.
- It is no longer possible to request a swap to the Heritage focus if the child is eligible for a Chinese/Japanese government and would be rendered ineligible with your culture/religion.
- It is no longer possible to request a swap to the Faith focus if the child is Shinto and part of the Imperial Family, nor if the child is Reformed Ryukyuan and part of a Ryukyuan knockoff's imperial family.
- You can longer torture, mutilate, humiliate, or eat the Tenno or the Ryukyuan knockoff, assuming you should care. Reading questionable poetry is, however, still on the table.
- Chinese Imperial rulers can no longer become the Samrat Chakravartin; you are China (or want to be), and anything other than the Mandate of Heaven is irrelevant.
- The Tenno can no longer create custom CM empires, to avoid any possibility of an "Empire of Takamikura" abomination forming.
- Dynamic merc titles now use the creator's capital as their capital, which hopefully should make instances of e.g. an Hungarian merc company being hired by the Tenno vanishingly rare.
- The holder of e_chagatai now gets to hold the Nerge rather than Grand Hunts, consistent with the other Mongol successor states.
- Treated vanilla's decision to lock the creation of Antioch and Cyprus to Catholics as a bug, and enabled it for Fraticelli as well since they have the same crusade mechanics and should be able to get the same crusader states.
- Cleaned up irrelevant code for CI transfer from a post-Fourth Crusade title to the ERE since CI rulers can't restore the ERE.
- It is no longer possible to execute the Tenno or the Ryukyuan knockoff using a brazen bull, dragonfire, or the option to add them to a macabre banquet, assuming you should care.
- It is no longer possible to disband PR/Shogunate-related factions with bloodline powers.
- Japonic Buddhist men that are forced to take monastic vows now join the Fellowship of the Kami rather than the regular Buddhist MO.
- Japonic Buddhist men that are forced to take monastic vows that have a martial education or lifestyle will now go to the Sohei, assumingt they exist.

- Taoist, Confucian, Shinto, and most Tianxia pagans now have access to the Ancestor Worship decision inherently.
- Non-Zealous Shinto rulers can now gain Sympathy for Pagans by decision if they have a pagan (any flavour) liege, vassal, or province.
- Confucians have access to the Inspire Meliorism targeted decisions if HF is active.
- Assorted Grand Chancellor decisions now require JD + Conclave.
- Minor improvements to various GC decisions.
- The decision to appoint new Council Eunuchs might now select eligible eunuchs in your court instead of generating a new eunuch.
- The decision to appoint new Council Eunuchs is now more expensive for the EoC, seeing as it's somewhat likely he'll have eunuchs around.
- The Tenno no longer gets to employ goldsmiths, seeing as he already possesses all the signs of imperial power he should need (read: The Imperial Regalia). He can, however, use crown jewels that come into his possession in some other fashion.
- The Grand Chancellor bloodline decision's prestige requirement now scales with the liege's vassal influence law, if relevant.
- AI Confucian and Japanese Bureaucracy rulers are now somewhat more likely to write books.
- Nomads settling should now be a bit less likely to create custom titles, seeing as those are no fun to deal with from a scripting perspective.
- Improved the decisions to get special JD characters, making the conditions a bit better and allowing them for feudal rulers with a Chinese character (any subset) bloodline even if they don't have a Chinese government.
- If the Tenno or the Ryukyuan knockoff ends up as a tribal or nomadic ruler through some convoluted loophole they are no longer allowed to become merchant republics.
- Assorted PR, GC, and Shogun decisions are now only available for feudal (is_feudal = yes) characters.
- Added a scaling (based on how China is doing) realm size check for adopting Chinese Imperial.
- Unreformed Shenists now pay less to adopt Chinese Imperial (similar to reformed Shenists, Taoists, and Confucians).
- Made the AI willing to write books when they already have one if having Confucian Bureaucracy, Japanese Bureaucracy, or the ambition to become a famous writer.
- Added a decision to become Chinese Imperial as a king (resulting in the creation of one of the titular CI empires).
- Fixed some caste-related oddities.
- Japonic Buddhist lieges (or above) of the Ryukyuan knockoff can no longer become the Samrat Chakravartin.
- The decision to enact the plot to fabricate a claim on a Chinese Imperial title's chance of succeeding now depends on the holder's MoH rating.
- Added decision for Spiritual religions to gain stat boosts in exchange for piety.
- It's no longer possible to make the parent/grandparent/etc. of your current heir a Minamoto/Taira, seeing as that'd also disinherit your current heir and that that'd thus be a loophole in the "No disinheriting your current heir" limitation.
- The generic tributary breakaway decision now lets a tributary of China instantly break free regardless of tier, paying the Grace to lower tier one step and not letting China dispute this decision. Of course, China might not be happy...
- The generic tributary breakaway decision is now also available if your suzerain has Lost the Mandate of Heaven.
- Tributaries of China cannot break away with the generic decision if they've got a Chinese Peace Deal.
- If China asks for a border adjustment and the target refuses, all relevant titles are claimed by the EoC.
- The prestige cost of overthrowing the Permanent Regency now scales with the number of Regency Power laws that have been enacted, making it much harder to achieve if a powerful PR temporarily isn't the regent.
- Disinherited characters can no longer be legitimized, to prevent certain silliness.
- Shugendo and Kejawen can now syncretize with pagans.
- Many Tianxia pagans can now syncretize with the Eastern religions.

- Made various syncretism decisions consistent with the HF one as far as being capable adults goes.
- Added decisions for a suitable Viet emperor of Vietnam to instantly de jure drift Guangxi and Guangdong into Vietnam, assuming the liege title of those does not exist. Nam Viet shall rise again!
- It is no longer possible to negotiate with raiding adventurers that are at war, as that can result in some silly things.
- Members of the Fellowship of the Kami no longer need Holy Fury to become Japanese Monastic Feudal with the society decision.
- Replaced the Fellowship of the Kami's culture and religion conversion powers with powers to make the relevant religions like you more.
- The Tenno, the Shogun, and the Ryukyuan knockoff can no longer kowtow to China. They're obviously above that!
- Shinto or suitably reformed Ryukyuan theocracies can now potentially become Japanese Monastic Feudal if count+.
- Possession of the Heirloom Seal of the Realm makes both decisions to become Chinese Imperial significantly easier to take... though bypassing the realm size requirement is perhaps not very smart.
- Added a new decision for sufficiently powerful feudal rulers eligible for Chinese Imperial to claim e_china if they possess the Heirloom Seal of the Realm. If a vassal or below of Chna, this means the EoC will consider you a traitor.
- Cleaned up Khitan settling, seeing as Liao now starts as settled.
- Retired emperors can no longer be given surnames, seeing as that'd mean someone not from the Imperial Family has held the Chrysanthemum Throne.
- Removed the kowtow decisions and events; vanilla's setup is really not good for us, and fixing it now would delay release further. Something kowtow-related will be added at some point in the future; details still TBD.
- Heian-kyo should now become the capital when created by decision.
- Yamashiro should now become Japanese when Heian-kyo is created by decision.
- The Imperial Family should now become Japanese along with the Tenno if the Tenno takes the above decision.

- Added a new artefact decision related to a new artefact potentially discovered at Fredak's lair.
- It is now possible to refound the Luojuzi.
- Eastern Imperial rulers can no longer become the Samrat Chakravartin, bringing them in line with the other Chinese-/Japanese-style governments.
- Shinto Japanese Monastic Feudal characters no longer get to convert between Japanese religions by decision, seeing as that'd result in a government change.
- Limited the ability to convert to Jainism somewhat, seeing as the religion effectively didn't leave India historically.
- Chinese artifact searching is now a bit more widely available, but also a bit more expensive.
- Removed the decisions to create specific Chinese artefacts; it potentially resulted in too many artefacts being around.
- Improved Chinese character decision setup, and made them consistent with Grace/Bloodline character creation.
- It is no longer possible to support a Rising Sun Subjugation when none is being prepared.
- Relevant faction ultimatums have been disabled if the "nuclear option" for dealing with eunuchs/courtiers is currently in effect. This avoids some potential issues.

- Invited commanders are now Japanese Feudal if inviter is Japanese Feudal.
- Added a decision for Yamato/Japanese Pirates/etc. living on the coast to culture swap to Wako.
- Should the Tenno somehow lose Yamashiro to the Shogun he can now retake it by decision.
- Closed loophole where holy orders could get baronies in unwanted places due to building hospitals.
- Members of a Grand Chancellor bloodline can now ask for a spot on their liege's council from their liege in addition to being able to ask a councillor to step aside for them. This should make it a bit more likely that they will end up in a position of power.
- Kejawén rulers can now also change their caste traits.
- No dissolving factions if the Mandate of Heaven has been Lost.
- Monastic Orders with access to province religious conversion decisions no longer get to convert heretic strongholds; likely vanilla oversight, seeing as the modifier would remain in the province.
- Monastic Order religious conversion of provinces now counts for the Strengthen Religion ambition.
- You, too, can now be known for hating the sunlight, should you be a Greek that's overly fond of blinding your prisoners.
- Removed Jurchen troops on special CI empire creation; they're already having an easier time than others.
- Donations, joining, expulsion of holy orders set up.
- The Myrmidons and the Children of Dralha now get the usual pagan HO events and decisions if SoA is installed; likely vanilla oversight.
- Added a knockoff "Create India" decision for Muslims, given their historical attempts to conquer the subcontinent. Requires RoI.
- Added founding decisions for Tianxia's non-Buddhist Eastern HOs.
- Nomads, courtiers in nomadic courts, and characters following a Cosmopolitan or Tolerant religion will no longer go "You can't seduce me; we belong to different religion groups!". Note that the AI doesn't seduce anyone outside its own realm, so this will not make it go even crazier.
- "Japanese enough" and "Chinese enough" characters can now seduce foreigners across religion group borders inside their own "group". Again, it'll not make the AI seduce more people.
- The AI will now check "Do I have *a* compatible spouse/consort"? in seduction logic, as opposed to "Do I have *any incompatible* spouse/consort?", making it a bit less eager to seduce (though Lustful characters are not restricted by this...). Vanilla stupidity.
- AI women will no longer consider a lack of a spouse or consort cause to NOT seduce someone when Homosexual; the risk of having a bastard isn't a factor. Vanilla stupidity.
- Updated tributary breakaway decision to account for the EoC.
- Improved AI Rising Sun Invasion decision logic.
- Various conversion decisions (e.g. "Convert to attacker's religion") can now be taken by Zealous characters if their secret religion matches the religion they're converting to, seeing as that's pretty reasonable. Vanilla oddity (plus consistency improvements).
- The AI now considers moving China's capital on_decade_pulse if from a relevant dynasty, as opposed to checking a decision rather more broadly.
- The Living Flame is now one use only.
- All holy sites now have Protection from Evil (and Protection from Chaos), rendering them impossible to target by the Living Flame.
- Added Pagan GHW unlock decision and announcement event.

- Reclaiming an Imperial Guard regiment now gives you a small MoH boost.
- Fixed incorrect prestige penalties for the GC's preferences when it comes to Tributes/Boons.
- Added decision to pay money to strengthen your religion, seeing as not everyone has access to holy wars or religious liberation wars.

- Imperial Guard regiments can no longer be founded, refounded, raised, or reclaimed in the middle of the "nuclear option".
- Added missing Hellenic secret conversion decision on holy sites.
- The Ainu WL power now also checks the society rank of the would-be concubine/consort if they are in the Ainu WL, meaning higher rank ones will refuse offers from people that either don't have a high ruler tier or a high society tier.
- Opened up LNY eligibility slightly.

# Defines
- Increased the event offsets to 30 (rulers) and 75 (courtiers); helps a bit with performance.

# Disease:
- Increased the outbreak chance of various diseases by 50 %, seeing as we've got roughly 50 % more land provinces than vanilla. Might need further tweaking.
- Updated several patterns to account for geographical region changes not previously accounted for.
- Unless set to "Historical" the Black Death can now spawn in various new and exciting places, spreading Grandfather Nurgle's love more evenly.

- Taiwanese is no longer used as a placeholder for Tenggaran.
- Achenese is no longer used as a placeholder for Malukan.
- Added a bunch of Kadazan-Dusun dynasty names.

- Changed CoAs for some pagans with pre-scripted CoAs to still use the Norse set.
- Updated Hojo mon colour.
- Greatly expanded the Batak surname list (using tribe names).

# Event modifiers
- The LNY dragon boon related to health should now increse your health rather than massively increasing your fertility and having no effect on your health.
- Made the prestige penalty for failing to overthrow your Permanent Regent much harsher.
- Resigning from the council due to not wanting to support the Grand Chancellor/a prospective Grand Chancellor now hurts your monthly prestige a bit more.
- Being forced to adopt a voting pattern by the Grand Chancellor now hurts your monthly prestige a bit more.
- A forced actual regency now lowers defensive plot power, plot discovery chance, and arrest chance. Yes, this means it's an excellent chance to literally stab the Tenno/etc. in the back if he has been getting uppity.
- The MoH now impacts defensive plot power, plot discovery chance, and arrest chance if it's not at Average, being higher with higher MoH and lower with lower. Intersting times should therefore be a bit more interesting.
- Lowered revolt risk increase at Poor and Lost MoH rating; it's more fun if the issues come from existing characters, after all...

# Events
- Many events that previously discriminated against women are now much more open if women are viewed as equal or superior.

- Fixed a bunch of tumbling-related issues; vanilla sure is the gift that keeps giving in that regard...

- Fixed many, many orientation-related issues.
- Several events with implicit tumbling (based off of the event text) now actually come with tumbling.
- Tweaked Iyomante rewards and logic slightly.
- Many events that only could involve your primary wife can now involve other wives if you have polygamy. For example, a secondary wife can catch you with a lover, meaning that imprisoning your primary wife doesn't allow for easy infidelity.

- Fixed some instances where unreformed Tianxia pagans had access to religious features they shouldn't have.
- Northern Court emperors should no longer get renamed if they depose the Southern Court.
- Guests can now get a hangover at the Iyomante even with a middling amount of sake.
- Dharmics that are unlikely to possess elepants no longer gift elepants as part of the Business focus trade route events.

- Gim Daeseong should no longer get an event talking about himself in third person if he goes to Bulguksa.
- Slightly adjusted Bulguksa/Seokguram pilgrimage logic and rewards.

- Paranoid characters receiving Spiritual Guidance to become more Trusting now actually move towards Trusting rather than towards Just.
- You are no longer notified if the person giving you Spiritual Guidance causes you to lose the trait they're supposedly teaching you about, seeing as that'd spoil things.
- It is now possible to lose Drunkard as part of the Hwarang self-reflection events.

- Abandoning the quest to become the Very Best or leaving the WotRS will now result in the event chain ending as soon as reasonable.
- Several WotRS events/decisions will no longer look for members of *any* society when they should look for WotRS members. Many not-at-all suspicious-looking individuals seems particularly releived by this.
- Reworked the WotRS sake drinking contest to be shorter and better.
- Replaced the WotRS poetry contest event chain with an event chain to write a poem, which should not be particularly likely to freeze the game.

- Decreased Hwarang PCS improvement chance event chain likelihood a bit.
- Factions trying to install a new Tenno should no longer go "Let's give him Japan and Yamashiro while the old Tenno keeps everything else, including vassals and the Chrysanthemum Throne, AND becomes independent!"
- Permanent Regents are now checked roughly every month, instead of every instance of anyone getting a regent checking if there should be a different regent.
- If the Tenno dies without a dynastic heir (and it hasn't happened before), k_chrysanthemum_throne and any held empires and kingdoms are immediately destroyed and Shinto MA is hurt massively.
- Cleaned up old events related to Japanese government stuff that no longer are relevant.
- Restructured still relevant Japanese government events.
- Reworked Japanese government trait inheritance so that all unlanded children (of an appropriate gender) of a title holder that are eligible inherits the trait.
- Characters being landed (in any fashion) by someone with Japanese Feudal/Japanese Monastic Feudal that'd be eligible for that government now get the option to swap to the that government.
- Characters usurping a new higher tier title from someone with Japanese Feudal/Japanese Monastic Feudal that'd be eligible for that government now get the option to swap to the that government.
- Characters inheriting a new higher tier title from someone with Japanese Feudal/Japanese Monastic Feudal that'd be eligible for that government now get the option to swap to the that government.
- If the Shogun, Shogun's PR, Tenno's PR, or Ryukyuan knockoff's PR receives a request for land for a son/daughter they can now take a title off of other relevant parties (with special protection for c_yamashiro if it's held by the Tenno).
- Significantly improved the regnal name selection for the Tenno.
- Told the AI it can't transfer the PR under another vassal as it apparently was clever enough to come up with that.
- The EoC no longer receives a bunch of free JD artefacts.
- Taoists now have a slightly harder time converting Confucian provinces, and vice versa.
- The repeating event handling setting up proper Permanent Regents should now also force them back under the proper liege if relevant. You thought you were so clever...
- The Permanent Regent should once more auto-create the Regency Loyalists whenever they gain the Regent minor title, and their AI dynasty members should auto-join the faction if appropriate.

- Closed a loophole allowing skilled female would-be councillors to fire the GC/PR. The GC/PR isn't just being sexist; they're keeping their Son of Heaven-given authority.

- HF.42028 can now potentially actually result in pregnancy, as implied, as can one earlier event in the chain.

- Hopefully fixed vanilla stupidity where dying due to an execution reason -- say due to being impaled as a Devil Worshipper -- with nokiller resulted in getting an execution nickname. Thus ends the tale of Tenno I will be known as Buretsu! 'the Tennoslayer', first of his name!
- Sleeping with your wife should no longer result in her becoming pregnant with a bastard; silly vanilla event fix.

- Fixed some issues with WotRS members ranking up when they shouldn't be eligible to.
- Fixed incorrect vanilla "religion_group = indian_group" pre-trigger for several guru events; the trigger indicates Bön rulers are supposed to be able to get the events, and those are pagan...

- Wako characters can now pick up the Pirate trait and its upgrades from raiding even if non-pagan and lacking a pirate bloodline.
- Commented out achievement-related on_action events; they're just a waste of performance, and every little bit helps.

- MoH revolters that become CI after the war now get some levy reinforcements and some additional event troops.

- Added sanity checks for agnatic/enatic trait inheritance (Sayyid (+ Mirza), Saoshyant Descendant, Amaterasu Descendant) when set_father/set_mother is triggered; traits match perceived father/mother, as in the case of a hidden bastard.
- Added santiy check on Jimmu's bloodline inheritance, inheritance of other Imperial Family bloodlines, inheritance of Divine Ancestry bloodlines, and inheritance of Confucius' bloodline when set_father/set_mother is triggered (matching perceived parents).

- Fixed AI logic for some Tributes/Boons.
- Expanded on what can happen when visiting a port on the Treasure Fleet's voyage.

- Sex is no longer considered compatible with Celibacy.
- Added missing trait notification events.
- Told ascetics that get land to stop being landed (unless independent), not stop being ascetics. Workaround for the AI's annoying tendency to somehow land (Fujiwara) Kakuen, among others.
- Being part of a realm along the Silk Road no longer automatically subscribes you to the Mandate Updates newsletter.
- Claims are no longer handed out when the Tenno/knockoff take a title from someone by decision (or event, in the AI's case); the Shogun deciding to revoke the title is undesirable.

- SRS communities matching the public religion of a province now get cleaned up on_yearly_pulse.
- Fixed some Hwarang and WotRS rank up issues caused by MNM.

- Selling titles to merchants now hurts your MoH rating. Everyone knows merchants are unproductive members of society!
- Tweaked event 65001's loc a bit (it could contextually be nonsensical) and also opened it up to women; there was no good reason to block it.
- Event 65003 can now fire for women; there was no good reason to block it.
- Event 65007 can now fire for women; there was no good reason to block it.

- Event 89014 and following events now check for Open Succession.
- Event 89014 and following events no longer assumes that the heir should be male.
- Yazidis no longer speak of the Prophet in WoL.7080; vanilla's decision to make them part of the Muslim group sure causes issues...
- HF.15122, which involves ROOT "getting rid" of some people in an event option, now arranges "unfortunate accidents", as opposed to having the people in question die in actual accidents.

- The Treasure Fleet now loses assorted things (e.g. supplies) when taking notable damage in events (e.g. when sailing through a storm).
- The Treasure Fleet now loses more supplies when sailing from one location to the next; should make it a bit less likely that the Treasure Fleet can sail extremely far.

- Event 3040 no longer makes assumptions regarding the involved characters' opinions as to the consumption of wine, pork, or meat in general.

- Event 3145 is now more sane with regards to whether ROOT is married or not.
- Event 3145 can now partially move you towards Groomed.
- Event 3185 is now more consistent when it comes to gender, as opposed to assuming a male courtier and never bothering to check that the randomly selected courtier is male.
- Event 3203 now only fires if religions are standard, seing as St. Paul can't be assumed to be a thing otherwise.
- Event 3205 no longer has gender restrictions, seeing as they didn't really make sense.
- Event 3550 no longer randomly causes loss of Scholar, instead causing a definite loss of prestige.

- Event 3655 now remembers to check job_titles.
- Event 3690 now selects the appropriate spouse, and only fires when they are a sane spouse.
- Event 3755 no longer fires with random religions, seeing as the whole "Islam" thing isn't a thing them.
- A number of event requiring opinion >= 100 now require opinion >= 75, seeing as the former is pretty unreasonable most of the time.
- Event 1985 no longer has its second option, and should NOT have it.
- ZE.13610 is now saner.
- ZE.13700 is now saner, and ZE.13702 has been changed to work with it.

- Satanic orgies are now a bit more sensibly coded. A bit.
- Ancestor worship is now saner when it comes to attraction triggers.
- Celibate wives should no longer cheat on their spouse with the justification "We don't have children because my husband is infertile!".
- Wives should no longer cheat on their husbands over "suspected infertility" if said husband is Celibate (you've not even tried) or a eunuch (you know what the problem is).
- Underage characters are no longer invited to... "parties" during the coronation event chain; serious vanilla oversight!

- If men aren't allowed to fight they will also not be around to be handsome guards to tumble.
- It is now possible for homosexual characters to make friends (and get lovers) in an MO.
- MOs no longer cause heterosexual characters to change their orientation; they will instead only get the opportunity to become lovers with someone that they aleady are attracted to.
- While Lucifer does not frown on homosexuality, he also recognizes the problematic nature of vanilla event 6225. It has been excised with prejudce.
- Lucifer and off-brand counterparts have likewise recognized that DW orgies were set up in a problematic manner. This problem has also been excised with prejudce.
- DW orgies no longer make explicit references to Hell or succubi, seeing as those might not make sense in a bunch of places.
- Sleeping with a prostitute while on a crusade and making them your lover has the same effect on your traits as sleeping with them but not making them your lover.
- SRS lover events now check attraction from both directions, as opposed to only checking it from one direction.
- The Saoshyant decision now checks for geographical regions.
- Lieges in no position to mess with non-mourning vassals (e.g. due to being imprisoned) no longer get imprisonment or revoke reasons.
- Lowered the duration of imprisonment and revoke reasons caused by failed mourning; yes, it's bad to not mourn, but this makes more sense with delayed mourning and pestering people who haven't gotten around to it.
- Improved AI mourning logic; it will no longer care about a too strong liege if said liege doesn't care about mourning in the first place, for one thing.
- Increased the cost of necromantic rituals substantially, but improved the reward of successful ones.
- If an ancestor dies and you have a valid excuse to not mourn them right away (e.g. being at war) you'll now be expected to mourn them at a later time.
- Rulers that have failed to mourn an ancestor will now get a stacking negative modifier, cleared when mourning starts.
- If you are already mourning an ancestor and another ancestor you mourn dies, the current period of mourning will be extended, counting days/years from when the latest ancestor died. End date might be delayed slightly, for ease of scripting.
- Added negative events for those that keep putting off mourning without an excuse.
- Added decision to mourn ancestors you've failed to mourn before, assuming you've not decreed that you won't mourn them. The amount of time you are expected to mourn is increased to the level above the one you'd be expected to mourn if you had mourned right away, should it be shorter than the full three years.
- If a vassal of yours has failed to mourn properly due to having an excuse at the time but does not currently have one, you may now get an event about telling them to get to it. This, too, will force a somewhat longer mourning period if they accept, and carry the harshest penalty for refusal.
- HL.10610 and its follow-ups have been disabled; children will inherit the mercenary bloodline from their parent, so no need for them to get a modifier.
- The Demon Child will no longer attempt to start the Sunset Invasion if they're very far from the Atlantic.
- RIP.12057 (sneaky infiltrator attempts to murder host) now looks at PCS rather than Martial; you're trying to defend yourself, not lead an army!

- RIP.29806 now behaves more like RoI.10001.
- Added announcement events for Imperial Guard regiments being (re)founded.

- Updated a couple of early vanilla events that used Martial to use PCS as they are about duels.
- Event 64120 now checks for an opinion modifier, meaning that if a character remarries after making their spouse's affair public they can make their new spouse's affair public.
- Set up inheritance/usurpation/etc. handling of certain Tianxia artefacts (e.g. the Heirloom Seal of the Realm) that should follow a certain title.

- Attempted to salvage the nonsense that is the "logic" for base_regency_events.txt (atrocious vanilla file).
- Corrected spelling of Shravanabelagola in several flags.

- The EoC once more gets a negative opinion modifier towards anyone that dares attack the Treasure Fleet.
- The TF events now take the EoC's view on gender into account when spawning certain characters.
- Cosmopolitan and Tolerant pagans will no longer get to burn down tribal pillars, seeing as religious tolerance is kind of their thing.
- Lovers in seclusion now marry in a fashion beneficial for their liege, if possible.
- Disobedient daughters will now matri-marry when possible. After all, you're letting them marry the man of their choice, so ruining your dynasty is not *as* important.
- Added proper recruit/revival scores for the Hwarang and the WotRS.
- Events 94098 and 94099 are now restricted to Christian, Muslim, and Zoroastrian rulers, seeing as they make little sense for others.
- Disabled "Drunken Warrior" event chain (starting with event 94010); it makes little sense with the Far East on the map.
- ambition.006 now gives PCS rather than Martial; vanilla forgot to update the event for the duel rework...
- Improved logic in WoL.10102.
- Set up RW holy order creation and grandmaster gender... not that we support it.
- The Jomsvikings now spawn when assorted GHWs unlock around 1100 in RWs with random religions, as opposed to never spawning.
- The Cluny and Mount Athos events are now tied to global flags, seeing as those communities shouldn't magically appear in certain years.
- The Cadaver Synod now only happens once, and only if the historical one hasn't happened.
- Hungarian raiding adventurers no longer magically stop being a thing when the year 1066 comes around if you start before that year, but won't go raiding if you start in 1066 or later.
- WotRS members can now potentially contemplate flipping to Japanese culture during the Very Best event chain as soon as Heian-kyo has been founded.
- The Shahnameh is no longer tied to a magical year; it is instead tied to a global flag.
- Crusader knights can now show up at coronations before year 1100 if the Crusades have started.
- Disabled the "Ars Morendi" event, seeing as the book might not be written in a certain timeline and as it does pretty weird direct health damage.
- The Viking Age can now start as early as 793, seeing as there was a pretty famous raid at a little place known as Lindisfarne that year.
- The "Nuclear option", the Gut, and all Tianxia feasts now set and clear do_not_disturb as they should.
- Aachen is only impressive for the Mongols to sack if you start after 786, seeing as Charlie's palace was constructed after that point and that's what's being referenced.

- Updated a number of focus events to not involve inaccessible characters.

- Telling your liege that you won't mourn when approached at a later time now clears the stacking failure_to_mourn modifier as you'll have a bunch of other negatives to concern yourself with.
- Blatantly refusing to mourn now makes your council discontent, in addition to various earlier effects. May you live in interesting times!
- The EoC will now consider being an unfilial descendant cause to refuse some Grace-related things.
- The Tenno now has an unlimited supply of Get Out Of Jail Free cards and diplomatic_immunity = yes, though only if his liege or jailer (as appropriate) should care.
- If the Tenno is the primary participant in a war and gets imprisoned by the other side, the Get Out Of Jail Free Card is slightly less free, coming with a "The Tenno first surrenders" clause.
- Added a workaround to handle the AI EoC (and potentially other CI rulers) going way above his demesne limit and staying there for no good reason, making China less prone to imploding due to AI insanity.
- Dynasty members of CI rulers and the Tenno should no longer wind up in silly courts when starting a new game.
- Burninating provinces with extreme prejudice is now even more unwise.
- The Sword of Two Minds might now have an effect on your traits.
- Sanity's Demise's influence is now a touch more subtle... at first...

- The Vial of Immortality now has a confirmation event.

- Protection from Claim Fabrication only works for the Pope if the would-be-fabricator's liege actually thinks the Pope is someone to listen to, as opposed to always.
- Holy orders are now less picky about their castles' locations when using a Random World (not that we currently support them...).
- The Treasure Fleet can now experience "fun" when visiting places with epidemics.
- Local rulers now refuse to invite Treasure Fleet members to parties if said member is suffering from an epidemic.
- Various Imperial Guard forces now stand down if the EoC stops being CI (including the case where the former EoC gets overthrown and then creates a pretender right away).
- Raiding adventurers' commanders' gender now depends on their Doctrines.
- Chinese mourners with a Sympathy trait for the religion of the ancestor they're mourning will no longer get events about becoming sympathetic.
- Added pacifists_lose_piety_effect = yes to a bunch of Tianxia events that needed it.
- Improved extra pregnancy chance event for CI/JI/DI.
- Set up tags for Mass Conversion event loc for Bön and all Tianxia pagans (Tianxia's Eastern religions never Mass Convert).
- Modified the event text of TOG.3205 and opened it up to women.
- Thomas of Aquinas is no longer assumed to do his thing if the game starts before 1256.
- The outcome of the "nuclear option" in any barbarian kingdoms or pretender empires no longer has any effect on Imperial Guard regiments' existence or the eunuchs' control thereof. Both the Son of Heaven and the Council Eunuchs agreed to close this loophole.
- Should you attack the Treasure Fleet and successfully destroy all remaining ships you may now opt to inform your soldiers and the world that there were no survivours... not that anyone will buy it...
- The "I'm getting stressed out about my many lovers" now checks that a sufficient amount of them aren't imprisoned, as opposed to possibly stressing you out over a single non-imprisoned lover and only letting you break things off with them.
- Heretic and religious revolts now spawn leaders based on temple holder gender, seeing as they're led by "a charismatic [GetPriestTitle]".
- Set up creation of reformer artefacts.
- Set up tranfer of reformer artefacts.
- Set up adding of traits for dead reformer artefact traits.
- Prosperity can now only result in a centre of worship if you share the province's religion; might be something to open up a bit, but it should certainly not be possible with *any* province religion.
- Looted duplicate artefacts are now destroyed even if indestructible; clearly, they were fake!
- Dynastic close relatives in the court of a higher tier character are now less prone to random religious conversion.

# Factions
- Made it impossible to scheme/use your spymaster to force the Permanent Regent's dynasty members out of the Regency Loyalists faction.
- Made it impossible to block the Tenno from starting or remaining in the faction to depose the Shogun using scheming/spymasters.
- None of the Japanese factions (for becoming the permanent regent (either kind), being a regency loyalist (either kind), becoming the shogun, or ousting the shogun) are now blocked for council members.
- The faction to become the permanent regent now requires the prospective faction leader to be a king, be a duke with 1000 prestige and a regency bloodline, or be a duke with 5000 prestige (comparable to the Shogunate faction's conditions) unless the liege already has a non-permanent regent. The faction leader gets to stay in charge if the regency ends.
- Made the AI less willing to start a faction to give the Shogun a Permanent Regent unless they have an active Regency bloodline, and also made it less willing to back such a faction unless the faction leader has such a bloodline, seeing as the Ashikaga Shoguns shouldn't have to be overly concerned about this threat. This does not apply if the Shogun already has a regent.
- Updated relevant faction logic to let unreformed/sensibly reformed Ryukyuans join the fun that is the Japanese government faction mess. A Tenno knockoff cannot join the fun, but he can be the target of some of the fun.
- Vassals that'd hypothetically be eligible for Chinese Imperial will now not start factions to put women on the throne of a Chinese Imperial empire if the title is Agnatic unless they happen to be female, and will also be unwilling to back female claimants. You're supposed to faction for their male children; silly AI!
- It is no longer possible to start or join claimant factions against the Tenno if you are someone that cares about the Tenno, or to start them on behalf of someone that cares about the Tenno... unless it's for some kingdom (other than k_chrysanthemum_throne) he holds and he also holds an emperor-tier title. In that case, still no claiming it for members of the Tenno's dynasty. If you are someone that cares about the Tenno, you'll have to use the Shogunate faction if you want to take his empire title (or you can become the Permanent Regent, if you prefer a less direct approach) and you're not from his dynasty. If you're from his dynasty, well, see below.
- Made the AI very unwilling to support claimants that'd switch the realm from assorted eastern governments to other kinds of feudalism if they can have one of those assorted governments, particularly within subgroups (e.g. a character with Japanese Bureaucracy will be more concerned about a Japanese Feudal liege being replaced by someone that'd have regular Feudal than they'd be about a Chinese Imperial liege being replaced by a regular Feudal liege), as well as the opposite way around.
- Chinese and Japanese viceroys no longer consider "I am a viceroy!" a reason to be more eager to seek independence if their liege has a government they approve of (Chinese Imperial in the former case, Japanese/Divine Imperial in the latter).
- The AI should now be considerably less likely to seek independence if their liege has a Permanent Regent if it cares about such things and is a de jure vassal.
- AI Japanese Bureaucracy/Feudal/Monastic Feudal de jure vassals should not seek independence from a Shogun if they instead could restore the Tenno's rule.
- AI Japanese Bureaucracy/Feudal/Monastic Feudal de jure vassals should not seek independence from the Tenno if they could become the Shogun.
- AI Confucian Bureaucracy viceroys are now less likely to seek independence under a Chinese Imperial liege unless the Mandate rating of the liege drops below Average unless they also have non-viceroy titles of the same tier.
- The AI Tenno shouldn't ever seek independence if under a Japanese Bureaucracy/Feudal/Monastic Feudal liege; overthrowing the Shogunate is obviously better.
- If the Mandate rating of a liege drops to Lost
- Added new faction to press de facto claims of valid Imperial Family members on the Chrysanthemum Throne.
- The Tenno is no longer blocked from the End Shogunate faction by having a regent, but an actual regency is still a blocker.
- The AI is now more likely to join the Regency Loyalists if the Permanent Regent has managed to shift the Regency Power laws far in his favour. Confucian Bureaucracy vassals will become more eager to seek independence.
- Further lowered Confucian Bureaucracy Independence faction willingness against someone with a positive MoH.
- The "The Three Mountains" Doctrine now makes co-religionist vassals much more likely to seek independence.
- The "The Three Mountains" Doctrine now makes co-religionist vassals much more likely to start/join factions for their own claims.
- Vassals following a religion with the "The Three Mountains" Doctrine that have a liege with the same religion can now start and join factions even if on the council.
- The Grand Chancellor can now join the Claimant, Independence, and Takeover factions even if on the council.
- Non-Imperial Family WotRS members are now more likely to start and join the Shogunate faction, though the Master is less likely to support someone else's attempt to become the Shogun.
- Non-Imperial Family WotRS members are now less likely to start and join the End Shogunate faction, though the Master is more likely to help destroy it so that they can create a new, improved Shogunate of their own.
- The Powerful Vassal Takeover Faction now results in abdication to the faction leader rather than the most liked vassal if both the liege and the vassal has a Chinese- or Japanese-style government (Note: As in vanilla, this faction is not available against rel heads).
- The Grand Chancellor is now more likely to start the Takeover faction.
- Significantly increased the AI opinion thresholds for leaving various Japanese factions, and increased the severity of low opinion on the AI's willingness to start/join those factions.
- Significantly reduced the prestige requirement for starting the Permanent Regency factions.
- Made the AI care less about the opinion of their liege for the Takeover Faction if the liege has a sub-Average MoH rating.
- Made AI Grand Chancellors willing to join the Takeover Faction against their liege at significantly higher opinion.
- The AI is no longer more eager to faction against their own dynasty just because the dynasty has a sub-Average MoH rating; obviously, you want to overthrow the ruler, not the dynasty!
- Told the AI that revolting to put a member of their Chinese Imperial liege's dynasty on the Dragon Throne (or pretender knockoff) is perhaps not something it should try to do unless from the same dynasty; you want to overthrow the dynasty, not the ruler!
- Told AI ConBu rulers not to try to seek independence fromn a CI liege from the same dynasty. Just overthrow them!
- Told AI ConBu rulers that overthrowing their liege's CI dynasty probably is better than seeking independence if there's already a faction seeking to overthrow the ruler.
- Told AI ConBu rulers of the same dynasty and culture as a CI/ConBu/EI liege to maybe not seek independence so often. Take over the realm from within!
- Told AI JI/DI/JBu/JFeudal/JMonFeudal rulers of the same dynasty and culture as a JI/DI/JBu/JFeudal/JMonFeudal liege to maybe not seek independence so often. Take over the realm from within!
- Told AI dynasty members of CI/ConBu/EI or JI/DI/JBu/JFeudal/JMonFeudal from the same subset to not support Takeover factions led by other dynasties very often, seeing as that'd result in their dynasty losing power. Obviously, you should be the new ruler!
- Told the AI not to support non-dynastic Former Sons/Daughters of Heaven leading Claimant or Takeover factions as often.
- The AI will no longer back the Takeover faction against a CI/ConBu/EI liege if it's eligible for one of those governments and has a claim, seeing at should want to be the new ruler.
- Tightened Independence faction requirements for people that should care about the Tenno or the knockoff.
- Non-Japanese Feudal AIs should now be less into the creation of Shogunates.
- Told the AI that the Imperial Claimant faction is maybe not something to start quite so frequently if you're not the Imperial Claimant in question.
- Increased Claimant Faction chance against CI rulers that are perceived as tyrants.
- Vassals of a CI liege are now only allowed to start the Takeover faction if one of the following is true: You are the Grand Chancellor and your influence is Overwhelming, you are a Powerful Vassal and your influence is Overwhelming, or your liege has Lost the MoH. This should make Poor MoH more likely to be "Vassals fight each other while trying to become strong enough to make a play for the Dragon Throne (or pretender equivalent)" as opposed to "Vassals quickly make a play for the Dragon Throne (or pretender equivalent), making the Pacification CB effectively irrelevant".
- The Independence faction is no longer unlocked for all vassals of CI realms at Poor MoH, though the restrictions on councillors joining the faction are revoked at that point. The goal is to promote infighting rather than disintegration at this stage.
- Rulers that are mourning can no longer be part of any factions.
- Extended the independence faction logic for k_orthodox to k_hellenic_pagan (provided it is a theocracy), meaning the Pontifex Maximus won't be ungrateful and turn against the Augustus.

# Focuses
- Adjusted AI focus logic slightly for a few of our governments.
- The AI is now more likely to pick non-martial education focuses if a bureaucracy.
- Adjusted AI childhood focus logic for bureaucracies.
- Made the AI smarter about the Faith and Heritage focuses and Chinese/Japanese government eligibility.
- AI rulers with a Chinese/Japanese government will now be less likely to pick the Business focus. Merchants are lowly people that don't contribute to society, after all.
- The Ryukyuan knockoff and their Permanent Regent is now as likely to pick the Intrigue focus as the Tenno/etc.
- Koshin characters are now a bit more likely to pick the Carousing focus.
- Celibate mourners are no longer allowed to use the Seduction focus.

# Game rules
- Deleted the culture game rule for Chinese Imperial, seeing as it was causing way too many problems. It will NOT be returning.
- Removed the game rule related to the "Confucian Principles" Doctrine since the requirements for the required religion have changed considerably and said Doctrine no longer exists.

- Added a game rule to let pagans start their GHWs before the Crusades and/or Jihads start.
- Added a game rule to give pagans the opportunity to feudalize (or become an MR, if you insist on using that hardcoded mess...) prior to reformation.
- Removed duchy and kingdom creation restriction game rules; they're mostly controlled by Chinese laws now.
- Added a game rule to disable the Nomad Subjugation CB, seeing as it's a balance nightmare.
- Added a Holy War range game rule, potentially preventing early ovearses holy wars.
- Added an Interesting Muslims game rule, making it possible to disable those due to their relation to Sacred Timeline history.
- Added a Manifest Destiny game rule, making it possible to disable the Manifest Destiny Invasion CB as it is railroady. Perhaps Seljuk and Timur should get Tribal invasion from their bloodlines...?
- Added a game rule to limit Indian Subjugation targets by culture/religion.
- Added a game rule to limit Indian Subjugation range.

# Governments
- Removed inherent monthly piety from Chinese Imperial, Japanese Imperial, and Japanese Monastic Feudal.
- Lowered the amount of concubines for Chinese Imperial and Japanese Imperial to 100.
- Lowered the extra court size for Chinese Imperial and Japanese Imperial to 500.
- Dynasty members of Chinese Imperial emperors no longer get Chinese Imperial (unless they happen to control another Chinese Imperial empire).
- Overhauled Chinese Imperial eligibility.
- Japanese Imperial no longer accepts any liege governments, which should make the Tenno a bit less likely to decide that this Shogunate thing isn't so bad...
- The Tenno can no longer freely revoke duchies, making it harder to deal with duke vassals that swap to Japanese Feudal or Japanese Monastic Feudal.
- Added Eastern Imperial government.
- Overhauled Confucian Bureaucracy (chinese_vassal_government) eligibility.
- Added Japanese Bureaucracy government.
- Overhauled Japanese Feudal eligibility.
- Overhauled Japanese Monastic Feudal eligibility.
- Added Divine Imperial government.
- Changed government colours for Chinese Imperial and Nomadic.
- Updated the colour of the Japanese Imperial and Japanese Feudal governments to better match the colours of the icons/frames.
- Imperial (roman_imperial_government) is no longer an option for anyone that'd be eligible for any of the assorted eastern governments. This prevents certain weird scenarios that'd potentially cause a government switch, e.g. a character eligible for Japanese Bureaucracy being Imperial one moment and losing it the next because a vassal happened to inherit the Chrysanthemum Throne.
- Chinese, Eastern, Japanese, and Divine Imperial now have an inherent +10 vassal opinion to balance out the -10 vassal opinion they suffer from being locked into Imperial Administration.
- Unreformed and Reformed Bön now gives you Monastic Feudal regardless of culture, which should make the religion a bit more interesting with unconventional cultures.
- Bamar culture no longer unlocks Monatic Feudal for Buddhists, seeing as that goverment isn't a great fit for Bagan/etc.
- The Confucian and Japanese Bureaucracy goverments no longer have cities as preferred holdings (they are still allowed to hold them without penalties) to hopefully keep the AI from doing some stupid things.
- The various Chinese and Japanese governments can no longer hold tribal holdings without penalty even with matching culture.
- Japanese Feudal now gets opinion penalties for raised levies.
- Japanese Monastic Feudal no longer get to freely revoke titles from lots of governments.
- Removed the ability to freely revoke titles from wrong religion tribal rulers for all Chinese- and Japanese-style governments.
- Characters eligible for Chinese Imperial, Confucian Bureaucracy, Eastern Imperial, Japanese Imperial, Japanese Bureaucracy, and Divine Imperial should now be less likely to randomly become republics, MR or otherwise.
- Characters eligible for Monastic Feudal, Japanese Imperial, Japanese Monastic Feudal, and Divine Imperial shouldnow be less likely to randomly become theocracies.
- The Sapa Inca can now technically be tribal without HF.
- Chinese Imperial rulers no longer allow matrilineal marriages if Agnatic, which should help mitigate some AI stupidity. Considering Imperial Marriages are a thing, they don't really benefit from having them available if China (and if not China, they obviously want to be China).

# Grace system
- Grace penalties now only check for the EoC and his close dynastic relatives (and his dynastic heir and/or dynastic children, in a handful of places), which should help with performance since the third (and most expensive) any_dynasty_member check now is gone in a lot of places.
- Several things that previously resulted in Grace penalties no longer matter. Yes, the EoC might be unhappy if you e.g. break up with him, but as far as China's government is concerned you're not in the wrong.
- General: Vassals of China can now use a number of Grace interactions.
- General: Pretender tributaries can no longer use the Grace system.
- General: Aside from vassals and below of China, the Grace system is now restricted to independent rulers, king-tier vassals, Grand Chancellors, Permanent Regents, and powerful vassals of independent rulers. China does not concern itself with barbarian nobodies.
- General: The EoC can no longer accept Tributes or grant Boons if inaccessible or incapable.
- General: If you are inaccessible or have a regent (including a Permanent Regent) you are now unable to use the Grace system.
- General: The game rule for disabling the Grace system is no longer available. The game rule for Imperial Marriages remains.
- General: The EoC can no longer enable or disable specific Tributes or Boons. They can still be refused, but that comes with an MoH penalty.
- General: The AI now handles Grace decisions with offset on_x_pulse events, improving performance.
- General: The Chinese influence group laws now impact what happens when a Tribute arrives or a Boon is requested, potentially making things less nice for the EoC and more nice for others.
- General: Various logic overhauls.
- General: Cleaned up irrelevant logic.
- General: The EoC's Mandate rating now affects the Grace gained for different Tributes; if the Mandate rating is high, the Grace gain is lower, while if the Mandate rating is low the Grace gain is higher.
- General: The AI is now more likely to offer more powerful Tributes if the EoC's Mandate rating is higher.
- General: Characters sent to China will no longer accept court invites. You thought you were so clever...
- General: The EoC re-gifting a Tribute now gives the full amount of Grace.
- General: Only half your Grace (if positive; it's already only 10 % if negative) can be inherited.
- General: Pretender emperors no longer lose most of their negative Grace on inheritance.
- General: Vassals of China now receive some Grace (scaled by tier) on_yearly_pulse.
- General: Rebalanced yearly Grace income for tributaries; title tier now matters quite a bit.
- General: Grace loss for usurpation now scales with title tier; emperor/king/rel head title > non-rel head duke title > county, baronies don't count.

- Offer Eunuch: You can no longer send the EoC's dynasty members as eunuchs. China would certainly not approve.
- Offer Eunuch: "Loyal Servant" eunuchs gotten from the eunuch merchant can now be sent to China. They do of course remain loyal servants of the sender...
- Offer Eunuch: Your own unlanded prisoners can now be sent as eunuchs to China.
- Offer Eunuch: You can now send pretty terrible eunuchs to China even if they are not from your dynasty, though the Grace you get for them will probably leave something to be desired.
- Offer Eunuch: China will no longer re-gift eunuchs.
- Offer Concubine: Is now available for vassals and below of China.
- Offer Concubine: If you are someone that should care, you cannot send members of the Imperial Family or the family of the Ryukyuan knockoff.
- Offer Concubine: You can no longer send siblings, ancestors, or descendants of the EoC as concubines.
- Offer Concubine: Beautiful women can now be sent even if they're not related to anyone powerful.

- Offer Artifact: Extended the protection on the Imperial Regalia to all characters that should care.
- Offer Artifact: If the EoC is a member of the Hermetics, you can now send ingredients as Tribute.

Transfers one prosperity level from a random (ideally non-capital) demesne province to the EoC's choice of his capital (if not Booming), a random demesne province (if any are not Booming, preferring Depopulated provinces), or a random (preferably non-tribal) realm province not in the sender's demesne.
- Transfer Society Currency: New Tribute, available if in the same society as the EoC. Transfer 1000 society currency to the EoC in exchange for Grace.

- Request County: New Boon, available for feudal (is_feudal = yes) vassals and below of China. Spend Grace to request that the EoC gives you another county. The EoC will potentially give you one from a vassal or below instead, if any have multiple valid counties and vassals are not too powerful. The EoC will be expected to compensate the vassal in some manner.
- Request County: The EoC's GC pays less Grace.
- Request County for Other: New Boon, available for feudal (is_feudal = yes) vassals and below of China. Spend Grace to request that the EoC gives a county to an unlanded kinsman/close relative/friend/lover of yours.

- Many Roman Emperors now have proper nicknames (including Constantinius ("Constantine") the Great, whose nickname vanilla apparently skipped despite it being a pretty standard one...) and death reasons.
- Shapur I knows what he did... and perhaps people will be able to emulate him...
- Vespasian has one of the more unique "death" reasons, as he should.
- Handed out more Zhangokfutous.
- Song's MoH rating is now properly set towards the end in the history files. Interesting times...
- Handed out laurels that vanilla saw fit to skip for some unfathomable reason.
- Latinized/Grecified many Roman emperors' names, e.g. Trajan -> Trajanus. Caligula, Carcalla, and a few more keep their nicknames, seeing as those are rather more well known than their proper names.
- The Nicene emperors are now supposed to be legitimate following the historical recreation of e_byzantium; regnal numbers get screwed up otherwise. Unfortunately not working.
- immortal_age has now been set for some characters with fudged BCE dates. Sadly, their portraits do not appear to have changed to display their proper age.
- While Taizu of Song was militarily gifted, he is no longer considered to have been both a Skilled Tactician and a Brilliant Strategist.
- Minor improvements to EREmperors.
- Taizong and Gaozong of Tang are no longer born as Kinslayers, instead becoming Kinslayers when they historically engaged in kinslaying.
- Andronikos I "Misophaes" is now a Dynastic Kinslayer; he knows what he did.
- Imperial Diadems added where needed.
- EREmperors' nicknames added where needed.
- Fixed incorrect death dates for several Kaisers; what's up with that, vanilla? This includes one playable Kaiser (Barbarossa) during a selectable start date, leaving e_hre without a living holder for a bit prior to this fix...
- Not holy, not Roman, not emperors starting from Otto the Great now get their crowns (when dead, assuming they died as emperors) and crowned_by_x (usually x = Pope, but the Arch-Salian was crowned by an Antipope...) traits, where applicable (crowned as emperors, not during the Great Interregnum). Ludwig the Bavarian does not get one, seeing as there's no "Crowned by Senator" trait.
- Otto the Red, Friedrich Barbarossa, and Ludwig the Bavarian now have their nicknames.- Reverted Octavianus to Augustus; by acknowledging that he was just the first citizen, both "Augustus Augustus" and "Octavianus Octavianus" can be avoided.
- Diocletianus is now properly the Dominus.
- Tenno Shotoku no longer forgets that she's the Tenno while alive.
- Princess Pingchang is now a special_marshal; she's also very dead, but it's the thought that counts!

- Improved on some deaths; Wang Jipeng and others know what they did!
- Corrected vanilla typo in Raigbagh Khan's name.
- Fujiwara Yorinaga and Fujiwara Narichika are now each other's lovers, and have had their traits adjusted.
- Minor Mongol history tweaks concerning Güyük, Temüge, and the latter's descendants.
- Adjusted province ownership and setup to account for Liao being settled, as well as later events.
- Yang Guifei is now somwhat plumper (not that she's alive at any playable date...).

# Interface
- Fixed the Tenno not counting as an emperor in some places in the portrait properties if he doesn't hold an empire-tier title. He is obviously always the emperor!
- Buddhist members of the Fellowship of the Kami now use the society clothes worn by members of the regular Buddhist MO under the same conditions as someone in the regular Buddhist MO would.
- The Mongol Empire, the Golden Horde, the Ilkhanate, Chagatai, and the Timurids now use the Tengri/Nomad empire frames at all times.
- Modified the bloodline interface to make it possible to have more effects without overflow.
- Modified the bloodline interface to make it possible to have a longer desc.
- Improved event picture setup.

# Job titles and actions
- Tidied up requirements and moved stuff to scripted_triggers.
- Made it impossible for people that should care to use their chancellor to fabricate claims on the Tenno or the Ryukyuan knockoff.

- Changed the title colours for e_vietnam and its de jure to be less similar to the colour used for e_khmer.
- Reordered the de jure vassals of e_japan a bit so that d_rokuhara hopefully takes precedence over other Fujiwara-held duchies as far as title naming goes.
- k_chrysanthemum_throne is now even more difficult to recreate, because you shouldn't ever need to.
- If a religion has been reformed with Divine Ancestry you now need to be a member of the relevant bloodline to recreate the title if it is destroyed.
- Baekje is now known as "Kudara" if held by a Yamato/Japanese/Wako ruler.
- Moved k_dali into e_china, to encourage both sides to take an interest in one another (and to make holding k_dali help with recreating e_china, if relevant).
- Added a large number of titular empires for use by CI dynasties when they're not using a de jure title.
- Added and adjusted many holy sites.
- The Children of the Light have had their colour updated.
- Moved the Buddhist holy site in Bamiyan to Gyeongju (Bulguksa) to make the Far East capable of affecting Buddhist MA.
- Added new k_amdo and restructured k_xixia. Taken together, this should result in (Xi) Xia working better due to not getting liberation revolts and China having more of an interest in Jiuquan.
- Added new k_minangkabau in Nusantara.
- Added new k_madjaas in the Pacific Rim.
- Moved Inca holy site from Dakhina Desa to Lhasa. They do like their mountains...
- k_sukhothai is now de jure part of the Khmer Empire.
- Added the Luojuzi.
- Adjusted holy sites of some pagans.

- Added a capital for e_india; Magadha (site of Patna/Pataliputra, capital of the Maruya Empire).
- Added/revised crusade weights for our pagans + Bön, revised Tengri crusade weights.
- e_byzantium now uses basic emperor titles; it changes nothing for Greeks, fixes Romans, and avoids some edge case issues with Shoguns/etc.
- Added e_cordoba_empire; replacing e_cordoba with this if the holder no longer should be a "Caliph".
- The ruler of e_india is no longer the Samrat/Samrajni Chakravartin; this title is instead rewarded to the creator of e_india if Dharmic. Prevents issues with Shoguns using an improper title.
- Fixed the capitals of Chagatai, the Ilkhanate, and the Timurids; vanilla stupidity.

# Laws
- Chinese, Japonic, Koreanic, Viet, and Jurchen rulers should now default to Agnatic if not scripted as something else, unless feminist = yes or the like.
- Chinese Imperial, Confucian Bureaucracy, Eastern Imperial, Japanese Imperial, Japanese Bureaucracy, Japanese Feudal, Japanese Monastic Feudal, and Divine Imperial rulers can no longer get assorted normal elective laws; special elective laws designed for them may or may not be available.
- Chinese Imperial, Confucian Bureaucracy, Eastern Imperial, Japanese Imperial, Japanese Bureaucracy, Japanese Feudal, Japanese Monastic Feudal, and Divine Imperial rulers can no longer get Full Council Authority, seeing as that forces elective.
- Allowed various bureaucratic realms (Chinese Imperial, Confucian Bureaucracy, Eastern Imperial, Japanese Imperial, Japanese Bureaucracy, Divine Imperial) access to Imperial Administration even at king tier.

- Chinese/Eastern/Japanese/Divine Imperial, Confucian/Japanese Bureaucracy, Japanese Feudal, and Japanese Monastic Feudal rulers should no longer default to Agnatic-Cognatic, and will therefore default to Agnatic outside of Japanese/Divine Imperial (defaults to Absolute Cognatic unless barred due to Doctrines). Certain historical realms are still scripted to start with Agnatic-Cognatic, e.g. Silla.
- Various flavours of bureaucratic realms now default to the council having all powers except the last one (forced Elective).
- Restructured the Regency Power laws as a single group, and made some other changes to them.
- The Tenno and the Ryukyuan knockoff are now locked into their respective succession laws as far as secondary titles go as well, which generally will mean they have the same heir in AI hands.
- Updated law restrictions for the "The Three Mountains" Doctrine.
- Added new interest group laws for CI/EI(/ConBu) rulers.
- Added a new succession law for independent king+ for CI/EI/ConBu rulers, used by many relevant realms.

- Vassals and below of rulers that are unable to enact religious title revocation can no longer enact said law.
- Gender laws are hopefully less wrong now.
- Told the AI not to be so eager to go Agnatic-Cognatic in China/Japan/etc.
- Rulers with an Unquestioned Mandate rating can now potentially depower the GC and/or the Eunuchs at times others couldn't.
- It is now possible to depower a non-existent Grand Chancellor without first shifting other laws.
- Independent ConBu rulers should now start with (and default to) Primogeniture, resulting in fewer cases of realms imploding due to an European succession arrangement where it makes little sense.
- Fixed some issues with Chinese laws not working as expected.
- Minahasan pagans are now eligible for Cognatic succession and Feudal Elective (for the time being).
- Minahasans now properly start with Feudal Elective (unique elective law TODO in a future release).
- Cut the Kurultai succession law; our implementation wasn't great, and fixing it would a) be too much work at this time and b) might be better to do once we've thought more about nomads.
- Holy orders should now have appropriate gender laws set.
- Enatic and Enatic-Cognatic now explicitly unlock matrilineal marriages, to account for some possible edge cases.

# Localisation

- Updated some inconsistent, old, and/or confusing localisation.
- Improved Mu, Gut, Chuseok, and Bulguksa pilgrimage localisation slightly.
- Improved Hwarang localisation.
- Improved WotRS localization.

- The Tanist minor title is now localized more appropriate if you are not Celtic but use Tanistry or a law based on it.
- A Buddhist temple barony is now known as a "Temple" rather than a "Vihara", seeing as the latter looks odd in many places.

- Updated the Kowtow traits' localization to no longer reference the offmap.
- A number of explicit references to "Priests", "Bishops", "the Bible", and other religious stuff now properly check localisation tags for the relevant religions or have been rewritten to be more neutral, because vanilla sure had not considered that sort of thing as thoroughly as it should have.
- Excluding the Andamanese, Nivkh, Taiwanese, and Papuan cultures, all Tianxia cultures should now have cultural titles (e.g. "Daimyo").

- All Japanese Bureaucracy, Japanese Feudal, and Japanese Monastic Feudal emperor-tier rulers are now referred to as Shoguns regardless of culture.
- Aztec priest loc should now work, and should now be more correct (vanilla uses "Shaman", which is very silly).
- Fixed "tenants" in Samaritan SRS. Vanilla error.
- The mysterious "Southern Coast of Busaro" is now properly known as the "Southern Coast of Busaso". That's only been in the mod since late 2018...
- The FoA for a Caliph is now "Your Magnificence", not "Your Imperial Majesty", seeing as there isn't necessarily a correlation between emperor tier and being a caliph.
- Added cultural titles for many Tianxia tribals.
- The Spanish no longer buy into Ottoman propaganda.
- Replaced a lying LOADING_TIP and added a couple of Tianxia ones.
- Added back some old Tianxia loc for Roman titles/characters.
- Renamed Skylord to "Lord/Lady of the Sky" to make it slightly less weird if the Tengri faith goes Enatic or Equal.
- Pluralised Nats properly.
- Added _desc entries for all religions; some might be worth iterating on in the future.
- Added _EXPLANATION for all <trait>_opinion and opinion_of_<trait> modifiers.
- Improved some vanilla custom loc; for example, Norse faithful now know better than to refer to "Thor's hammer" as such.
- MNM.3227 can no longer result in the averting of someone else's eyes, and no longer makes assumptions about priestly gender.
- Added and appended _FEATURES to various religions that have access to noteworthy mechanics not listed, such as government eligibility. Reformed pagans only get guaranteed features listed, so e.g. Eastern syncretism is not listed for Reformed Bön due to Dogmatic rendering them ineligible. To be iterated on after 14.0.0.
- God names starting with "the" are now properly decapitalised.
- The slavic_pagan _desc doesn't consider it "heathenry", seeing as that's frequently got negative connotations.

- All non-Eastern religions now get the "SoA might be good for you because of holy orders" DLC suggestion.
- Updated Lords of the Sky founding event desc to work if Tengri is not their HighGod.
- The Lords of the Sky are now the Host of the Heavenly Horses, and thus less odd if the Tengri reform with Enatic.

- Added _desc entries for several minor titles.
- Added government-related loc for title_tanist.
- Added government-related loc for title_regent.
- Added cultural loc for title_regent.
- Added and adjusted _FEATURES entries for several cultures and culture groups to highlight government eligiblity when Buddhist (all other religions are all-or-nothing as far as government eligiblity goes).
- Made it abundantly clear that cats are superior AND that they know it.
- Palnatoke (or his female counterpart) will no longer speak of "Thor and Odin", seeing as the Norse religion might be reformed in a fashion that would make them be considered evil.

- Added temple holding names.
- Improved priest titles.
- Some TF loc now properly references treasure_fleet_original_sender instead of treasure_fleet_sender where the former makes more sense than the latter.
- The Tenno and the knockoff will now properly be referred to as "Your Imperial Majesty", regardless of de facto tier.
- Minor tweaks to cultural building loc, mainly RW-adjacent; we're not still that for the time being, but some things can easily be adjusted for it.
- The Shravanabelagola arrival loc no longer has numbers in the English loc; spelling the words out looks nicer!

- Characters should no longer refer to themselves as the would-be murderer if a Private Conversation goes wrong because the other party tried to murder them.

# Map
- Moved Taiwan out of the China region; aside from Penghu, China didn't control anything in the region during the era, and it had undesirable mechanical implications in various places.

# Mercenaries
- Imperial [s]Speedbump[/s] Guard regiments changed from mercs to event troops. The allow condition broke before the Guard did!
- Overhauled Tianxia's mercs.
- The Bengal Band and the Bengal Company are now Buddhist (as they are mercs, this does not have much of an effect).
- Removed hire_range entry from all non-African mercs; vanilla setup that becomes nonsensical with an expanded map.
- The Jurchen Band and the Jurchen Corsairs are now Jurchen when it comes to both culture and religion.
- Adjusted the capitals of many vanilla mercs relevant to our part of the map (i.e. the Chinese/Jurchen/etc. ones).
- The various d_han_<something> merc companies are now Confucian (as they are mercs, this does not have much of an effect).
- Decided that vanilla's decision to give Berber mercs to the Mazdans was copy-paste nonsense, and fixed it.
- Decided that d_sunni_cuman_company actually is not at all a Sunni merc company since they are the "Khazar Company", and adjusted religion and availability accordingly.
- The Tamil Band is now Buddhist, seeing as they're from Buddhist Lanka.
- Set up new Tianxia mercs, taking inspiration from a variety of places (there aren't really famous merc companies around...).
- Vanilla Jurchen mercs no longer bring horse archers; it wasn't really their thing.

# Minor titles
- Updated access to several titles, e.g. ensuring some Tianxia pagans also have access to default pagan titles.
- Removed irrelevant Shogun and Shikken minor titles.
- Removed old Chinese eunuch minor title; it's not been relevant for a few versions...
- Changed Council Eunuchs to no longer require high Learning. Should make it more likely that eunuchs sent as tribute can be appointed... and that pretty terrible eunuchs can be influential.
- Chinese Imperial and Confucian Bureaucracy no longer require a Designated Regent to strictly have high Learning; they can get away with being good in some other stat as long as learning is decent.
- Chinese Imperial and Confucian Bureaucracy no longer require an advisor to strictly have high Learning; they can get away with being good in some other stat as long as learning is decent.
- Adjusted firing conditions for councillors for rulers with Chinese- or Japanese-style governments, generally making things harder.
- The Tenno now gets the extra advisor for emperors even if he doesn't hold an emperor-tier title. He is, after all, *very* insistent that he *is* an emperor, so he'll have to live with the consequences.
- The Ryukyuan knockoff now gets both advisors even as a duke or king.
- If you grant a councillor position to a Grand Chancellor bloodline member and you can have a Grand Chancellor they will immediately gain the Grand Chancellor minor title if you don't already have one of those.
- Added a minor title for Grand Chancellors, tying some of the bloodline's powers to it. Requires JD + Conclave.
- Members of Confucius' bloodline can no longer grant the Duke Yansheng minor title, seeing as anyone relevant in a position to do that presumably wouldn't exalt someone else.
- Becoming the Grand Chancellor will now make you the Designated Regent, and if your liege has a regency you'll become the regent on the next daily tick.
- Members of the ruling dynasty can now become Grand Chancellors.
- If someone stops being the Grand Chancellor due to taking over from their liege (for whatever reason) they no longer automatically appoint another Grand Chancellor the instant they assume the throne.
- Being landed makes you ineligible to be a Council Eunuch, so the next time your Court Physician gets "creative" when treating a minor illness that particular upside is no longer a thing.
- Becoming the Grand Chancellor now sets ai_flag_never_transfer, so AI lieges will not (normally) arrange for their Grand Chancellors to be dismissed because they suddenly feel an irresistible urge to rearrange their vassal setup.
- The duke_yansheng minor title is now localized as "Honorable Overflowing with Wisdom".
- When someone becomes the Grand Chancellor they are now saved as the persistent_event_target my_grand_chancellor in the liege scope. Might be useful for scripting.
- Added a revoke_trigger for the Commander minor title.
- Viet characters can now appoint a Master of Elephants.
- The Tenno and the Ryukyuan knockoff can no longer serve on the council or serve as commanders. They do not serve... and it prevents "Send them into battle and hope they die!" and "Give them a council position to prevent factioning!" exploits!
- JD minor titles are now more sensibly allocated.
- Court Musicians and Court Poets are now available for all Eastern religions.
- Should a character with a relevant culture hold the ERE/RE they may now appoint a Master of Elephants.

- Added nicknames (not cognomina) for a number of Roman Emperors.
- Added nicknames for a couple of not-Holy, not-Roman, not-Emperors.
- Removed the "the Unknown Master" nickname; he's got a better one now!
- The "Ichi no Hito" nickname can now be earned by Yamato/Japanese/Wako Permanent Regents if they are fully empowered, Proud, and belong to a Regency bloodline, though it's unlikely to be earned.
- Added the "the Shirabyoshi" nickname, applied to relevant event characters.
- nick_the_lioness is now handed out to women where men would get nick_the_lion, and the latter is now male-exclusive.
- nick_the_lion is now considered cool, seeing as nick_the_lioness is.
- Most tiger-related nicknames now have tigress counterparts.
- BitP can now occasionally result in a cool nickname (well, two, but they're gendered versions of the same...). It's not super cool, however.
- Nickname chance now uses numerical operators.

# Offmap titles
- Commented out offmap_china correctly.
- Added replace_path to get rid of vanilla's offmap China's history.
- Commented out a number of references to offmap_china.

# on_actions
- Moved some things to less frequent on_actions to improve performance.
- Improved Aclla setup.
- Commented out some achievement events that obviously do nothing useful.
- Leaving the WotRS now properly clears out enlisted Ronin.

- Decreased the magnitude of quite a few opinion modifiers.

# Plots
- Cleaned up a deprecated plot.
- It is no longer possible to plot to revoke vassal titles when you have a Permanent Regent after the AI showed an exploit involving targeting the Permanent Regent.
- Removed the plots (Tenno and Shogun) to become a Permanent Regent; use the faction instead!
- Grand Chancellor bloodline members can now fabricate claims on Chinese Imperial empires if their liege's MoH is Average or lower.
- Grand Chancellor bloodline members are now more likely to try to fabricate clams on Chinese Imperial empires.
- Made it impossible for people that should care to use plots to fabricate claims on the Tenno or the Ryukyuan knockoff.
- Only feudal (is_feudal = yes) characters can claim a Chinese Imperial title with a plot if their liege's MoH rating drops too low.

# Reformations (with HF)
- Added Tolerant Nature.
- Added Spiritual Leadership.
- Added Divine Ancestry Leadership.
- Removed the Confucian Principles Doctrine.
- Reworked a number of Unique Doctrines.
- Added unique Doctrines for all new pagan religions.

- Fixed a number of vanilla and Tianxia errors where "combo" Doctrines weren't counted properly for some things.
- Set up tooltips to clearly show if a reformation gives access to certain government types.
- Dogmatic religions now laugh at heathens and heretics that think that they'd approve of intermarriage because said heathens and heretics happen to be Cosmopolitan or Tolerant.
- The Religious Tax Doctrine is now incompatible with the Tolerant and Cosmopolitan Natures; treated the latter as a vanilla bug because it's rather nonsensical.
- The "The Three Mountains" Doctrine can no longer be picked alongside the Unyielding Nature.
- The "The Three Mountains" Doctrine now gives access to the once-per-life (actually 100 years) Ryukyuan Subjugation CB, available against any and all independent targets within holy war range. This CB counts as a holy war as far as co-religionists joining goes (i.e. has is_holy_war = yes), and works as other Subjugation CBs w.r.t. the Become King ambition. Losing this war to a co-religionist as a secular Ryukyuan rel head means losing the rel head title, regardless of whether you remain independent, seeing as you are obviously unfit to rule the world.
- The "The Three Mountains" Doctrine now makes rulers with the Doctrine more likely to join the Independence faction.
- The "The Three Mountains" Doctrine now makes rulers with the Doctrine more likely to start and back factions for their own claims.
- The "The Three Mountains" Doctrine now locks the Conclave Vassal Wars law to "Allowed".
- The "The Three Mountains" Doctrine now locks the Viceroyalty law to "No Viceroyalties".
- It is no longer possible to pick the Syncretism Doctrine when refomring the Tengri religion (due to it having been made inherent).
- Classified vanilla's decision to allow the selection of Enatic Clans *after* Polygamy but not Polygamy *after* Enatic Clans as a bug, and decided against the latter, however amusing.
- Cosmopolitan/Tolerant + Syncretism: Multiple "Sympathy for X" traits from the decision.
- A Focus on Family + Meritocracy: +1 to primary stat.
- A Focus on Family + Self-Improvement: Chance of relative to attempt to complete same ambition when you do.
- Divine Ancestry + A Focus on Family: MA boost on birth of child/grandchild, with some Agnatic/Enatic Clans and Dogmatic extras.
- Divine Ancestry + Bloodthirsty Gods: Rel head gets small MA boost for sacrificing other religions' divine descendants (including Amaterasu Descendants).

# Religions
- Removed long disabled Zurvanite and Mandean religions.
- Added +1 piety/month while at peace to the Taoist religion.
- Overhauled assorted intermarriage setups, making it bidirectionally consistent prior to possible Cosmopolitan/Tolerant reformations.
- Overhauled the Shinto god name list and the Shinto evil god name list.
- Unreformed Ainu pagans no longer lose prestige due to being at peace. Reformed may or may not, depending on reformation picks.
- Unreformed Shenist, Muist, and Ryukyuan pagans no longer get a warscore bonus in independence wars, similar to unreformed Hellenic.
- Unreformed Shenist, Thanist, Muist, and Ryukyuan pagans no longer get offensive/defensive pagan bonuses, similar to Hellenic.
- Unreformed Shenist, Thanist, Muist, and Ryukyuan pagans now have an aggression of 1, same as e.g. Taoist.

- Ainu priests can now inherit.

- Shenists should now be able to have female Wu
- Confucian priests should now be able to marry
- Some new god names have been added for Confucian, Taoist and Shenist

- Added the Benzhuist religion.
- Added the Bimoist religion.
- Added the Keb Dab Kev Qhuas religion.
- Added the Moist (NOT MoHist) religion.
- Added tai_pagan/_reformed (Satsana Phi), burmese_pagan/_reformed (Nat), andamanese_pagan/_reformed, batak_pagan/_reformed (Pemena), minangkabau_pagan/_reformed, sundanese_pagan/_reformed (Sunda Wiwitan), and Kejawèn religions.
- Jain are now as aggressive as Peaceful pagans in AI hands; vanilla inconsistency fix.
- Disabled castes for Buddhists; they certainly didn't use those in large parts of our map.
- Kejawèn now has castes, caste opinions, and heir designation.
- Decided Aztec lack of raiding was a bug; Nahua has it, but any converts should also have it...

- All Eastern religions now only convert provinces with high ai_zeal regardless of religion group.
- The Andamanese religion is monogamous by default (though all Andamanese characters are Tribal in all starts, so...).

- The Saio/Saiin are now Theocratic to make sure they don't get married.
- All Tianxia pagans now have the pagan defaults regarding joining crusades and calling crusades (HF reformations can of course change this).

- Random Council Eunuchs can now be Lustful and Seducers, even if they of course might find it a bit harder to act on it...
- Many iterative changes to the MoH calculations.
- Removed preset attribute values for randomly generated Council Eunuchs. After all, we don't really need them to be incredibly competent...

- Should the Sakanoue clan lose their bloodline somehow they'll still remember that any Chinese Imperial empire of theirs probably should be named "Han"
- Should Go Yeongchang or his hypothetical relatives create a pretender empire prior to him historically doing so they'll approve of the name "Yuan". It went so well historically...

- Rulers with at least one Silk Road province should now get more random random eunuchs for council spots.

- Sanity checks for impregnation effects.
- Tianxia-ified SRS scripted effects.
- Added and fixed some TF effects.
- If the Tenno somehow converts (several loopholes have been closed in the past...) he will now abdicate to a relative, as opposed to destroying the Chrysanthemum Throne.
- Theocracies and holy orders now respect gender restrictions when abdicating on conversion.
- give_random_character_modifier_effect is now saner.
- Peasant Leaders founding pretender empires should now be a bit more prone to founding dynasties named after ones historically founded by peasants.
- Updated transfer_crown_on_abdication_effect.

# scripted_triggers

- Fixed some inconsistencies with vanilla.
- Qarmatians should now be properly implemented; vanilla forgot about them in several places.
- AI-controlled characters with a bureaucratic (Chinese Imperial/Eastern Imperial/Confucian Bureaucracy/Japanese Imperial/Japanese Bureaucracy/Divine Imperial) government will now not take to the field personally unless they a) are commanders, b) are marshals, c) have a martial education, or d) are members of either the WotRS or the Hwarang.

- Improved title creation conditions.
- Updated nickname coolness.
- Added is_actually_incapable_trigger; incapable_according_to_regent passes is_incapable and capable_only checks, which might be undesirable at times.
- Added has_caste_traits_trigger; checks if a religion/culture has them, not if a character has any caste traits.

- Tributaries of pretender emperors no longer get to interact with the Treasure Fleet.
- Moved shared councillor firing conditions to a scripted_trigger.

- Minahasans no longer care about councillor gender.
- Updated some gender-related and/or job-related scripted_triggers for Tianxia changes.

- Patrilineal Shinto descendants of Emperor Jimmu now gain extra society membership score and monthly society currency in the Fellowship of the Kami.
- Amaterasu Descendants now gain slightly less society membership score and monthly society currency in the Fellowship of the Kami, considering many people with this trait also are patrilineal descendants of Emperor Jimmu.
- Removed Hermetic access for Sanamahists and Shenists. It never made much sense. Taoists keep it, for now, because vanilla.
- Lowered the Buddhist MO's Level 4 revolt risk reduction to 1 % (was 8 %). It was too powerful, particularly for low MoH rulers...
- Gave Level 4 Buddhist MO members +1 Learning. Subject to balance, but they needed something due to the above nerf.
- Removed Fellowship of the Kami county conversion power.
- Removed Fellowship of the Kami revolt risk modifier.
- Added new Level 4 Fellowship of the Kami power(s).

- Hwarang age checks now use numerical operators.

# Succession voting

- Overhauled Tianxia's voting patterns, optimizing them and cleaning them up.

- Confucian now has two branches, Traditionalist and Neo-Confucian.
- Taoists now have branch traits instead of branch modifiers.
- Rulers under a Permanent Regency should now be a bit more ambitious.
- The Taoist schools now have the customary -5 opinion of each other.
- Added a Former Son/Daughter of Heaven trait, awarded on losing a Chinese Imperial title to an usurper and carrying the same penalties as having Lost the Mandate of Heaven. Should make it much harder for deposed rulers to make a comeback... and should make it undesirable to keep them around.
- Former and currrent Sons/Daughters of Heaven dislike each other.
- The In Mourning trait now adds +5 Confucian opinion, and lowers AI ambition.
- Added new incapable_according_to_regent trait, seeing as your regent declaring you incapable shouldn't make you *actually* incapable.
- Muslims can now get the Scholar trait; fixes assorted vanilla stupidity related to not checking if characters are Muslim before possibly handing out the trait.
- The Faqih trait now gives less learning, considering it now stacks with Scholar.
- Wako characters can now gain Pirate trait upgrades, as can some specific Pirate trait holders.
- Yupaychaspa characters now approve of Left-handed.

- Members of the Hwarang will no longer get confused about which traits they are reflecting upon.
- Fixed some issues with the Grand Chancellor bloodline.
- Lowered the prestige loss for various kinds of Chinese tributaries significantly (now -0.25/-0.5/-0.75/-1 for count/duke (or king-tier nomad)/king (or emperor-tier nomad/emperor, multiplied by tributary tier, with puppets counting as client states), seeing as small realms being completely crippled by tributary relationships wasn't ideal.

- Members of the Hwarang that have reflected on a trait should now consider themselves done with that business for real if they succeed or decide to give up.
- Hopefully made it possible for people stuck reflecting on a trait due to not having the modifier cleared out to start over (at the cost of possibly letting someone that's not truly stuck start reflecting on a second trait in old saves).

- Fixed some localization regarding society currency gain for members of the Hwarang and the WotRS.
- Minor localization improvements and fixes.

- The Tenno should no longer consider factioning for someone else under any circumstances.

- The Permanent Regent should now be reluctant to put someone that's landed on the Chrysanthemum Throne, particularly someone that's got an impressive title.

- Added factions for installing Permanent Regents for the Tenno and Shinto/Japonic Buddhist emperors that are feudal and aren't Chinese Imperial.
