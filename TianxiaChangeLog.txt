--------------------------------------

General:
- Made Tianxia fully compatibile with 3.3.
- Added many new CoAs in China, Dali, Vietnam, Korea, Balhae, and Japan, courtesy of Brightgalrs.
- Added a Lunar New Year celebration decision with related events for Taoists, Shenists, Reformed Shenists, Chinese culture group Buddhists, and anyone ruling a pretender empire.

Balance:

- Made it cheaper and easier to create e_jurchen_china (Jin).
- Islam will now spread more slowly into tribal land in Indonesia.
- Pretender empires now only get special liberation-style revolts if their Mandate of Heaven is Lost. China itself still has to deal with them for both Lost and Poor Mandate ratings.
- Becoming a pretender empire now grants a weak inheritable claim on China.
- Recreating China as a pretender now grants other pretenders a weak inheritable claim on China.
- Becoming a pretender empire or recreating China as a pretender now grants you Imperial Administration and Duchy Viceroyalties, assuming you have the relevant DLCs.
- The Works of Shan Yu (are you familiar with them?) will now be less likely to spawn far away from China.

History:
- Updated a bunch of character IDs. This will break saves, but you shouldn't use existing saves with the Closed Alpha version anyway.
- Added proper Buddhist branch traits to a bunch of historical rulers.
- Set the historical Liao emperors to use their historical temple names if Chinese Imperial (note that the temple name is granted on death in Tianxia, so you won't see it right away).

- Added traits to a bunch of historical emperors of China and several of their family members.
- Added many, many Tang and Song imperial family members.

- The Sui and Zhou (Wu Zeitan's short-lived dynasty) families now have Chinese Imperial bloodlines.
- Added Li Yu to the title history of e_china, despite his brief reign.
- Daizong of Tang (in the CM start) will now start Buddhist, as he probably became a devout Buddhist before 769.

- Yinzong now has some bad traits. 1066 should be a bit more interesting as a result.

Bugfixes:

- Blocked Chinese/Japanese Imperial rulers and the lieges of Japanese Imperial rulers (i.e. the Shogun) from forming Russia, restoring the ERE (after the Fourth Crusade), restoring the RE, forming/restoring the Bulgarian Empire and forming the Slavic Union. None of these rulers should care about those things, and it could break things.
- Buddhist Chinese Imperial rulers can no longer order the creation of a holy order to fight the enemies of Buddhism, as they're already claiming that religion doesn't really matter.

- RIP.21009 (Martial Eternal Life event) now correctly has a narrative_frame.
- WotRS poetry contest event option selections should now generate a proper number of options.
- WotRS poetry contest event option selections should no longer loop 100k times and freeze the game.

- Buddhists with relevant cultures can now be selected to join relevant DW societies at the start.

- The Claimant faction now accounts for the Ryukyuan reformation Doctrines granting Equality.
