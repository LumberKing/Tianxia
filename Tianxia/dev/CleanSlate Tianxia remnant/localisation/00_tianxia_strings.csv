EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_21;The sword Thuan Thien has served you well, but of late you have started to get the feeling that perhaps it is time for Heaven's Will to be passed on. The feeling is particularly strong whenever you walk past a lake in [thuan_thien_lake.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_21;Throw the sword into the lake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_21;I will keep the sword!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_60;A young Hindu priest approached you today, asking you to come with him to a hidden shrine in [artifact_province.GetName]. His only request is that you pay for the extensive offerings he wishes to leave at the shrine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_60;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_60;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_61;It would seem that the young Hindu priest you met the other day has vanished without a trace. When questioning the priests at a nearby temple, they claim that they have never met a man matching the description of the missing priest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_61;Find that man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_62;With the preparations finalized, you and the young Hindu priest set out towards the hidden shrine in [artifact_province.GetName], bringing with you plentiful offerings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_62;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_63;You eventually arrive at the shrine the young priest has been telling you about during the journey. However, despite the man claiming that it would be a wondrous sight to behold, it is little more than an overgrown ruin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_63;Well, this was a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_63;You will suffer for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_64;The Hidden Shrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_64;After a long journey, you and the young priest arrive at the shrine you set out to reach in [artifact_province.GetName], and it truly is a sight to behold. Impressive carvings of various Hindu mythological figures decorate the walls, and statues of Kali, Shiva, Vishnu, and other gods are located both inside and outside the shrine itself.\n\nFor some unknown reason, the young priest who came there with you seems somewhat disappointed during the visit, and he seems to grow even more so over time as he study the carvings and statues. You leave him at it and just take in the scenery. This journey certainly was worthwhile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_64;A most impressive shrine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_64;Impressive, but not holy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_64;I should convert to Hindu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ARTIFACTS_64;I should convert, secretly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_65;The Hidden Shrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_65;After a long journey, you and the young priest arrive at the shrine you set out to reach in [artifact_province.GetName], and it truly is a sight to behold. Impressive carvings of various Hindu mythological figures decorate the walls, and statues of Kali, Shiva, Vishnu, and other gods are located both inside and outside the shrine itself.\n\nAs you enjoy the scenery, the young priest with you studies the walls carefully and eventually lets out a triumphant cry. Looking over towards him, you see him push on one of the stones in one of the walls, revealing a doorway.\n\n"I'll be right back," he tells you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_65;I'll come with you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_65;I think I'll leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_66;You and the young priest descend down a stairway illuminated only by the flickering light of the torch you are bringing with you. As you reach the bottom just behind the young man, you see him draw a knife from a sheath on his belt.\n\n"You should leave now, my [Root.GetLordLady]," he says. "If not, you will die!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_66;You dare threaten me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_66;Fine! I will leave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_67;You draw your own weapon and engage the young priest in the dimly lit hallway. It is a difficult fight due to the light and the confined space, but eventually you get the upper hand and strike the young man down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_67;I despise traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_68;You draw your own weapon and engage the young priest in the dimly lit hallway. He manages to inflict a grievous wound on you during the fight, but eventually you get the upper and and strike him down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_68;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_69;You draw your own weapon and engage the young priest in the dimly lit hallway. At first, the fight seems to be going your way, but the young man then makes an unexpected attack and inflict a lethal injury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_69;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_71;Stepping past the body of the traitorous priest, you move further down the passageway and eventually reach an altar. While somewhat impressive, there does not appear to be anything of value in the room, so the priest's betrayal truly was strange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_71;This was a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_72;Stepping past the body of the traitorous priest, you move further down the passageway and eventually reach an altar. A statue of Shiva stands above the altar, holding a bow as if he is offering it to you. You suspect that you have found the legendary Vijaya.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_72;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_155;Some peasants in your realm came across an old tome containing what looks like some kind of writing, though not written in a way you or your advisors can read. They have seen fit to gift it to you since you might find it interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_155;Attempt to decipher it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_155;It probably is worthless;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_156;The old tome with the strange writing that you ordered translated has turned out to be impossible to decipher despite the efforts of some of the brightest men and women in your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_156;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_157;The old tome with the strange writing that you ordered translated contained some insights from an era long gone. While not truly groundbreaking discoveries, you believe that these insights might prove to have some value.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_157;I suppose that's good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_158;The old tome with the strange writing that you ordered translated has turned out to be more impressive than anticipated. Dubbed the Epic of Darkness, it is a collection of ancient myths and legends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_158;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
