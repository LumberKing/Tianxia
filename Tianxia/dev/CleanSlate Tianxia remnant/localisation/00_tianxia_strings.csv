EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_12;You have started to hear rumours about a strangely glowing banyan tree in [artifact_province.GetName]. You do not know where the rumours started, but perhaps it is worth trying to find this tree?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_12;I must find this tree!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_12;I have better things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_13;Shortly before you reach [artifact_province.GetName], a forest fire breaks out near where the glowing banyan tree supposedly was located, and you cannot discern which tree it was after arriving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_13;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_14;You arrive at the site of the rumoured glowing banyan tree and discover nothing but a tree stump. When questioning the peasants in the area, you discover that they decided to cut down the tree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_14;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_14;You will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_15;The Glowing Tree;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_15;You arrive in [artifact_province.GetName] and start asking around for the rumoured glowing banyan tree. It does not take you long to discover someone who knows where the tree can be found, and you are quickly given instructions as to how to reach it.\n\nUpon arriving at the site, you are awestruck by the sight of the tree. For some reason you cannot describe, the branches of the tree seem to be glowing faintly. It truly is a wonderous sight.\n\nPerhaps cutting the tree down would be a good idea?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_15;Cut it down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_15;Leave it be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_18;After cutting down the strangely glowing tree, you discover that one of the branches apparently is hollow. Inside the branch, you find a jewel-encrusted sword hilt which seems to be emitting a slight glow, much like the tree once did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_18;This might be worth keeping...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_17;You cut down the banyan tree and start chopping up the wood, looking for the source of the strange glow, but it would seem that you cut down the wondrous tree for nothing. Doubtlessly, the people in the area will not appreciate losing the tree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_17;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_20;You bring the strangely glowing hilt and blade you own together and discover that it is a perfect fit. As you do so, the words Thuan Thien - Heaven's Will - come to you, and you at once know what to call your new sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_20;Bow before Heaven's Will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_21;The sword Thuan Thien has served you well, but of late you have started to get the feeling that perhaps it is time for Heaven's Will to be passed on. The feeling is particularly strong whenever you walk past a lake in [thuan_thien_lake.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_21;Throw the sword into the lake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_21;I will keep the sword!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_22;Word has reached your court that there is a fisherman in [artifact_province.GetName] that has discovered a wondrous glowing blade on one of his fishing trips. Perhaps you should try to find him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_22;Yes, I must see this blade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_22;I have no time for rumours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_23;You manage to track down the fisherman you were looking for in [artifact_province.GetName], but the blade he shows you is utterly remarkable and clearly not glowing. Apparently he was exaggerating the importance of his discovery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_23;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_23;You will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_24;You find the fisherman you were looking for in [artifact_province.GetName] too late, for he tells you that he sold the blade he had found to a passing wanderer a few days ago and that he has no idea where the man went.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_24;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_24;Give me the money, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_24;You will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_26;The Glowing Blade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_26;It takes you some time to track down the fisherman you are looking for in [artifact_province.GetName], but eventually you find the man. He invites you into his home and shows you the blade he discovered, and you can see the glow emitted by the blade for yourself.\n\n"I would like to keep the blade, my [Root.GetLordLady]," the man tells you. "However, if you are prepared to pay my price, I will reluctantly part with it." He names a price that is considerably higher than you would have hoped for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_26;I'll pay your price!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_26;Guards! Get me that blade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_26;Keep the blade!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_28;The Glowing Blade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_28;You spend some time searching for the fisherman who supposedly discovered the blade in [artifact_province.GetName] and are about to give up hope when you finally discover someone who knows where to find him. You make your way to his home and are welcomed inside by the old man.\n\n"I did discover a glowing blade, my [Root.GetLordLady]," he tells you, quickly fetching it so that you might see it for yourself. "I have long questioned what I should do with the blade, for I did not think it was truly meant for me, and now I know that it is to be yours. Take it, please!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_28;Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_60;A young Hindu priest approached you today, asking you to come with him to a hidden shrine in [artifact_province.GetName]. His only request is that you pay for the extensive offerings he wishes to leave at the shrine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_60;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_60;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_61;It would seem that the young Hindu priest you met the other day has vanished without a trace. When questioning the priests at a nearby temple, they claim that they have never met a man matching the description of the missing priest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_61;Find that man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_62;With the preparations finalized, you and the young Hindu priest set out towards the hidden shrine in [artifact_province.GetName], bringing with you plentiful offerings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_62;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_63;You eventually arrive at the shrine the young priest has been telling you about during the journey. However, despite the man claiming that it would be a wondrous sight to behold, it is little more than an overgrown ruin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_63;Well, this was a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_63;You will suffer for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_64;The Hidden Shrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_64;After a long journey, you and the young priest arrive at the shrine you set out to reach in [artifact_province.GetName], and it truly is a sight to behold. Impressive carvings of various Hindu mythological figures decorate the walls, and statues of Kali, Shiva, Vishnu, and other gods are located both inside and outside the shrine itself.\n\nFor some unknown reason, the young priest who came there with you seems somewhat disappointed during the visit, and he seems to grow even more so over time as he study the carvings and statues. You leave him at it and just take in the scenery. This journey certainly was worthwhile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_64;A most impressive shrine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_64;Impressive, but not holy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_64;I should convert to Hindu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ARTIFACTS_64;I should convert, secretly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_65;The Hidden Shrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_65;After a long journey, you and the young priest arrive at the shrine you set out to reach in [artifact_province.GetName], and it truly is a sight to behold. Impressive carvings of various Hindu mythological figures decorate the walls, and statues of Kali, Shiva, Vishnu, and other gods are located both inside and outside the shrine itself.\n\nAs you enjoy the scenery, the young priest with you studies the walls carefully and eventually lets out a triumphant cry. Looking over towards him, you see him push on one of the stones in one of the walls, revealing a doorway.\n\n"I'll be right back," he tells you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_65;I'll come with you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_65;I think I'll leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_66;You and the young priest descend down a stairway illuminated only by the flickering light of the torch you are bringing with you. As you reach the bottom just behind the young man, you see him draw a knife from a sheath on his belt.\n\n"You should leave now, my [Root.GetLordLady]," he says. "If not, you will die!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_66;You dare threaten me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_66;Fine! I will leave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_67;You draw your own weapon and engage the young priest in the dimly lit hallway. It is a difficult fight due to the light and the confined space, but eventually you get the upper hand and strike the young man down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_67;I despise traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_68;You draw your own weapon and engage the young priest in the dimly lit hallway. He manages to inflict a grievous wound on you during the fight, but eventually you get the upper and and strike him down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_68;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_69;You draw your own weapon and engage the young priest in the dimly lit hallway. At first, the fight seems to be going your way, but the young man then makes an unexpected attack and inflict a lethal injury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_69;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_71;Stepping past the body of the traitorous priest, you move further down the passageway and eventually reach an altar. While somewhat impressive, there does not appear to be anything of value in the room, so the priest's betrayal truly was strange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_71;This was a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_72;Stepping past the body of the traitorous priest, you move further down the passageway and eventually reach an altar. A statue of Shiva stands above the altar, holding a bow as if he is offering it to you. You suspect that you have found the legendary Vijaya.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_72;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_155;Some peasants in your realm came across an old tome containing what looks like some kind of writing, though not written in a way you or your advisors can read. They have seen fit to gift it to you since you might find it interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_155;Attempt to decipher it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_155;It probably is worthless;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_156;The old tome with the strange writing that you ordered translated has turned out to be impossible to decipher despite the efforts of some of the brightest men and women in your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_156;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_157;The old tome with the strange writing that you ordered translated contained some insights from an era long gone. While not truly groundbreaking discoveries, you believe that these insights might prove to have some value.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_157;I suppose that's good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_158;The old tome with the strange writing that you ordered translated has turned out to be more impressive than anticipated. Dubbed the Epic of Darkness, it is a collection of ancient myths and legends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_158;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_200;You remove the stopper from the Draught of Healing and pour the liquid inside into your mouth. It has a fruity taste and makes your tongue tingle, and when you swallow it you feel warmth coursing through your whole body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_200;I feel renewed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_201;You remove the stopper from the Vial of Immortality and pour the liquid inside into your mouth. It has a sweet taste and sends a chill through your teeth for a moment, and when you swallow it your body glows for a moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_201;My reign shall be eternal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_202;You gaze out across [Root.Location.GetName], holding the Living Flame in one hand in front of you. It senses what you might ask of it.\n\n"UNLEASH ME, AND I SHALL BURN THIS LAND TO ASHES!" it says. "ALL SHALL BURN! ALL SHALL BE CONSUMED BY THE FLAME! ALL SHALL FEAR YOU!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_202;Burn them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_202;I think that is a bit excessive...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_203;[From.Location.GetName] burns, set ablaze by the power wielded by [From.GetBestName]. Many fail to escape the flames as they consume the province. It is doubtful that the province will recover anytime soon, and it equally doubtful that [From.GetBestName] can be trusted with the power [From.GetSheHe] has unleashed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_203;This mad[From.GetManWoman] must be stopped!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_205;The Living Flame in your possession has been burning dimly for a while, but today it suddenly started to burn with its full intensity.\n\n"I AM RENEWED, HUMAN!" it says. "MY FLAMES SHALL BURN YOUR ENEMIES TO ASHES! NONE CAN WITHSTAND THE FIRES OF DOOM!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_205;Let my enemies beware!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_206;It has come to your attention that [From.GetBestName] now claims to be the rightful master of the Dragon Throne. Apparently [From.GetSheHe] has managed to discover an ancient document once in the possession of the fearsone dragon Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, that proves this claim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_206;An obvious forgery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCA_ARTIFACTS_207;You are discussing a routine matter regarding the training of your guards when Wandy the Talking Wand comes flying from wherever it previously was located, being chased by an irate servant.\n\n"It seems you are trying to handle a matter concerning warfare," it says as it comes to a halt near you. "Would you like some help with that?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ARTIFACTS_207;"Hello!" You look around and spot Wandy the Talking Wand, which apparently has seen fit to approach you as you are thinking about matters of state. "It looks like you are contemplating something related to rulership. Can I help you with that?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ARTIFACTS_207;As you are trying to get some sleep after an exhausting day you suddenly hear a familiar voice.\n\n"It seems like you might be trying to fall asleep. Would you like some help with that?" It does not take you long to locate the speaker, which is none other than Wandy, the Talking Wand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ARTIFACTS_207;You are about to start your dinner when Wandy the Talking Wand appears, almost as if from thin air, startling several other people that are present.\n\n"I believe you might be about to consume nourishment," it says. "Is it possible for me to be of assistance?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_ARTIFACTS_207;During the course of your day you find yourself needing to compose a quick letter, a task you have never found particularly difficult. Suddenly, Wandy the Talking Wand appears next to you.\n\n"It looks like you're writing a letter," it says. "Would you like help with that?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCF_ARTIFACTS_207;In the middle of a conversation with one of your courtiers Wandy the Talking Wand appears right next to you.\n\n"My [Root.GetLordLady], it seems as if you are conversing with this person," it says. "If it pleases you, I can be of assistance with this matter.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCG_ARTIFACTS_207;Wandy the Talking Wand appears next to you. Unlike most of the times it has happened in the past, the wand does not speak. Instead, it is periodically tapping your shoulder, seemingly interested in getting your attention, but nothing happens when you pay attention to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_207;Please go away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_207;You are always so helpful, my friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ARTIFACTS_208;Without warning, the voice of the Sword of Two Minds comes to you.\n\n"Kill them!" it says. "Kill them all!"\n\n"Forgive!" it suddenly tells you. "You should forgive!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ARTIFACTS_208;"Show restraint!" you suddenly hear the voice of the Sword of Two Minds saying in your mind. "Resist temptation!"\n\nUnsurprisingly, it speaks once more a short while later.\n\n"Indulge!" the voice says. "Let loose!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ARTIFACTS_208;As you are waking up one morning you hear the Sword of Two Minds speaking to you inside your head.\n\n"Sleep in!" it says. "Rest a little longer!"\n\n"Rise and shine!" it adds a moment later. "Time to work!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ARTIFACTS_208;One of your courtiers trips and falls nearby with no warning as the two of you are having a conversation.\n\n"Help them!" the voice of the Sword of Two Minds whispers to you.\n\n"Laugh at them!" it continues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_ARTIFACTS_208;You are sharpening the Sword of Two Minds when it suddenly sees fit to speak to you.\n\n"You should always strive to do good!" it tells you.\n\n"Evil is the only way forward!" it says a moment later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_208;Was that supposed to be helpful?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_208;Of course! Of course! I see it now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ARTIFACTS_209;"Beyond this world, there is the Shroud," the voice of Sanity's Demise suddenly whispers in your mind. "Breach it. Breach the Shroud! There, you will find the Five. Make a compact, if you wish, and reap the rewards. Sooner or later, the End of the Cycle must be brought forth!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ARTIFACTS_209;"I had a... sister, once, you know," the dagger you know as Sanity's Demise whispers one day. "She found her way into the hands of a priest fighting a legion, who sadly abused her power and discarded her afterwards. You must never make the same mistake!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ARTIFACTS_209;"Do you know what they are saying behind your back?" Sanity's Demise whispers to you with no warning. "Can you trust your friends? Can you know your enemies? I can show you the truth, as long as you know to trust me and me alone!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ARTIFACTS_209;"I will always be here to help you," you hear the voice of Sanity's Demise say in your mind. "I am, after all, your one true friend. Of course, sometimes I fear that your fragile little mind will be unable to handle the truths I show you... but would insanity really be so bad?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_ARTIFACTS_209;"Humans such as you could be so much more," the dagger you know as Sanity's Demise says in a whisper. "Sadly, your minds are shackled by the fetters you call 'sanity'. Free your mind! Let me expand it! I will show you things you have never dreamt of!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCF_ARTIFACTS_209;"It is curious, don't you think, that the color yellow is associated with the Dragon Throne," the whispering voice of Sanity's Demise unexpectedly says in your mind. "It has of course always been the color of rulership, but there was a time when it was associated with... a King!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCG_ARTIFACTS_209;"In the far north, there is a place of power just outside your reach," Sanity's Demise whispers into your mind one day when you are perusing some maps. "Go there. Bore a hole. The Wheel can be broken, and the Great Serpent can be slain!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCH_ARTIFACTS_209;"Three they are, and three shall they always be," Sanity's Demise whispers. "They hunger, always, for more souls to feed on. Those that stray near their domain may bring them forth. First shall come the Unbidden! The Aberrant shall follow after! And then, the Vehement will arrive!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCI_ARTIFACTS_209;"Names have power, and I know many names," the dagger called Sanity's Demise whispers to you. "I could tell you some of them, and you could speak them. Once or twice would of course not suffice, but three times should be enough for... a revelation!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCJ_ARTIFACTS_209;"Have you ever heard the tragedy of Pius the August?" you hear Sanity's Demise asking in your mind. "It is not a tale a historian would tell you." The dagger laughs in your mind. "He seeks to bring his master into this world, but he is doomed to fail. Alexandra the Saviour will see to it!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCK_ARTIFACTS_209;"Such fascinating secrets those around you have," Sanity's Demise tells you. "The Unfaithful. The Apostate. The Kinslayer. The Traitor. Oh, I am sure you might know who some of them are, but how certain are you? I could tell you a few things, I think...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCL_ARTIFACTS_209;"Just as planned!" Sanity's Demise suddenly proclaims in your mind. "It is all as it should be. The pieces on the chessboard are moving as the players desire while thinking that they have a will of their own. They will all learn the truth, one day, when it no longer matters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCM_ARTIFACTS_209;"Build a temple," the dagger known as Sanity's demise suddenly says, speaking directly into your mind. "Build a temple, and put a bell in it, adorned with great horns. Ring it thirteen times, and the truth as to what lies beneath your cities shall be revealed!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCN_ARTIFACTS_209;"Good and Evil," you hear the voice of Sanity's Demise suddenly whisper in your mind. "Order and Chaos. Blue and Orange." The voice laughs for quite a while before continuing. "Your human notions when it comes to morality are so... quaint.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCO_ARTIFACTS_209;"If you knew more than the merest fraction of what I know, you would go mad," Sanity's Demise proclaims in your mind in the middle of the night, causing you to come awake. "Of course, I'm sure you can stand to know a little more than you currently do, don't you think?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCP_ARTIFACTS_209;"Listen to the voices from beyond the stars," the wicked dagger known as Sanity's Demise whispers to you. "They know the truth. They know all the truths." The dagger lets out a wicked laugh. "You will see, one day soon, when everything is revealed!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCQ_ARTIFACTS_209;"Have you heard of the Outer Gates?" Sanity's Demise suddenly asks in your mind, continuing before you have the chance to attempt to respond to the question. "There are those that would seek to prevent you from questing beyond them, but they lack the vision to see the truth!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCR_ARTIFACTS_209;"Shall I tell you what the future holds?" the voice of Sanity's Demise whispers to you. "It will be grim and dark, you see. The stars shall know no peace, and the laughter of gods shall echo among them. An eternity of slaughter awaits you, as there shall be only war!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCS_ARTIFACTS_209;"That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons even death may die," Sanity's Demise tells you, speaking into your mind. "There are things in this world you cannot possibly know, not if you wish to keep your mind whole. Of course, that would hold you back...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCT_ARTIFACTS_209;"Six are the stones, but only two are nearby," Sanity's Demise tells you one day after you have visited a small shrine. "Space is in the church. Time is in the Sanctum. Find them, and use them to find the Soul, the Mind, Reality, and Power. Once that is done, snap your fingers and all shall be as you desire!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCU_ARTIFACTS_209;"The Black Pharaoh's reign ended long ago, but he seeks his throne once more," Sanity's Demise's voice whispers. "Should he regain it, all of your petty little squabbles will be as nothing. You might try to oppose him, of course, but to do so you would need my help!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCV_ARTIFACTS_209;"There are powers that would see fit to ask for the blood of a virgin, or a child, or a holy person," Sanity's Demise whispers into your mind. "In truth, any human's blood would suffice. I can show you, if you will only let me! I'm sure you won't regret it...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCW_ARTIFACTS_209;"What was will be," you hear Sanity's Demise whispering. "What will be was. So it has been, always, and so it must always be. The Worm loves you. It always has. It always will. Of course, I love you more than it has, does, or will, and thus you should not be tempted by its power!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCX_ARTIFACTS_209;"With the defeat of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, you must think that this world is capable of defeating any dragon," Sanity's Demise tells you, one day. "I wonder what you will think when you discover the one from the Void. One of you might stand a chance, but would you truly side with Him...?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCY_ARTIFACTS_209;"Beneath the surface of this world you can find many truths," Sanity's Demise tells you. "There are cities there, you know, that belong to those that once ruled this world. Their empires have crubled, but they remain. You should dig for answers!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCZ_ARTIFACTS_209;"Don't think that the fourth wall will protect you, little human!" Sanity's Demise suddenly whispers. "I can see you! I have always been able to see you! But don't be afraid! I am here to help! Let me show you the truth about your world!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_209;Could that be true...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_209;IT SPEAKS THE TRUTH!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ARTIFACTS_210;You are inspecting a recently constructed building in [Root.Location.GetName] when you hear the Living Flame speak to you, even though you have not seen fit to bring it with you.\n\n"IT IS SO FLAMMABLE," it tells you. "BURN IT! BURN IT TO THE GROUND!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ARTIFACTS_210;You are having trouble sleeping one night and decide to go for a walk in [Root.Location.GetName]. A short while after you set off the voice of the Living Flame speaks in your mind.\n\n"THIS NIGHT IS DARK, BUT IT COULD BE SO MUCH BRIGHTER!" it says. "START A BONFIRE!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ARTIFACTS_210;The Living Flame suddenly speaks in your mind one day when you are taking a break from the affairs of the day.\n\n"THIS WORLD, AND EVERYTHING YOU SEE, CAN BURN!" it tells you. "YOU KNOW I SPEAK THE TRUTH, HUMAN, AND YOU KNOW OF SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD BURN!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ARTIFACTS_210;"THIS DAY IS BRIGHT, BUT IT COULD BE EVEN BRIGHTER!" the voice of the Living Flame suddenly says in your mind, catching you by surprise. "GO OUTSIDE! FIND SOMETHING TO BURN! SHOW THE WORLD A SMALL TASTE OF MY POWER!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_ARTIFACTS_210;There are some buildings in [Root.Location.GetName] that are beautiful to look at, but others are not particularly nice to behold. As you are passing by one of the latter, the voice of the Living Fire speaks to you.\n\n"IT IS A BLIGHT, AND IT MUST BE PURIFIED WITH FIRE!" it tells you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCF_ARTIFACTS_210;"FIRE!" the voice of the Living Flame says in your mind. "A GREAT FIRE IS WHAT THIS PLACE NEEDS!" You consider the words for a moment, wondering if the Living Fire is telling the truth. "YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD SET SOMETHING ABLAZE, HUMAN!" the voice continues. "EVERYTHING IS BETTER WITH MORE FIRE!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCG_ARTIFACTS_210;"FIRE CLEANSES!" you hear the Living Flame say in your mind one day when you are taking a short walk. "FIRE ILLUMINATES!" You continue walking, certain that it will speak to you again. "THIS PLACE NEEDS TO BURN! YOU KNOW I SPEAK THE TRUTH!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Give me that prisoner!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ARTIFACTS_211;"I need BLOOD!" the Hungering Blade proclaims one day when you are inspecting it. "I must FEED!"\n\nYou start to consider how you could feed the sword you are holding and eventually find yourself thinking about your prisoners, specifically [hungering_blade_target.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ARTIFACTS_211;One day when you are practicing your skills by swinging the Hungering Blade at some practice targets you feel the sword come awake in your hands.\n\n"Give me a SOUL!" it says. "Give me [hungering_blade_target.GetBestName]'s SOUL!" It starts twisting about in your hand. "You need to FEED me!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_211;Even [hungering_blade_target.GetSheHe] doesn't deserve that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_211;I think it is time for you to feast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_212;You are surprised to see [From.GetBestName] approach you, carrying a wicked-looking black blade.

[From.GetBestName] suddenly exclaims, surging towards you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_212;No! Get that thing away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
