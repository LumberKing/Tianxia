- Bloodline Siege Engineer (and others) event does not have an event target, breaking the loc. Might also not create a character properly in all cases; is the gender setup and spawn location correct? Also look at the re-scope to ROOT in the creation; that's not present in Siege Engineer, which can spawn, but is present in others, which dont't spawn.
- Random nicknames (Red-cheeks, etc.) might need restrictions.
- Check if the Hanami is too late in the year.

- Ancestor Worship carved idol should perhaps have different loc for Chinese/Japanese characters.
- TOG.7023 has the wrong scope for the character (ROOT instead of) in the loc.
- Yearn for lover's embrace event might have the wrong gender in the rejection response (check for "wife").
- Adultery scandal from WoL seduction should sanity check if the lover has become a concubine or spouse between when it is discovered and when the event fires.
- "Lover informs about pregnancy" and others' concubines; check if that event is wrong, seeing as there's no "let's hope it's not discovered".
- Make the Council Power faction more popular in Chinese/Japanese realms.
- Consider whether childhood bully event really should give Martial; potentially inconsistent with PCS rework.
- Hanami poetry contests should perhaps not involve (young) children.
- Check tense in Hanami poetry contest loss event.
- Hanami, LNY, Chuseok, Iyomante, Bear Festival events should not change traits of children as the traits awarded are not childhood traits.
- Check for possible unending Hanami/lack of cleanup of Hanami modifier. Some might fail partway through (after invites have gone out?).
- "You deserve a good name!" nickname event seems to pick a weird province for the "the X of Y" nicknames.
- Event 1980 might be missing a blocker for people with Conclave, but it is nice to keep it.
- Artefact inheritance for holders of viceroyalties seems to be wrong; they go to the liege.
- "my family history" -> "my family's history".
- Maybe allow wrong religion Court Chaplains for Chinese/Japanese characters, but block conversion in that case?
- HF.21117 speaks of hymns (when the target is Zealous/Cynical?), which is nonsensical for many religions.

- Increase AI willingness to join PR faction against actual regency liege with quite a lot of council authority.
- Check punctuation in MoH update events.
- Courtiers marrying secluded characters should join the seclusion.
- "Pickled boar head" in seclusion event; check if there are sensible blockers!
- Again make sure that the default succession law in Japan and China is Agnatic.
- WotRS faith poem is missing the name of the faith in the loc.

- DLC warning in secret faith adoption even when eligible (Shinto -> Shugendo).
- Link Japanese/Wako/Emishi/Yamato namelists properly.
- Council Power defaults in China/Japan/etc. should favour vassals.
- Prevent multiple simultaneous MoH revolts for the same kingdom in the same realm.
- Remove gender bias in succession voting for Minahasans.
- Reverse gender bias in succession voting for Minangkabau.
- Make titles granted by the Tenno swap away from True Cognatic unless he's got Full SoW, the target has Equality, or the target has Full SoW.
- Check for possible stray pixels between c_nedong/c_taktse and c_qingyang or issue with Buddhist HWs not checking adjacency properly.
- Consider maybe flipping prestige reward for saying that Shirabyoshi with swords are neat if male with a male mentor that is dismissive.
- Re-localise "Summon lodge commander" power for WotRS.

- Random rulers in China/Japan/etc should probably not hear about Christian pilgrimage sites due to saints.
- Inform WotRS members of the death of a Hatamoto whenever there was seven of them prior to the death.
- War of Honor does not seem to be valid against independent rulers of other realms even when External Vassal Wars are allowed and you have the quest. Possibly can_use_gui issue?
- "I no longer have the patience to negotiate" event does not have add_trait_partially_wroth_effect!
- Check if the WotRS decision to offer to take someone as a student is broken.
- Remove "Get a Mentor" quest on rank up.
- "X tried to convert me to their vile heresy" and Chinese/Japanese/Dharmic religions.
- "is widely renown" should be "is widely renowned".
- Check why "has an adult unlanded son not in the line of succession" fails for asking for land for sons; is it is_heir being weird with Gavelkind even if the son isn't actually inheriting land?
- Check random flipping to reformed religion ahead of reformation; Korean Buddhist (?) to Reformed Muist has likely been seen (could possibly also be Chuseok conversion).
- Improve on trigger for random death events; should probably not happen as frequently for close relatives of landed characters (even if they shouldn't have complete protection...).
- Courtiers approaching lieges about conversion shouldn't be called heretics if they're not actually heretics/parents of ROOT's religion.
- Check problem with primogeniture allow when not a viceroyalty; it should be allowed if various laws are in place regardless of top liege's laws...
- Fix loc (and general firing?) of "Courtier tried to convert other courtier to heresy" event when the religion is not actually a heresy.
- Block children from pressing claims on China if eligible for CI.
- SoA.4031 claims it'll make you noreligion (Shugendo -> Shinto, Koshin -> Shugendo, Buddhist -> Hindu). Tooltip error inherited from CleanSlate?

- Gain title from liege ambition does not complete when being granted a title by liege.

- Check blank "Shinto" in FotK currency gain.
- Swaying/Antagonizing shouldn't fail if you and the target are secluded in the same place.
- No child naming event for children of concubines; investigate!
- Japan's Vassal Wars law might reset on succession if heir is landed; check if this also causes the Tanistry issue, flag the heir in an on_death event, and ensure they keep the laws.

- Shenist templegfx is broken; it shows a black holding box.
- Secluded meditation should not prevent shutting the gates.

- You should perhaps not be able to call for your Court Physician when your landed spouse is sick.
- Non-dynastic rulers that take over pretender empires and remain CI proclaim the end of the old dynasty and the start of the old dynasty; the latter should be the new dynasty.
- Evoke Sympathy event capitalizes "Pagans", which it shouldn't.
- The quest giver/rewarded for the Shinto pilgrimage shows the Tenno's portrait despite the Tenno not being the character in question or even being a member of the FotK.
- Hanami modifier (left from a Hanami that should have ended long ago) is not cleared out when a war starts; is it perhaps another modifier that's cleared out?
- The ending of a Permanent Regency should perhaps partially depower the council; maybe stop short of war declaration.
- Unreformed Jurchen and Tengri should have Defensive Attrition.
- Female Shinto Court Chaplain uses the Christian appearance; likely caused by graphical culture setup being wrong (should match religion's graphical culture), and likely present for other (female?) councillors.
- FotK "Become Japanese Monastic Feudal" is not showing up (Japanese Shinto Japanese Feudal ruler). It shows up when JMF; there's probably an incorrect NOT.

- soh.2767 fires when it shouldn't (Secretly Shugendo Koshin student + Shinto mentor).
- Failure to track down White Stag event possibly gives Arbitrary without add_trait_partially_arbitrary_effect; investigate!
- "My councubine is pregnant; great!" event and "My concubine is pregnant, but I was away?" event can fire at the same time on some occasions (child is legitimate in observed scenario).
- The WotRS "Write a poem for someone" shows the wrong event target in the follow-ups (second target picked, first or third shows up) except the final "What did they think of it?" event.

- "Exalted among Men" -> "Exalted among Women" for women?
- "Master of the Hunt" -> "Mistress of the Hunt" when held by a woman.

- Glitterhoof should side with the liege when voting in succession voting.
- Mittens the Kitten should want a subservient liege, because cat.
- Replace religious trading community modifier icon with something more trade-y.
- Enlisting of Ronin should only be allowed as a primary war participant, unless it is consistent with WL event troops; also goes for Hwarang Righteous Armies.
- Event 75004 speaks of "the Church", which makes little sense for non-Christians.
- "Poachers will be eliminated!" event has some weird RootMySpymaster or some such in the loc.
- Maybe increase AI Hwarang joining a bit.
- Maybe allow slightly older characters to join the Hwarang.
- Former EoCs (and vassals?) that create a pretender when e_china changes hands do not get an MoH modifier right away.
- Check if Chinese Subjugation is properly set up; a Koreanic Buddhist is waging such a war against a Jurchen Buddhist over their capital kingdom; would be okay if it's just the kingdom thing.
- WoL.11300 fired twice in very quick succession; investigate what's up with that.
- Koshin mentors with Shinto students claim their students are "not followers of the main religions of the WotRS" in soh.2764; actually, they are!
- Try to randomize at least one proper attraction target in soh.3314.
- Shugendo is "too foreign" in event soh.2762; it actually isn't!
- Minangkabau (Minahasan?) culture does not unlock True Cognatic; arguably, is should...
- WoL.301 refers to the county's capital if the target is a baron; it should be the target's capital.
- DW orgies should not speak of "the Great Serpent" everywhere.

- spymaster.202 can fire with no vassals (and no factions).
- DW "Attempt to Abduct" power seems to disappear if the target dies.
- "Other claim" wars might invalidate for JB vs. the Tenno; they shouldn't, but they should only be valid if the target isn't Yamashiro.
- "Become Japanese Bureaucracy" is a poor name for the decision; re-localise it!
- The event picture for random Chinese/Japanese conversion should be changed when the county converts to your public religion; that is a positive event, so the burning house is weird.
- It appears to be impossible to faction for secondary titles (count vassal vs. duke liege, secondary duchy, both Japanese Feudal).
- The Breton Company seems to be within the diplo range of Kai; it really shouldn't be!
- The Rus Company seems to be within the diplo range of Kai.
- The Turkic Band seems to be within the diplo range of Kai.
- Japanese government change decisions should list what the governments' inherent features are in the tooltip.
- Japanese government switching should perhaps be limited to once per ruler.

- "Wife poisons son" event fires even for wives that shouldn't care (Content) against sons that aren't ahead of theirs in the line of succession.
- EXILE_IMPRISONED_INTERACTION_VOTE needs loc.
- "My brother and sister in darkness" (start of DW orgy); should only be one of the two.
- No missions seem to be given to DW leader.
- "Liege buys new surgical tools" and its follow-up shows a concubine rather than the liege; is it actually properly involving the liege?
- Divine Ancestry rel head titles can be inherited by non-Divine Ancestry heirs of the correct religion; destroy it on_death if that would be the case.
- Event 100231's loc gets weird when pluralized for Japanese titles. Maybe make it singular?

- Glitterhoof armour event uses ROOT's name where it should use the horse's name.
- "Lover suggests you should sleep together" refrences ROOT rather than ROOT's spouse when it comes to who might discover it.
- Swaying events work on prisoners if you elect to not stop; they should not be able to be involved in such things!
- You can apparently get the "SR society member leaves holy book for you" event with your own religion; is something broken?
- SR communities remain utter nonsense; about 90 % of Japan's provinces flipped religion *all at once* thanks to them!
- Check ai_flag_refuse_conversion and religious conversion.
- MNM.3410 should have an explicit blocker for Zealous.
- Ningdu unit position might be weird.
- Hide more CBs; evaluate can_use vs. can_use_gui.
- "Is a pilgrim" should really be "Is on a pilgrimage or other journey".
- Empowered GCs should get to wage subjugation wars regardless of tier.
- Check that MNM.70202 shows that you'll get the Kinslayer trait ahead of time.
