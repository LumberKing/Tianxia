Event issue:
- Look for Court Physician option does not show up in the "My relative is sick!" event.
- RIP.11053 has no event target and possibly no character in some cases (villager drunkard seems to be one).
- Consider whether childhood bully event really should give Martial; potentially inconsistent with PCS rework.
- Hanami, LNY, Chuseok, Iyomante, Bear Festival events should not change traits of children as the traits awarded are not childhood traits.
- "Lover informs about pregnancy" and others' concubines; check if that event is wrong, seeing as there's no "let's hope it's not discovered".
- Check for possible unending Hanami/lack of cleanup of Hanami modifier. Some might fail partway through (at some point after invites). Might only be night-time ones.
- Consider maybe flipping prestige reward for saying that Shirabyoshi with swords are neat if male with a male mentor that is dismissive.
- Improve on trigger for random death events; should probably not happen as frequently for close relatives of landed characters (even if they shouldn't have complete protection...).
- Swaying/Antagonizing shouldn't fail if you and the target are secluded in the same place.
- Check if "Incestuous Adulterer/Adulteress" is applied properly; might be applied when it shouldn't be.
- No child naming event for children of concubines; investigate!
- You should perhaps not be able to call for your Court Physician when your landed spouse is sick.
- The quest giver/rewarded for the Shinto pilgrimage shows the Tenno's portrait despite the Tenno not being the character in question or even being a member of the FotK.
- Hanami modifier (left from a Hanami that should have ended long ago) is not cleared out when a war starts; is it perhaps another modifier that's cleared out?
- TOG.7020 (ancestor worship lover) does not properly check for orientation of target character.
- soh.2767 fires when it shouldn't (Secretly Shugendo Koshin student + Shinto mentor).
- Failure to track down White Stag event possibly gives Arbitrary without add_trait_partially_arbitrary_effect; investigate!
- "My councubine is pregnant; great!" event and "My concubine is pregnant, but I was away?" event can fire at the same time on some occasions (child is legitimate in observed scenario).
- The WotRS "Write a poem for someone" shows the wrong event target in the follow-ups (second target picked, first or third shows up) except the final "What did they think of it?" event.
- Victim relative in "Songs of Anguish" should need lower Intrigue than the would-be victim.
- Ancestor Worship seems to sometimes lead to multiple "An interesting courtier arrived; did the Ancestors send them?" events.
- WoL.11300 fired twice in very quick succession; investigate what's up with that.
- Koshin mentors with Shinto students claim their students are "not followers of the main religions of the WotRS" in soh.2764; actually, they are!
- Shugendo is "too foreign" in event soh.2762; it actually isn't!
- WoL.1012 fires in the wrong scope (should fire for the spouse of FROM's lover, not for FROM).
- spymaster.202 can fire with no vassals (and no factions).
- The event picture for random Chinese/Japanese conversion should be changed when the county converts to your public religion; that is a positive event, so the burning house is weird.
- Marshals (and other councillors) should not approach imprisoned lieges about nifty ideas.
- The option to kill a child to kill demon hunters has several "Relative dies" random options; weird.
- "Lover suggests you should sleep together" refrences ROOT rather than ROOT's spouse when it comes to who might discover it.
- Swaying events work on prisoners if you elect to not stop; they should not be able to be involved in such things!
- You can apparently get the "SR society member leaves holy book for you" event with your own religion; is something broken?
- Check that MNM.70202 shows that you'll get the Kinslayer trait ahead of time. Issue might also be present elsewhere.

Loc issue:
- Ancestor Worship carved idol should perhaps have different loc for Chinese/Japanese characters.
- TOG.7023 has the wrong scope for the character (ROOT instead of) in the loc.
- Yearn for lover's embrace event might have the wrong gender in the rejection response (check for "wife").
- Check tense in Hanami poetry contest loss event.
- "X tried to convert me to their vile heresy" and Chinese/Japanese/Dharmic religions.
- Courtiers approaching lieges about conversion shouldn't be called heretics if they're not actually heretics/parents of ROOT's religion.
- Fix loc (and general firing?) of "Courtier tried to convert other courtier to heresy" event when the religion is not actually a heresy.
- MNM.4417 "The wisdom of [blank] is" seems to have broken loc.
- Non-dynastic rulers that take over pretender empires and remain CI proclaim the end of the old dynasty and the start of the old dynasty; the latter should be the new dynasty.
- Evoke Sympathy event capitalizes "Pagans", which it shouldn't.
- Title for MNM.9800 is wrong ("The Remains of the First Pope" for the Classic of Poetry); might be individual for different artefacts?
- "Songs of Anguish" event speaks of "Hell", which is nonsensical in many places.
- "Exalted among Men" -> "Exalted among Women" for women?
- "Master of the Hunt" -> "Mistress of the Hunt" when held by a woman.
- Event 75004 speaks of "the Church", which makes little sense for non-Christians.
- "Poachers will be eliminated!" event has some weird RootMySpymaster or some such in the loc.
- WoL.301 refers to the county's capital if the target is a baron; it should be the target's capital.
- spymaster.105 claims the plot was investigated in "All realm provinces".
- "Become Japanese Bureaucracy" is a poor name for the decision; re-localise it!
- Event RIP.4046 fired and said that "my liege" would be upset while talking about a concubine. Probably a scoping error.
- "My brother and sister in darkness" (start of DW orgy); should only be one of the two.
- "Liege buys new surgical tools" and its follow-up shows a concubine rather than the liege; is it actually properly involving the liege?
- DW Grand Ritual blessings should perhaps have different loc for non-Satanists.
- "the landscape around <capital>, particularly around <capital>" in HF.21117 is weird (counts only?).
- "Cursed infidels!" in the "Crusade ended in victory" event makes little sense when the defender is completely unrelated.
- "Is a pilgrim" should really be "Is on a pilgrimage or other journey".

Misc issues:
- Artefact inheritance for holders of viceroyalties seems to be wrong; they go to the liege.
- Random nicknames (Red-cheeks, etc.) might need restrictions.
- Link Japanese/Wako/Emishi/Yamato namelists properly.
- Reverse gender bias in succession voting for Minangkabau.
- Secluded meditation should not prevent shutting the gates.
- Female Shinto Court Chaplain uses the Christian appearance; likely caused by graphical culture setup being wrong (should match religion's graphical culture), and likely present for other (female?) councillors.
- It is possible to show interest in DWs and SRSes before the 90 day society joining window is up.
- Glitterhoof should side with the liege when voting in succession voting.
- Mittens the Kitten should want a subservient liege, because cat.
- It appears to be impossible to faction for secondary titles (count vassal vs. duke liege, secondary duchy, both Japanese Feudal).
- Japanese government change decisions should list what the governments' inherent features are in the tooltip.
- Japanese government switching should perhaps be limited to once per ruler.
- Nomadic succession works very poorly with secular rel heads; it doesn't force a co-religionist successor, so the rel head title will easily get destroyed.
- WoL adultery fallout events might not fire or might be broken in various ways.
- SR communities remain utter nonsense; about 90 % of Japan's provinces flipped religion *all at once* thanks to them!
- Hide more CBs; evaluate can_use vs. can_use_gui.
