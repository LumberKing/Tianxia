- MoH update event speaks of ROOT, should be FROM.
- Bloodline Siege Engineer (and others) event does not have an event target, breaking the loc. Might also not create a character properly in all cases; is the gender setup and spawn location correct?
- Short name for Seven Thousand Samurai, possibly other Tianxia mercs.
- Random nicknames (Red-cheeks, etc.) might need restrictions.
- Remove swaying restriction towards temporal rel heads.
- Check if Chinese princess trait update fails to remove the trait when the princess is unmarried and abroad.
- Check if the Hanami is too late in the year.
- Japanese council voting seems to consider the imprisonment of random people to be "high treason". The protection of the Tenno/knockoff can probably largely be removed.
- Incorrect use of "black shaman" in Desecrators recruitment; check custom_loc.
- "the messenger" for DWs can come from a random society, as opposed to the target DW society.
- EXECUTION_INTERACTION_VOTE needs loc.
- Check if "Knock them out!" option for DW desecration uses Martial or PCS; should be PCS!
- Allow the temple picked for DW desecration to be from a related religion if Chinese/Japanese enough.
- Look for Court Physician option does not show up in the "My relative is sick!" event.
- RIP.11053 has no event target; possibly no character.
- Tsuhgime does not look proper; can't be spelled out in Hiragana!
- Hanami sparring session should have its random_list hidden.
- Ancestor Worship carved idol should perhaps have different loc for Chinese/Japanese characters.
- TOG.7023 has the wrong scope for the character (ROOT instead of) in the loc.
- Yearn for lover's embrace event might have the wrong gender in the rejection response (check for "wife").
- Adultery scandal from WoL seduction should sanity check if the lover has become a concubine or spouse between when it is discovered and when the event fires.
- "Lover informs about pregnancy" and others' concubines; check if that event is wrong, seeing as there's no "let's hope it's not discovered".
- Check if "End plot" is softcoded; if so, make sure you can't target liege(s).
- Make the Council Power faction more popular in Chinese/Japanese realms.
- Consider whether childhood bully event really should give Martial; potentially inconsistent with PCS rework.
- Hanami poetry contests should perhaps not involve (young) children.
- Check tense in Hanami poetry contest loss event.

- Hanami, LNY, Chuseok, Iyomante, Bear Festival events should not change traits of children as the traits awarded are not childhood traits.
- Check for possible unending Hanami/lack of cleanup of Hanami modifier. Some might fail partway through (after invites have gone out?).
- Vassal wars should perhaps be allowed in Japan in 769; the realm isn't necessarily *that* centralized.
- "You deserve a good name!" nickname event seems to pick a weird province for the "the X of Y" nicknames.
- Event 1980 might be missing a blocker for people with Conclave, but it is nice to keep it.
- Artefact inheritance for holders of viceroyalties seems to be wrong; they go to the liege.
- "my family history" -> "my family's history".
- Maybe allow wrong religion Court Chaplains for Chinese/Japanese characters, but block conversion in that case?
- HF.21117 speaks of hymns (when the target is Zealous/Cynical?), which is nonsensical for many religions.
- Spear-throwing contest from War focus might not be sensible with some cultures/etc.
- Kill revolters, revolter commanders if the defender is an AI and wins.
- Inform WotRS members on mentors dying, leaving society, becoming imprisoned/incapable, etc.
- Increase AI willingness to join PR faction against actual regency liege with quite a lot of council authority.
- Check punctuation in MoH update events.
- Courtiers marrying secluded characters should join the seclusion.
- "Pickled boar head" in seclusion event; check if there are sensible blockers!
- Again make sure that the default succession law in Japan and China is Agnatic.
- WotRS faith poem is missing the name of the faith in the loc.
- "As mu vassals" in Hanami welcome event.
- No "the Devil" nickname in Japan, China, etc.
- Generally check on AI Ag-Cog willingness; France has gone Ag-Cog pretty quickly...
- Sakahito is probably not a female Yamato name.
- ZE.12110 speaks of alms, which is nonsensical.
- DLC warning in secret faith adoption even when eligible (Shinto -> Shugendo).
- Link Japanese/Wako/Emishi/Yamato namelists properly.

- Prevent multiple simultaneous MoH revolts for the same kingdom in the same realm.
- Remove gender bias in succession voting for Minahasans.
- Reverse gender bias in succession voting for Minangkabau.
- Farmer girl/farrier's apprentice event seems to add Homosexual when it shouldn't (and maybe misses it when it should add it?).
- Make titles granted by the Tenno swap away from True Cognatic unless he's got Full SoW, the target has Equality, or the target has Full SoW.
- Check for possible stray pixels between c_nedong/c_taktse and c_qingyang or issue with Buddhist HWs not checking adjacency properly.
- War of Honor quest is being handed out against targets inside the same realm despite vassal wars being blocked.
- Block "Falsely confess faith" if liege doesn't care.
- Consider maybe flipping prestige reward for saying that Shirabyoshi with swords are neat if male with a male mentor that is dismissive.
- Re-localise "Summon lodge commander" power for WotRS.
- Target for "Smear rival" event chain for the WotRS is from a random society; should be WotRS.
- Random rulers in China/Japan/etc should probably not hear about Christian pilgrimage sites due to saints.
- Inform WotRS members of the death of a Hatamoto whenever there was seven of them prior to the death.
- War of Honor does not seem to be valid against independent rulers of other realms even when External Vassal Wars are allowed and you have the quest. Possibly can_use_gui issue?
- Block Secret Bears from spawning as part of the Imperial Family; it's not Amaterasu's will!
- "I no longer have the patience to negotiate" event does not have add_trait_partially_wroth_effect!
- Check if the WotRS decision to offer to take someone as a student is broken.
- Remove "Get a Mentor" quest on rank up.
- "X tried to convert me to their vile heresy" and Chinese/Japanese/Dharmic religions.
- "is widely renown" should be "is widely renowned".
- Check why "has an adult unlanded son not in the line of succession" fails for asking for land for sons; is it is_heir being weird with Gavelkind even if the son isn't actually inheriting land?
- Fellow member of WotRS caught by Court Chaplain; should not fire unless part of the same secret society!
- Check random flipping to reformed religion ahead of reformation; Korean Buddhist (?) to Reformed Muist has likely been seen (could possibly also be Chuseok conversion).
- Improve on trigger for random death events; should probably not happen as frequently for close relatives of landed characters (even if they shouldn't have complete protection...).
- Courtiers approaching lieges about conversion shouldn't be called heretics if they're not actually heretics/parents of ROOT's religion.
- Check problem with primogeniture allow when not a viceroyalty; it should be allowed if various laws are in place regardless of top liege's laws...
- Fix loc (and general firing?) of "Courtier tried to convert other courtier to heresy" event when the religion is not actually a heresy.
- Block children from pressing claims on China if eligible for CI.
- SoA.4031 claims it'll make you noreligion (Shugendo -> Shinto).
- The Tenno (and others with a Tanistry-based law?) seems to swap to Tanistry on_startup; add a failsafe event.
- Gain title from liege ambition does not complete when being granted a title by liege.
- Dharmic Wisdom for the FotK (and the Bön MO?) should be renamed.
- Depose Tenno faction should result in vassals being able to declare war + an empowered council unless led by an Imperial Family member.
- Wives/concubines lying about their children's father should need to have Intrigue diff, not just plain Intrigue.
- Maybe block snake pit execution in China/Japan/etc.
- MoH should be harder to keep up (with middle setting) if the realm is small, particularly for e_china.
- "I will never allow her/him to turn into a savage!" loc makes no sense when the "Liege asks for Faith focus for ward" event fires with a co-religionist liege.
- Check blank "Shinto" in FotK currency gain.
- Swaying/Antagonizing shouldn't fail if you and the target are secluded in the same place.
- No child naming event for children of concubines; investigate!
- Japan's Vassal Wars law might reset on succession if heir is landed; check if this also causes the Tanistry issue, flag the heir in an on_death event, and ensure they keep the laws.

- Nakhi graphical culture (early bodpagfx?) women have grey hair and wrinkles at an early age.
