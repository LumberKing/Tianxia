# Historical Yamato/Japanese characters 1000008700-1000010699, 1000011900-1000012299, 1000012700-1000012999, 1000013200-1000014999
# First unused index: 1000014043

# Swap from Yamato to Japanese around 800-850 (for the Imperial Family, it would be the children of Junna and Ninmyo), but let people alive at that point remain Yamato since it is a parent culture and thus not a cause for rebellion

# JAPAN REVISION:

# - Add missing spouses with known parents ("Daughter/Sister of X")
# - Validate dates someone gets a title against https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person as many might be from the lunar calendar
# - Verify Dazaifu holders
# - Verify bloodline dates
# - Verify that all Permanent Regents hold at least one county in every (playable) date they're the Permanent Regent
