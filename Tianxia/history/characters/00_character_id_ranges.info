### Character ID range reservations

### Instructions:
# - Put your reserved ID ranges both here and at the top of relevant file, and also put a note with [highest used ID + 1] at the top of the file.
# - Reserve at least 100 IDs at a time. We want decent groupings of characters rather than a few here and a few there, and some margins for future characters is good.
# - If you are working on a culture with a lot of characters, only reserve 1000 IDs at a time (or 1000 + rounding to nearest even thousand). We don't want a bunch of reserved IDs that never get used.
# - Files with "_old" in the name have not yet been moved to new character ID ranges.
# - Historical characters should go in culture_historical.txt (e.g. han_historical.txt), except in special cases when it is prudent to put them in a separate file that doesn't respect culture (e.g. imperial_family_soh.txt, since the relevant characters will be both Yamato and Japanese yet make sense together).
# - Fictional placeholder characters should go in culture_placeholder.txt (e.g. andamanese_placeholders.txt).
# - Don't create new fictional placeholder character if you can repurpose old ones that aren't currently used.
# - If you change the culture of just one or two characters, you don't have to move them to the proper file, but if you make significant changes you should do so and should also give them new IDs in an appropraite range.
# - Files without "old" or "tianxia" in the name are vanilla files. They should not be re-indexed, and should not changed except in the following circumstances:
#	- You are making a change for consistency reasons (e.g. updating temple names to be granted on_death).
#	- You are making a change for mechanical reasons (e.g. giving the Xia and Liao pretender bloodlines so that they can create pretender empires more easily).
#	- You are making a small change for historical reasons (e.g. you add the correct date of birth/death for someone).
#	- You have received explicit permission to make a particular change. Vanilla takes precedence.
# - Ensure that you ALWAYS update ALL references to a character if you change their ID, both in the character history files and elsewhere.

### Currently reserved ID ranges (note: the forum thread with reserved ID ranges hasn't been updated for years, so we're ignoring various ranges reserved there):
