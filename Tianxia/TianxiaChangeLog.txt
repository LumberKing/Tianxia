Open Alpha 6.0.1 (WTMR) - 10/09/2019
--------------------------------------

Patch:

- Added a game rule governing whether the Jurchen get event troops when forming e_jurchen_china.
- Buddhist pretender emperors can now claim to also be the Samrat Chakravartin.
- Blocked Chinese/Japanese Imperial rulers and the lieges of Japanese Imperial rulers (i.e. the Shogun) from forming Russia, restoring the ERE (after the Fourth Crusade), restoring the RE, forming/restoring the Bulgarian Empire and forming the Slavic Union. None of these rulers should care about those things, and it could break things.
- Holy orders can no longer build castles in realms where the top liege is Chinese/Japanese Feudal or where any vassal is the Tenno, as neither China nor Japan nor a realm claiming the throne of China should look kindly on someone else squatting in their land.
- Updated the colourmaps and the trees, thanks to Harley1994.
- Incorporated the "Fake Mapmodes" mod by LordPeter, and added two new map modes; one related to the Grace system and China's interests, and one showing the capital holding type in a province (mostly for development purposes).
- Adjusted the holding setup (type and amount) and province religion in some areas.
- Adjusted the starting culture and religion in some areas.

	- Taoist <-> unreformed Shenist (if no reformation has happened), if Chinese
	- Buddhist <-> unreformed Shenist (if no reformation has happened), if Chinese
	- Taoist <-> HF-Reformed Shenist (if "Chinese enough"), if Chinese

	- Taoist <-> HF-Reformed Thanist (if "Chinese enough"), if Viet

- A bunch of Japanese artifacts that previously required you to be Shinto or Japanese Buddhist now require Shinto or Japonic Buddhist.
- Buddhist Chinese Imperial rulers can no longer order the creation of a holy order to fight the enemies of Buddhism, as they're already claiming that religion doesn't really matter.
- Moved some of the holy sites for the Taoist, Shenist, Muist, Thanist, Ryukyuan, Melanesian, Kaharingan, and Sanamahist religions.
- Gave Mandate of Heaven revolters access to the Chinese Reconquest and Chinese Subjugation CBs if they win their revolt.
- Lowered Indonesian conversion willingness to Islam early on.
- Successful Mandate of Heaven revolters will now usurp the relevant kingdom title if it is held by a vassal of the realm they're revolting against.
- Unreformed Muist, Shenist, Thanist, and Ryukyuan pagans no longer get upset when you increase tribal organization.
- Buddhists now approve of the Heirloom Seal of the Realm.
- Adjusted the Mandate of Heaven penalties China suffers when someone creates a pretender empire.

- Added localisation to shinto_become_buddhist, its _desc, and the Buddhist counterpart.
- The new ruler of China will now only freely usurp the capital and your tributaries if he is Chinese Imperial.
- Fixed a couple of Silk Road path errors.
- Pretender Emperors of China and the people that support them or are under their sway should no longer feel that it is appropriate to name their artifacts after the dynasty that rules China itself.
- Chinese Imperial and Japanese Imperial rulers are now properly limited to holding just one empire title (holding more than one title can cause various issues).
- The Nile is no longer missing or broken south of Egypt.
- Fixed Kyiatong being rendered as Kyaitong in some places.
- Pretender Emperors of China no longer get to keep being pretenders when converting to an incompatible culture or religion; they need to choose between reconverting and losing pretender status.
- The AI should never value keeping Chinese Imperial over remaining the religious head of a religion.
- Fixed some incorrect starting holdings.
- You should no longer see whether a certain action is going to hurt someone's Mandate of Heaven rating.
