#Special cultural tactics

#All of the KOM cultures are Altaic and get the retreat and ambush tactic (horse archers) from vanilla
#However, Jurchen straight-up has no way of getting Horse Archers (since their cultural retinue is unique and different from the rest of the Altaic group. This is likely developer oversight since there are very few Jurchen characters in vanilla.
#So I have given Jurchen a unique tactic to compensate for this loss. In return, even if they somehow get horse archers, they cannot fire retreat and ambush.
