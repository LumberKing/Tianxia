#Special cultural tactics

#The Mekong Rajas cultures are a bit hard to handle due to having problematic overlap with India. In particular, the most prominent feature of Mainland SEA battle tactics is the use of war elephants, but the Indo-Aryan/Dravidian cultures receive no special cultural tactics. This is further complicated by the fact that there are already some special elephant tactics in the game.
#I'm giving some of them terrain-locked elephantry tactics for the moment but this decision may be subject to change in the future.
#Bamar has been blocked from accessing Mountain Ambush on account of there being almost no relevant terrain in the region compared to Tibet. They instead get the Mon-Khmer tactic on grounds of terrain.
