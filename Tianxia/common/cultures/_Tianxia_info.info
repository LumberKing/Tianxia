General guidelines moving forward:
- Use tabs for indentation, not spaces; it makes searching for stuff much easier.
- Each culture group goes in its own file named 00_<culture_group_name>.txt.
- Alphabetize the namelists and split the rows by letter. Treat non-A-Z letters are the closest A-Z equivalent, even though that's incorrect.
- "modifier = default_culture_modifier" is superfluous; don't add it.
- dynasty_title_names = no is the default, and thus unnecessary.
- prefix = no is the default, and has to do with the patronymic. Don't bother with it.
- from_dynasty_prefix is probably unnecessary for a lot of cultures.
