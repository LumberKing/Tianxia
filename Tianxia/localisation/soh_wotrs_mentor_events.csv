EVTDESC_SOH_2701;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI write to you to request that you become my mentor so that I may learn the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun and prove myself worthy so that I one day may ascend to a higher rank.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[FromFrom.GetSocietyRank] [FromFrom.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2701;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2701;Prove that you're good enough to be my student first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2701;I will do it, if you pay me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_2701;I will do it... for a Favor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_2701;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2702;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt would be a pleasure to mentor you in the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun. I will begin preparing a lesson plan right away.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2702;Sounds good to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2703;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI might be prepared to mentor you in the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun as you ask, but first you will have to show me that you have what it takes to be my student.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2703;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2703;I have nothing to prove to you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2704;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI am a busy [From.GetManWoman] and am uncertain as to whether I would be able to find the time to mentor you. However, in exchange for a small sum of gold I believe I can find the time...\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2704;I suppose that's fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2704;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2705;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI can see why you would want me to mentor you in the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun, and I might be willing to do you that favor, but in that case I would ask a favor in return at a later date...\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2705;I think that's reasonable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2705;Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2706;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYou may have been allowed to join the ranks of the Warriors of the Rising Sun, but that is not sufficient reason for me to teach you. You will have to find someone else to teach you!\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2706;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2707;[From.GetBestName] arrives without delay and eagerly shows me what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of as a warrior. In my experience, new members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun are generally somewhat lacking in skill regardless of their background, but [From.GetBestName] is possibly more skilled than I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2707;I should suggest an even better mentor...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2707;I can probably give [From.GetHerHim] a few tips...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2707;I don't really think I want to teach [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2708;[From.GetBestName] arrives without delay and eagerly shows me what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of as a warrior. While I notice some areas where [From.GetSheHe] might be lacking, [From.GetSheHe] does quite well, and it is clear that those that have given [From.GetBestName] lessons in the past left little for me to help [From.GetHerHim] improve on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2708;I will take [From.GetHerHim] on as a student!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2708;I think this would be a waste of my time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2709;[From.GetBestName] arrives without delay and eagerly shows me what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of as a warrior. I notice some flaws, but also some strengths, and in my opinion [From.GetBestName] is about as skilled as the average new member of the Warriors of the Rising Sun tends to be. I could certainly help [From.GetHerHim] improve a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2709;[From.GetSheHeCap] would be a good student for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2709;I would rather not teach [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2710;[From.GetBestName] arrives without delay and eagerly shows me what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of as a warrior. I notice a few promising areas, but on the whole [From.GetSheHe] is a rather poor warrior, and it would likely take quite some work to help [From.GetHerHim] improve to the point where [From.GetSheHe] would perform adequately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2710;I'm willing to teach [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2710;Teaching [From.GetHerHim] would be too much work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2711;[From.GetBestName] arrives without delay and eagerly shows me what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of as a warrior. To call [From.GetHerHis] performance "bad" would be charitable, to say the least, and it would doubtlessly be a major undertaking to make [From.GetHerHim] perform at even the lowest level I would deem acceptable for a Warrior of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2711;I do like a challenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2711;[From.GetSheHeCap] is not worth my time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2712;Despite giving [From.GetBestName] a fair opportunity to prove [From.GetHerselfHimself] worthy of being my student, which certainly was not out of order, [From.GetSheHe] does not agree to show me what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of. It seems [From.GetSheHe] was under the impression that all [From.GetSheHe] had to do was ask.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2712;In that case, I must refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2713;It seems I have impressed [From.GetBestName] with my skills as [From.GetSheHe] informs me that [From.GetSheHe] is uncertain [From.GetSheHe] could teach me much. [From.GetSheHeCap] thinks that [better_mentor.GetBestName] might be a better mentor, and has offered to ask [better_mentor.GetHerHim] to become my mentor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2713;Sounds like a plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2713;No, I want you to teach me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2714;Though I had expected [From.GetBestName] to accept my offer to try to get [better_mentor.GetBestName] to teach [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetBestName] surprises me by demanding that I mentor [From.GetHerHim] personally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2714;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2714;I don't think that'd be good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2715;While my request seems to have taken [From.GetBestName] by surprise it evidently was a good idea to ask as [From.GetSheHe] has agreed to take me on despite [From.GetHerHis] initial reservations. Perhaps I will not learn as much as I might have been able to learn with another mentor, but I might also be able to prove myself more quickly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2715;I'm sure this will be good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2716;It seems I displeased [From.GetBestName] by insisting that [From.GetSheHe] should mentor me personally as [From.GetSheHe] has refused to entertain the notion and has rescinded [From.GetHerHis] previous offer to help me get another mentor. It seems I will have to approach someone else in person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2716;That was unexpected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2717;A messenger has arrived from [FromFrom.GetBestName], bearing a message telling me that [From.GetBestName] is an exceptionally gifted warrior and that it might be a good idea for me to mentor [From.GetHerHim] as [FromFrom.GetBestName] is uncertain whether [FromFrom.GetSheHe] could teach [From.GetBestName] much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2717;I would be happy to teach them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2717;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2718;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI hereby inform you that I have seen fit to accept you as my student, as requested by [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]. I hope that this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2718;I look forward to learning from you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2719;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI hereby inform you that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has accepted me as [FromFrom.GetHerHis] student. I thank you for your help in arranging for it to happen.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2719;It was my pleasure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2720;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nWhile [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] speaks highly of you I do not think it would be in my interest to mentor you as [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] has requested.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2720;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2721;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nDespite your letter to [FromFrom.GetBestName] [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has refused to mentor me. I ask that you reconsider mentoring me, as I initially requested.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2721;I suppose I can do it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2721;I don't think that would be a good idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2722;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIf [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] is unwilling to mentor you then I am prepared to do so. You certainly deserve an opportunity to prove yourself.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2722;I'm glad to hear that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2723;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI am surprised that [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] is unwilling to mentor you. However, though I understand your desire to get a mentor, I am not prepared to mentor you personally at this time.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2723;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2724;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYou have performed quite well, and I would definitely be willing to mentor you so that you may learn a few minor things that would be good for you to know.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2724;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2725;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYour performance was not particularly impressive, but I am still willing to mentor you so that you may become truly worthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2725;Well, that's fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2726;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nWhile your performance was decent enough I must say that I would rather not mentor you. You will have to find someone else to take you on.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2726;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2727;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYour performance was not particularly impressive, and I therefore have no interest in mentoring you. I wish you better luck elsewhere.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2727;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2728;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nWhile I am surprised to learn that you would go as far as to demand money in exchange for mentoring me, I think it is an acceptable trade.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2728;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2729;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI think it is quite dishonorable of you to demand money in exchange for mentoring met. I will look elsewhere for a mentor.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2729;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2730;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nWhile I am surprised to learn that you would go as far as to demand a Favor in exchange for mentoring me I believe I can accept such an agreement.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2730;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2731;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI think it is quite dishonorable of you to demand a Favor in exchange for mentoring me, and I have no interest in any such arrangement. I will look elsewhere for a mentor.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2731;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2733A;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI am quite happy to know that we now share a mentor in [FromFrom.GetBestName] and look forward to having an opportunity to spend more time together.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2733B;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n[FromFrom.GetBestName] has seen fit to mentor me as I seek to prove myself a worthy Warrior of the Rising Sun. I hope we can be friends, or that we at the very least will not become rivals.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2733C;[Root.GetBestName],\n[FromFrom.GetBestName] will be mentoring me from now on, and I look forward to proving that I am better than you in every way and that you are unfit to be a Warrior of the Rising Sun.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2733;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2733;I sure hope so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2733;You are a fool to oppose me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2734A;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI am quite happy to hear that we now share a mentor in [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] and look forward to spending more time together.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2734B;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI have been told that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has seen fit to mentor you as well. I hope we will get along, and currently see no reason why that should not be possible.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2734C;[Root.GetBestName],\nI hear [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] will be mentoring you. I thank you for giving me the opportunity to prove that I am better than you in every way and that you are unfit to be a Warrior of the Rising Sun.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2734;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2734;I agree with that sentiment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2734;Oh, I look forward to proving the opposite!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2735;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt has come to my attention that you do not yet have a mentor, and I humbly offer to mentor you so that you may advance further in the ranks of the Warriors of the Rising Sun.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[FromFrom.GetSocietyRank] [FromFrom.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2735;That sounds like an excellent idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2735;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2736;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYour offer to mentor me is most definitely welcome, and I see no reason not to accept. I hope that this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2736;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2737;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYour offer to mentor me is very kind, but I think that another mentor would be better for me. I must refuse your offer.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2737;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2741;I am expected to teach [From.GetBestName] how to use a variety of weapons more skillfully while mentoring [From.GetHerHim]. One of those weapons is the sword, which many would consider the most important weapon in the arsenal of any warrior. I should perhaps give [From.GetHerHim] another swordfighting lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2741;"The sword is an elegant weapon...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2741;I have better things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2742;[From.GetBestName], has seen fit to plan a swordfighting lesson for me, stating that it is something that [From.GetSheHe] thinks is a mandatory part of the training that every Warrior of the Rising Sun must undergo and further informing you that the sword is an elegant weapon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2742;"... for a civilized age!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2742;I think I have better things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2743;While other, less civilized, cultures might think that the bow is a weapon that a noble only should use when hunting, the Warriors of the Rising Sun have other opinions on the matter. It would probably not be amiss to spend some time working on [From.GetBestName]'s marksmanship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2743;I should give [From.GetHerHim] a lesson!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2743;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2744;[From.GetBestName], has announced that [From.GetSheHe] think it would be wise for the two of us to dedicate some time towards working on my skill with the bow, stating that it is good for every warrior to be a skilled archer even though there are those that are not Warriors of the Rising Sun that would disagree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2744;An archery lesson sounds good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2744;I can think of things I'd rather do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2745;Though the sword obviously is the weapon that a true Warrior of the Rising Sun should prefer in melee combat there are situations where a spear is more useful, and it would probably be amiss not to give [From.GetBestName] a lesson in how to handle that weapon in case [From.GetSheHe] should need it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2745;I can give a few tips...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2745;Let's not bother with this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2746;Though [From.GetBestName] has told me that the sword is supposed to be my main weapon in melee combat [From.GetSheHe] has also suggested that there are situations where it might be a good idea to use something else, and now [From.GetSheHe] is suggesting that we should spend some time training with a spear since that can be a particularly useful alternative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2746;Sounds good to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2746;I'd rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2747;Though it would not be amiss to spend some time giving [From.GetBestName] a lesson in how to fight on horseback, it would probably also be a good idea to spend some time just working on basic horsemanship as there are those that end up neglecting that to their detriment because they focus too much on mounted combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2747;Saddle my horse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2747;Maybe later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2748;My mentor, [From.GetBestName], suprises me one day by announcing that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that we should spend the day riding and that the day's activities should not involve the use any weapons. Perhaps there is wisdom in that suggestion, as fighting is unlikely to be the only thing I will do from horseback.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2748;Saddle my horse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2748;Maybe later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2749;I have heard that various less civilized cultures look down on a [Root.GetManWoman] using a bow from horseback on the battlefield instead of solely fighting in melee during mounted combat, but I know that the Warriors of the Rising Sun do not share that belief. Perhaps it is time to instruct [From.GetBestName] in mounted archery?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2749;That will be today's lesson!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2749;I don't want to do this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2750;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] intends to focus on mounted archery during our next lesson, stating that it is a perfectly valid approach to combat despite what some foreign barbarians might think. I am of course familiar with using a bow from horseback, but perhaps it would still be a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2750;Sounds good to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2750;No thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2751;The sword is a useful weapon, and is generally what one would expect a warrior to use when fighting a duel on foot or in many other combat circumstances. However, it is also a weapon that can be used on horseback, and it might be a good idea to have a lesson on the subject as part of [From.GetBestName]'s training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2751;It is certainly worthwhile!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2751;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2752;[From.GetBestName] has instructed me to ready my horse and to bring my sword, stating that our next lesson will be on the subject of mounted swordsmanship. Even though I know that the Warriors of the Rising Sun think that fighting on foot when using a sword is the most honorable approach to combat this lesson might still be useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2752;Great idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2752;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2753;Using a spear on horseback is a bit different from using one on foot. It might be valuable to spend some time working on the mounted approach while mentoring [From.GetBestName] as there are sadly warriors who neglect it in favor of other approaches to combat even when those would be actively detrimental.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2753;Time to saddle up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2753;It would be a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2754;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] intends to give me a lesson in how to use a spear in mounted combat. While I already have some idea of how that works it would perhaps not be amiss to spend some time working on it even so as [From.GetBestName] perhaps knows some things I have not heard before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2754;Fetch me a horse and a spear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2754;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2755;Though a Warrior of the Rising Sun is expected to keep a sword within reach at nearly all times and usually also will be keeping other weapons nearby there might it is still possible that a warrior will find themselves without a weapon to use, and perhaps I should train [From.GetBestName] how to fight in such a situation..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2755;Time to put our weapons aside!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2755;This seems unnecessary...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2756;To me surprise, [From.GetBestName] tells me to put my weapons aside when the day's lesson is about to begin, stating that it would be a good idea for me to learn how to fight in unarmed combat should I end up being separated from my weapons for one reason or another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2756;This might be useful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2756;This does not interest me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2757;A Warrior of the Rising Sun is supposed to be honorable at all times, and there are few things as honorable as ensuring that the law is followed at all times. This is probably not unknown to [From.GetBestName], but as [From.GetHerHis] mentor it might be good for me to ensure that [From.GetSheHe] knows this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2757;That will be today's lesson!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2757;I don't have time for this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2758;My mentor, [From.GetBestName], sets some time aside one day to discuss my opinion on the subject of laws and justice. [From.GetSheHeCap] is quite pleased when [From.GetSheHe] hears that the two of us are in agreement on the subject, stating that there are other Warriors of the Rising Sun that have other, incorrect, opinions on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2758;Justice will be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2759;My mentor, [From.GetBestName], sets some time aside one day to discuss my opinion on the subject of laws and justice. I know that all Warriors of the Rising Sun are supposed to be honorable, and that there are those that think that being honorable and following the law is the same thing, but I had not thought too much about it previously.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2759;Justice must prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2759;Honor sometimes requires breaking the law...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2760;While the Warriors of the Rising Sun are open to having members that are not [Root.Religion.GetName] and on rare occasions have permitted members that have followed quite exotic religions, it is clear that most foreign ways are incompatible with being an honorable warrior. It might be wise to instruct [From.GetBestName] about the dangers of foreign ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2760;Their foreign ways must be avoided!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2760;Let's not be too hasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2761;My mentor, [From.GetBestName], seems to be concerned by the fact that foreign barbarians might have religions that are inherently incompatible with being honorable, as [From.GetSheHe] spends a large part of a day talking about the matter and how it is important for all Warriors of the Rising Sun to not be led astray by those following foreign religions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2761;Their foreign ways must be avoided!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2761;Let's not be too hasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2762;My religion has sometimes been something of a sore point when interacting with other Warriors of the Rising Sun as there are those that think that my religion is too foreign to be something that an honorable warrior could follow. As part of mentoring [From.GetBestName] it might be possible to try to make [From.GetHerHim] more open-minded than most.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2762;This is an opportunity...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2762;This would be a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2763;It is well known that my mentor, [From.GetBestName], follows a religion that is quite unusual for a Warrior of the Rising Sun and there are those that think that this makes [From.GetHerHim] inherently dishonorable. However, [From.GetSheHe] has been trying to teach me that the [From.Religion.GetName] religion is not as dishonorable as people might think.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2763;Well, you seem alright to me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2763;Your religion is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2764;My student, [From.GetBestName], is not a follower of one of the main religions of the Warriors of the Rising Sun, and though there are those that think that foreign religions always are dishonorable I have to admit that [From.GetBestName] seems rather honorable. Perhaps [From.GetHerHis] religion is less dishonorable than I have been led to believe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2764;I should keep an open mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2764;[From.GetHerHisCap] ways are wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2765;I was rather surprised to learn that your mentor, [From.GetBestName], is not as prejudiced towards the [Root.Religion.GetName] religion as many other Warriors of the Rising Sun are. [From.GetSheHeCap] has even gone as far as saying that my honor proves that it would be foolish to dismiss an entire religion as being inherently dishonorable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2765;I'm glad to hear that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2766;Both I and [From.GetBestName] follow religions that are quite different from those that most members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun follow, and I am reasonably certain that both of us have faced prejudice as a result. Though our beliefs differ it might be worth setting aside our differences as we are both seen as outsiders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2766;Let's learn from each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2766;[From.GetBestName]'s religion is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2767;Both I and [From.GetBestName] follow religions that are quite different from those that most members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun follow, and I am reasonably certain that both of us have faced prejudice as a result. It is possible that things would be easier for both of us if we set aside our differences, seeing as we are both regarded as outsiders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2767;Let's learn from each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2767;The [Root.Religion.GetName] is the only true religion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2768;[From.GetBestName] and I are both devout followers of the [Root.Religion.GetName] religion, which is something that other Warriors of the Rising Sun often hold against us. Given that it is doubtful that the prejudice we face will disappear anytime soon it is certainly good to know that I am not alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2768;We're in this together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2769;[From.GetBestName] and I are both devout followers of the [Root.Religion.GetName] religion, which is something that other Warriors of the Rising Sun often hold against us. Given that it is doubtful that the prejudice we face will disappear anytime soon it is certainly good to know that I am not alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2769;We're in this together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2770;[From.GetBestName] has been my student for a while now, and I feel that the two of us have become quite close as a result. Perhaps our relationship should change from simply being a relationship between metor and student and take on a more intimate character? It is not completely unheard of for such things to happen, after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2770;I will proposition them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2770;Me and [From.GetHerHim]? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2771;[From.GetBestName] has been mentoring me in the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun for a while, and the two of us have become rather close as a result. Even so, I was taken by surprise when [From.GetSheHe] suggested that perhaps the two of us should have a much more intimate relationship than we currently have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2771;What a lovely idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2771;Me and [From.GetHerHim]? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2772;[From.GetBestName] was quite flattered by my suggestion, and it did not take the two of us a long time to find a secluded location for lovemaking. Though we certainly still need to spend some time on activities related to training [From.GetBestName] to become a better Warrior of the Rising Sun that will definitely not be the only thing we do together in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2772;This is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2773;I approached [From.GetBestName] with the suggestion of a more intimate relationship, but though the two of us have become close [From.GetBestName] courteously but firmly told me that [From.GetSheHe] does not wish for a more intimate relationship and that [From.GetSheHe] thinks such a relationship with [Root.GetHerHis] mentor would be rather improper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2773;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2774;I have been working closely together with [From.GetBestName] for a while now, and both of us definitely enjoy each other's company. Though we might not always be working as closely together in the future I would say we have become friends for life, and that friendship will doubtlessly give me an ally should I ever need one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2774;We shall stand together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2775;I have been working closely together with [From.GetBestName] for a while now, and both of us definitely enjoy each other's company. Though we might not always be working as closely together in the future I would say we have become friends for life, and that friendship will doubtlessly give me an ally should I ever need one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2775;We shall stand together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2776;Personal combat is something that every Warrior of the Rising Sun should be familiar with, but a true Warrior of the Rising Sun should also be a good commander. I should probably spend some time discussing both strategy and tactics while mentoring [From.GetBestName] as a result, rather than just dealing with weaponry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2776;Let's discuss warfare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2776;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2777;My mentor, [From.GetBestName], has told me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that it is time for the two of us to spend some time discussing both strategy and tactics. [From.GetSheHeCap] clearly feels that a true Warrior of the Rising Sun should be as capable at commanding others as [Root.GetSheHe] is at personal combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2777;Sounds like a plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2777;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2778;One day I and [From.GetBestName] pass by a group of shirabyoshi when taking a walk. They are dressed in their traditional outfit, which of course is something that only would be worn by men otherwise. I have seen some entertaining shirabyoshi performances in the past, but at times their outfits, particularly the swords, have felt out of place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2778;Women with swords! How silly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2778;Let's not be too hasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2779;One day when I am taking a walk with [From.GetBestName] we pass by a group of shirabyoshi wearing their traditional outfits. Apparently [From.GetBestName] has a low opinion about those outfits, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] tells you that [From.GetSheHe] does not think they deserve to be walking around carrying swords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2779;I agree with that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2779;Actually, I think you're wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2780;It seems [From.GetBestName] does not share my opinion about shirabyoshi. [From.GetSheHeCap] rather firmly tells me that I am not right when I claim that it is rather silly for them to be carrying swords, and [From.GetSheHe] might even think that they could be skilled enough with them to actually deserve them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2780;[From.GetSheHeCap] is clearly wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2781;One day I and [From.GetBestName] pass by a group of shirabyoshi as we are taking a walk together. They are dressed in their traditional outfit, which would be out of place on any woman who is not a shirabyoshi, and most would probably say the same about their swords. However, maybe they are as worthy of their swords as I am of mine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2781;They sure could be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2781;They aren't warriors...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2782;As I and my mentor, [From.GetBestName], are walking together one day we pass by a group of shirabyoshi wearing their traditional outfits. My mentor comments on the fact that they carry swords at their side and that some would say that shirabyoshi are unworthy of them, but she claims that anyone that has met her should know women certainly can be worthy of swords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2782;You might be right about that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2782;They are not true warriors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2783;It seems my student, [From.GetBestName], does not share my opinion about shirabyoshi, as [From.GetSheHe] angrily says that they make a mockery of true warriors everywhere and that respecting them is uncalled for, since even though I am a female warrior that does not mean that women are suited to be warriors in general.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2783;What a rude thing to day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2784;One day I and [From.GetBestName] pass by a group of shirabyoshi as we are walking together. They are dressed in their traditional outfit, which of course is something that otherwise only would be worn by men, and they also carry swords at their side. Perhaps I should warn my student that she should work hard to prove herself better than them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2784;I really should!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2784;Let's not be hasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2785;As I and [From.GetBestName] are walking together one day we pass by a group of shirabyoshi wearing their traditional outfits, including their swords. [From.GetBestName] takes the opportunity to tell me that I need to work hard to show that I am more worthy of my sword than the shirabyoshi are of theirs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2785;I'll not say anything...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2785;That was rather insulting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2786;It seems that my student, [From.GetBestName], does not share my opinion about shirabyoshi, as [From.GetSheHe] angrily says that I should not be so hasty in dismissing either them or her. She also claims that women can be just as good at fighting as men but that they just do not get the opportunity to prove it very often.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2786;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2787;One day I and [From.GetBestName] pass by a group of shirabyoshi as wa are walking together. They are dressed in their traditional outfit, which of course is something that otherwise only would be worn by men, and they also carry swords at their side, much like me and my student, and it is certainly not something that should be discouraged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2787;We all deserve to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2788;As I and my mentor, [From.GetBestName], are walking together one day we pass by a group of shirabyoshi wearing their traditional outfits. My mentor comments on the fact that they are carrying swords at their side, much like the two of us are, and states that women should be permitted to carry and wield them if they wish to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2788;We all deserve to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2789;I have been a Warrior of the Rising Sun for quite some time, and though the Warriors of the Rising Sun pride themselves on their honor I have always thought that there are times when honor simply is not the most important concern. Perhaps I should make [From.GetBestName] aware of this, even if there are those that would disapprove.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2789;[From.GetSheHeCap] needs to hear this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2789;I think not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2790;I have always been told that a Warrior of the Rising Sun should act with honor at all time, and I had expected my mentor, [From.GetBestName], to share this sentiment. However, [From.GetSheHe] has just seen fit to tell me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that there are times that honor should be ignored in favor of other considerations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2790;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2790;This is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2791;My attempt to teach [From.GetBestName] that honor is not always of utmost importance has gone poorly. [From.GetSheHeCap] rather firmly told me that [From.GetSheHe] strongly disagrees with this sentiment, and though [From.GetSheHe] does not seem to hold what I said against me I doubt I will be able to convince [From.GetHerHim] to see things my way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2791;Unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2792;I and [From.GetBestName] have come to dislike each another quite a bit since I first started mentoring [From.GetHerHim]. I cannot simply stop mentoring [From.GetHerHim] because I dislike [From.GetHerHim], and I am not prepared to declare [From.GetHerHim] worthy of being a full Warrior of the Rising Sun just to get rid of [From.GetHerHim], but maybe I could seriously injure [From.GetHerHim] in a duel...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2792;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2792;I think not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2793;I and [From.GetBestName] do not exactly see eye-to-eye, and I suspect that both of us would like nothing more than to be rid of one another. [From.GetSheHeCap] has now suggested a practice duel to first blood, and though it would be unwise to try to kill [From.GetHerHim] I could try to harm [From.GetHerHim] quite a bit if I accept the challenge...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2793;Challenge accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2793;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2794;It seems [From.GetBestName] has no interest in my proposed practice duel. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] saw through my plan to push things as far as I could without actively killing [From.GetHerHim] and elected not to take the risk, or perhaps [From.GetSheHe] is just a coward that does not deserve as good a teacher as me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2794;I think it is cowardice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2795;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood does not go the way I had intended for it to go. In fact, it goes about as poorly as it could go, short of my student killing me. [From.GetSheHeCap] easily avoids my attacks and quickly injures me in a major way. If the duel had not been to first blood, [From.GetSheHe] could easily have killed me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2795;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2796;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood goes about as well as I had hoped. [From.GetSheHeCap] makes a few feeble attempts to wound me that I easily avoid, and I quickly manage to inflict a grievious wound on [From.GetHerHim] despite [From.GetHerHis] attempts to prevent me from doing just that. Clearly, I am the better warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2796;You truly are a poor teacher!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2797;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood does not go the way I had intended for it to go. Though I manage to hold [From.GetHerHim] off for a while and come close to wounding [From.GetHerHim] [From.GetSheHe] eventually gains the upper hand and manages to wound me. It seems like it was a bad idea to issue the challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2797;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2798;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood goes quite well, all things considered. Though it takes a while before it is decided I manage to block all of [From.GetHerHis] attacks before they can draw blood and eventually manage to get past [From.GetHerHis] defenses to wound [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2798;You deserve no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2799;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood goes about as well as I had planned. [From.GetSheHeCap] makes a few feeble attempts to wound me that I easily deal with, and I quickly manage to inflict a grievious wound on [From.GetHerHim] as [From.GetHerHis] ability to defend [From.GetHerselfHimself] clearly is lacking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2799;You truly are a poor student!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2800;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood does not go the way I had hoped. In fact, it goes about as poorly as it could go, short of my mentor killing me. [From.GetSheHeCap] easily avoids my sword and quickly wonds me in a major way. It seems like it was a bad idea to accept the challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2800;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2801;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood goes quite well, all things considered. Though it takes a while before it is decided I manage to block all of [From.GetHerHis] attacks before they can draw blood and eventually manage to get past [From.GetHerHis] defenses to wound [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2801;You deserve no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2802;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood does not go the way I had intended for it to go. Though I manage to hold [From.GetHerHim] off for a while and come close to wounding [From.GetHerHim] [From.GetSheHe] eventually gains the upper hand and manages to wound me. It seems like it was a bad idea to accept the challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2802;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2803;While [From.GetBestName] is a promising student [From.GetSheHe] still has quite far to go before [From.GetSheHe] is worthy to progress any further as a Warrior of the Rising Sun. However, from the way [From.GetSheHe] has been acting it seems as if [From.GetSheHe] thinks otherwise, and telling [From.GetHerHim] otherwise might upset [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2803;I suppose I could lower the bar...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2803;[From.GetSheHeCap] is not ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2804;[From.GetBestName] summons me for what I expect to be routine training session even though I have started to believe that [From.GetSheHe] cannot teach me anything more at this point. However, to my great pleasure, [From.GetSheHe] instead declares that my training is at an end as I have proven myself a skilled warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2804;I knew I was ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2805;[From.GetBestName] summons me one day and tells me that even though I might think that I have all but reached the point where I have proven proven myself worthy of being a full Warrior of the Rising Sun my training is not yet complete. [From.GetSheHeCap] implies that I will not be done for quite some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2805;I suppose you know best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2805;I am ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2806;It seems [From.GetBestName] has become convinced that I am intentionally holding [From.GetHerHim] back. Though this certainly is not the case, my attempt to convince [From.GetHerHim] otherwise only ends up making things worse. It soon becomes quite clear that [From.GetSheHe] now views me as an enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2806;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2807;[From.GetBestName] is a most promising student, and as far as I can tell [From.GetSheHe] is skilled enough that nobody would fault me for declaring [From.GetHerHis] training over. I could of course also delay it, in case I do not wish for [From.GetBestName] to advance further in the ranks of the Warriors of the Rising Sun, even though that would be dishonorable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2807;[From.GetSheHeCap] is ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2807;I think I will delay this a bit...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2808;[From.GetBestName] summons me for what I expect to be routine training session even though I have started to believe that [From.GetSheHe] cannot teach me anything more at this point. However, to my great pleasure, [From.GetSheHe] instead declares that my training is at an end as I have proven myself a skilled warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2808;I knew I was ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2809;[From.GetBestName] summons me one day and tells me that even though I might think that I have all but reached the point where I have proven proven myself worthy of being a full Warrior of the Rising Sun my training is not yet complete. [From.GetSheHeCap] implies that I will not be done for quite some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2809;I suppose you know best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2809;I am ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2810;It seems [From.GetBestName] has become convinced that I am intentionally holding [From.GetHerHim] back. This is of course the case, and my attempt to lie to [From.GetHerHim] about this only ends up making things worse. It soon becomes quite clear that [From.GetSheHe] now views me as an enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2810;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2811;My student, [From.GetBestName], apparently thinks that [From.GetSheHe] is being held back even though I are not holding [From.GetHerHim] back, as [From.GetSheHe] has told me as much to your face. Clearly, I will need to tell [From.GetHerHim] the truth, and I will need to do so in a convincing fashion to avoid turning [From.GetHerHim] into an enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2811;You truly are not ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2812;For a while now I have been suspecting that my mentor, [From.GetBestName], has been holding me back and that I perhaps already had proven that I am worthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun. However, when I confronted [From.GetBestName] about it [From.GetSheHe] quickly managed to convince me otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2812;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2813;For a while now I have been suspecting that my mentor, [From.GetBestName], has been holding me back and that I perhaps already had proven that I am worthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun. When I confronted [From.GetBestName] about it [From.GetHerHis] response was highly suspect, and I doubt [From.GetSheHe]was telling the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2813;You lie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2814;My attempt to convince [From.GetBestName] that [From.GetSheHe] is in need of further training did not go as intended, as [From.GetSheHe] took what I said as confirmation that I have been holding [From.GetHerHim] back even though that is not the truth. As a consequence of this [From.GetBestName] now seems to view me as an enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2814;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2815;[From.GetBestName]'s training has now reached the point where it would be pointless to continue it any further as [From.GetSheHe] definitely is worthy of being a full Warrior of the Rising Sun. It it time to inform [From.GetHerHim] of the good news, and perhaps also time to look for another student if there is anyone else in need of a mentor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2815;I can teach you no more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2816;[From.GetBestName] summons me for what I expect to be routine training session even though I have started to believe that [From.GetSheHe] cannot teach me anything more at this point. However, to my great pleasure, [From.GetSheHe] instead declares that my training is at an end as I have proven myself a skilled warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2816;I knew I was ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2817;I and [From.GetBestName] are both students of [FromFrom.GetBestName], and we have sometimes had shared lessons together with our mentor. As a result we have gotten to know each other quite well, and I feel certain that I would be able to count on [From.GetBestName] as a friend and ally if I ever need [From.GetHerHis] assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2817;Together we will be unstoppable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2818;I and [From.GetBestName] are both students of [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], and we have sometimes had shared lessons together with our mentor. As a result we have gotten to know each other quite well, and I feel certain that I would be able to count on [From.GetBestName] as a friend and ally if I ever need [From.GetHerHis] assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2818;Together we will be unstoppable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2819;I have spent quite a bit of time in the company of [From.GetBestName] due to our shared mentor. I have always felt that [From.GetSheHe] is rather attractive, and I have enjoyed [From.GetHerHis] company quite a bit, and perhaps we could have a rather more intimate relationship, if that is something that would appeal to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2819;I should approach [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2819;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2820;I have spent quite a bit of time in the company of [From.GetBestName] as the two of us share a mentor. I have always found [From.GetHerHis] company quite enjoyable, and [From.GetSheHe] is rather good attractive, too. One day [From.GetBestName] suggests that perhaps the two of us should get to know each other rather more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2820;I like the way you think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2820;What? No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2821;[From.GetBestName] turns out to be quite interested in me as well, and it does not take the two of us long to find somewhere private to get to know each other rather more intimately. Though we probably should be discreet about our relationship going forward, it will certainly make our shared lessons even more enjoyable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2821;I knew this would end well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2822;Though [From.GetBestName] is quite courteous it is clear that [From.GetSheHe] is not at all interested in the idea of getting to know me more intimately. While it hopefully will not result in things between the us becoming strained, it certainly was not what I was hoping for when I choose to approach [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2822;Well, that went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2823;I share a mentor with [From.GetBestName] in [FromFrom.GetBestName], and this has resulted in the three of us having several lessons together. Though I initially had hoped that I would get along with my fellow student it has become rather clear to me that that is not going to happen since [From.GetBestName] is highly competitive and clearly sees me as a rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2823;You will never be my equal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2824;I share a mentor with [From.GetBestName] in [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], and this has resulted in the three of us having several lessons together. Though I initially had hoped that I would get along with my fellow student it has become rather clear to me that that is not going to happen since [From.GetBestName] is highly competitive and clearly sees me as a rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2824;You will never be my equal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2825;As I and [From.GetBestName] both are trying to prove our worth to [FromFrom.GetBestName] we have sometimes gotten together to spar with one another between our official lessons since that might help us advance more quickly. We have recently spent a bit more time doing this than before, and as far as I can tell it is starting to yield some results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2825;We have both learned a few things;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2826;As I and [From.GetBestName] both are trying to prove our worth to [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] we have sometimes gotten together to spar with one another between our official lessons since that might help us advance more quickly. We have recently spent a bit more time doing this than before, and as far as I can tell it is starting to yield some results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2826;We have both learned a few things;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2827;I have spent some time around [From.GetBestName] as the two of us share a mentor in [FromFrom.GetBestName], and in my opinion [From.GetSheHe] has always been acting a bit dishonestly. Today I found irrefutable proof that [From.GetSheHe] has been lying, which probably is information that [FromFrom.GetBestName] would be quite interested in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2827;I should confront [From.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2827;I will let this slide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2828;It seems [From.GetBestName] has managed to discover proof that I have not been completely honest at all times recently, as [From.GetSheHe] has confronted me with this information and is indicating that [From.GetSheHe] might tell [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] about it. It is possible that a bribe might be able to buy [From.GetBestName]'s silence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2828;How about some money?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2828;How about a Favor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2828;I'm calling in my Favor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_2828;Do your worst!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2829;[From.GetBestName] was evidently interested in securing my silence when I confronted [From.GetHerHim] about [From.GetHerHis] dishonesty, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] immediately offered to pay me quite a bit of money to make me forget about the matter. It would be dishonorable to accept a bribe, of course, but surely nobody would ever know...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2829;We have a deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2829;I will not be bribed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2830;[From.GetBestName] was evidently interested in securing my silence when I confronted [From.GetHerHim] about [From.GetHerHis] dishonesty, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] immediately offered to grant me a Favor to make me forget about the matter. It would be a bit dishonorable to accept a bribe, but surely nobody would ever know...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2830;We have a deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2830;I will not be bribed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2831;I would have thought that the offer of a bribe would have convinced [From.GetBestName] to drop the matter of my occasional lie to our shared mentor, but evidently [From.GetSheHe] is a bit too honorable for that to be the case. [From.GetSheHeCap] laughed at my offer before leaving to speak with our mentor about what [From.GetSheHe] had discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2831;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2832;It seems [From.GetBestName] has come across evidence that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been lying to me. Though it is possible that this evidence could have been fabricated I know that [FromFrom.GetBestName] usually is less trustworthy than [From.GetBestName], so this accusation is likely true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2832;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2833;[From.GetBestName] was evidently interested in securing my silence when I confronted [From.GetHerHim] about [From.GetHerHis] dishonesty, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] immediately called in the Favor that I owed [From.GetHerHim]. As it would not do to fail to honor the Favor I have no choice but to remain silent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2833;I suppose that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2834;I would have thought that [From.GetBestName] would offer me some kind of bribe in exchange for my silence on the matter of [From.GetHerHis] dishonesty, but [From.GetSheHe] laughed in mu face and told me to do your worst, stating that [From.GetSheHe] has nothing to fear from any accusations I might make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2834;As you wish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2835;It seems [From.GetBestName] has come across evidence that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been lying to me. Though it is possible that this evidence could have been fabricated I know that [FromFrom.GetBestName] usually is less trustworthy than [From.GetBestName], so this accusation is likely true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2835;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2836;I and [From.GetBestName] have a shared mentor in [FromFrom.GetBestName], and we have been given all manner of lessons together. Now both of us have been tasked with reading about warfare in the Art of War and similar books, and we would definitely learn faster working together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2836;Let's study together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2837;I and [From.GetBestName] have a shared mentor in [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], and we have been given all manner of lessons together. Now both of us have been tasked with reading about warfare in the Art of War and similar books, and we would definitely learn faster working together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2837;Let's study together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2838;My rival, [From.GetBestName], and I have the same mentor, [FromFrom.GetBestName]. I have long hoped that my mentor would have dismissed such a worthless student, but it has not happened yet. Perhaps I could change that if I proved that [From.GetBestName] truly is a terrible warrior by wounding [From.GetHerHim] in a duel... preferably severely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2838;I'll issue a challenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2838;I have better things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2839;I and [From.GetBestName] do not exactly see eye-to-eye, and I suspect that both of us would like nothing more than to be rid of each other. [From.GetSheHeCap] has now suggested a practice duel to first blood, and though it would be unwise to try to kill [From.GetHerHim] I could try to harm [From.GetHerHim] quite a bit in such a duel...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2839;Challenge accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2839;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2840;It seems my rival, [From.GetBestName], has no interest in my proposed duel. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] saw through my plan to try to injure [From.GetHerHim] severely and elected not to take the risk, but it is also possible [From.GetSheHe] is just a coward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2840;I think it is cowardice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2841;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood does not go the way I had intended for it to go. In fact, it goes about as poorly as it could go, short of my student killing me. [From.GetSheHeCap] easily avoids my attacks and quickly injures me in a major way. If the duel had not been to first blood, [From.GetSheHe] could easily have killed me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2841;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2842;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood goes about as well as I had hoped. [From.GetSheHeCap] makes a few feeble attempts to wound me that I easily avoid, and I quickly manage to inflict a grievious wound on [From.GetHerHim] despite [From.GetHerHis] attempts to prevent me from doing just that. Clearly, I am the better warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2842;You truly are a poor warrior!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2843;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood does not go the way I had intended for it to go. Though I manage to hold [From.GetHerHim] off for a while and come close to wounding [From.GetHerHim] [From.GetSheHe] eventually gains the upper hand and manages to wound me. It seems like it was a bad idea to issue the challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2843;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2844;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood goes quite well, all things considered. Though it takes a while before it is decided I manage to block all of [From.GetHerHis] attacks before they can draw blood and eventually manage to get past [From.GetHerHis] defenses to wound [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2844;You deserve no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2845;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood goes about as well as I had planned. [From.GetSheHeCap] makes a few feeble attempts to wound me that I easily deal with, and I quickly manage to inflict a grievious wound on [From.GetHerHim] as [From.GetHerHis] ability to defend [From.GetHerselfHimself] clearly is lacking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2845;You truly are a poor warrior!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2846;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood does not go the way I had hoped. In fact, it goes about as poorly as it could go, short of my mentor killing me. [From.GetSheHeCap] easily avoids my sword and quickly wonds me in a major way. It seems like it was a bad idea to accept the challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2846;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2847;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood goes quite well, all things considered.

It seems like it was a bad idea to accept the challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2848;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2849;I have known that [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have considered one another rivals for some time even though I have done my best to try to smooth things over. Now it seems that the two of them have fought a duel against one another, and that one of them has walked away from it in rather bad shape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2849;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2850;I and [From.GetBestName] share a mentor in [FromFrom.GetBestName], and though she seems to be respected by my mentor I are not quite sure she deserves that respect as I have heard many Warriors of the Rising Sun say that women should not be fighting except in truly dire circumstances. Perhaps they are right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2850;She will never be a proper warrior!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2850;I suppose she could have what it takes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2851;I have faced a good amount of prejudice among the Warriors of the Rising Sun as quite a few of them seem to be of the opinion that I will end up disappointing everyone, seemingly for no reason other than that I am a woman. It seems my fellow student, [From.GetBestName], shares this sentiment, as he has told me as much to my face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2851;I can ignore this insult...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2851;It is you who will be the disappointment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2852;It seems [From.GetBestName] did not like being called out on being a poor warrior by virtue of being a woman. She angrily told me that she will not only prove herself worthy of being one of the Warriors of the Rising Sun but also will prove to everyone that she always will be my better, and that I will rue the day I made an enemy of her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2852;An empty threat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2853;I and [From.GetBestName] are both women and have both faced quite a bit of prejudice from other Warriors of the Rising Sun as a result as many of them do not seem to grasp the fact that a woman can be just as good a warrior as a man can be. This has brought us closer to each other, and I would say that we likely will be friends for life..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2853;We shall stand together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2854;I and [From.GetBestName] are both women and have both faced quite a bit of prejudice from other Warriors of the Rising Sun as a result as many of them do not seem to grasp the fact that a woman can be just as good a warrior as a man can be. This has brought us closer to each other, and I would say that we likely will be friends for life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2854;We shall stand together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2855;One of my friends, [FromFrom.GetBestName], is currently mentoring [From.GetBestName] in the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun. I have had a good number of interactions with the two of them recently, and I have discovered that I and [From.GetBestName] have quite a few things in common and feel that the two of us likely will be friends for life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2855;We shall stand together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2856;[From.GetBestName], a friend of my mentor, [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], and we have spent some time together recently due to your shared obligations as Warriors of the Rising Sun. I have gotten to know [From.GetHerHim] quite well as a result and definitely enjoy [From.GetHerHis] company, and it seems like [From.GetSheHe] also enjoys my company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2856;I have made a friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2857;I have spent some time in the companty of {FromFrom.GetBestName] and [From.GetBestName] recently, and it seems as if the two of them are getting along quite well. As [FromFrom.GetBestName] is a close friend of mine this is likely going to be beneficial for my student in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2857;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2858;Though there are members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun that are quite worthy of the honor of being part of the society there are also members that really are unworthy of membership, such as my rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], and [FromFrom.GetHerHis] student, [From.GetBestName], a truly unpleasant [From.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2858;They are both my enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2859;My mentor, [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], has made no secret of the fact that [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] and [From.GetBestName] dislike one another, and while I have been trying to keep an open mind I have realized that [From.GetBestName] clearly does not respect me and sees me as an enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2859;I must oppose [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2860;I have spoken at length about the dishonorable cretin that is [FromFrom.GetBestName] to my student, [From.GetBestName], and at times it has seemed as if my words have fallen on deaf ears. However, as of today I have learned that my student has come to agree with me about my hated rival, and that [From.GetSheHe] seeks to oppose [FromFrom.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2860;Good! Good! Destroy [FromFrom.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2861;My hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], is currently mentoring [From.GetBestName], and from what I have heard [From.GetSheHe] is rather promising student. Though some would view it as dishonorable, maybe I should try to convince [From.GetBestName] to become my student instead, as it would humiliate my rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2861;I should approach [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2861;It's not worth it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2863;One day when I am on the way to meet with my mentor, [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], I am approached by [From.GetBestName], my mentor's rival. [From.GetSheHeCap] suggests that my potential is being squandered by my mentor and suggests that [From.GetSheHe] would be a better mentor. Even if it is a dishonorable offer, perhaps it is worth accepting?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2863;I pledge myself to you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2863;I will never be your student!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2864;I make my offer to [From.GetBestName] and am quite pleased to discover that [From.GetSheHe] is open to the suggestion that I should take over as [From.GetHerHis] mentor. It brings me even more satisfaction to be present when my new student informs [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName] that [From.GetSheHe] now will be taking lessons from me instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2864;Just as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2865;My student, [From.GetBestName], arrives slightly later than expected to our lesson, and to my surprise my hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], arrives along with [From.GetHerHim]. I quickly discover that my rival has convinced my student that [From.GetSheHe] would be better off being mentored by [FromFrom.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2865;You both lack honor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2866;I expected [From.GetBestName] to at least give the suggestion that I should become [From.GetHerHis] mentor instead of [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName] some consideration before making up [From.GetHerHis] mind, but [From.GetSheHe] immediately informed me that [From.GetSheHe] was not going to abandon [From.GetHerHis] current mentor in no uncertain terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2866;What a disappointment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2867;My student, [From.GetBestName], arrives slightly later than expected to our lesson. [From.GetSheHeCap] informs me that [FromFrom.GetBestName], my hated rival, apparently demanded to speak to [From.GetHerHim] and suggested that [From.GetSheHe] should become [FromFrom.GetHerHis] student instead, but that [From.GetSheHe] refused this dishonorable suggestion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2867;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2868;Among the many Novices seeking to prove themselves worthy of progressing further in the Warriors of the Rising Sun is [From.GetBestName], who clearly shows promise. One day the two of us meet by pure chance, and I see an opportunity to give [From.GetBestName] some quick advice to help [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2868;Here's a quick tip!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2869;I have occasionally come across other members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun than my mentor during my training, and though some of them have seen fit to largely ignore me others have been rather helpful. One of the more helpful people I have met is [From.GetBestName], who recently gave me some good advice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2869;[From.GetSheHeCap] certainly helped me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2870;I have met a good number of Warriors of the Rising Sun over the years, and many of them have been quite dismissive towards me because I am a woman. Doubtlessly, this is something that [From.GetBestName] also will encounter over the years to come, and she would probably have an easier time if she got some help from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2870;I'll give her some advice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2871;[From.GetBestName] approaches me one day to express her appreciation of the fact that I have joined the Warriors of the Rising Sun despite the fact that many of the men in the society are of the opinion that women should not be members. She offers me a few quick tips as to how I could deal with the situation and how I could prove myself worthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2871;My thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2872;[FromFrom.GetBestName] and I have both faced prejudice because we are women and many Warriors of the Rising Sun find it hard to accept that we are skilled warriors. Doubtlessly, this is something that [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s student, [From.GetBestName], will have to deal with as well, and she woud probably have an easier time if she got a few tips.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2872;I'll give her some advice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2873;[From.GetBestName] approaches me one day to express her appreciation of the fact that I have joined the Warriors of the Rising Sun despite the fact that many of the men in the society are of the opinion that women should not be members. She offers me a few quick tips as to how I could deal with the situation and how I could prove myself worthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2873;My thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2874;My mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are bitter rivals, and the two of them always seek to prove that the other lacks honor. Now it seems that [From.GetBestName] dislikes me, perhaps because of [From.GetHerHis] mentor's influence, and [From.GetSheHe] seems determined to prove that I am unworthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2874;It is you who are unworthy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2875;My mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are bitter rivals, and the two of them always seek to prove that the other lacks honor. Now it seems that [From.GetBestName] dislikes me, perhaps because of [From.GetHerHis] mentor's influence, and [From.GetSheHe] seems determined to prove that I am unworthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2875;It is you who are unworthy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2876;Though my mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are bitter rivals I and [From.GetBestName] have always gotten along quite well. Though I suspect that our respective mentors would prefer otherwise, the two of us are determined to not get caught up in their dispute and intend to work together in the name of honor and glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2876;We need not be foes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2877;Though my mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are bitter rivals I and [From.GetBestName] have always gotten along quite well. Though I suspect that our respective mentors would prefer otherwise, the two of us are determined to not get caught up in their dispute and intend to work together in the name of honor and glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2877;We need not be foes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2878;Though my mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are bitter rivals I have never had anything against [From.GetBestName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems to thoroughly enjoy my company, and I enjoy [From.GetHerHis] company as well and also find [From.GetHerHim] rather attractive. Maybe we should take our relationship in a more intimate direction...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2878;I should approach [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2878;It's not worth it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2879;One day I am approached by [From.GetBestName], the student of a rival of my mentor. The two of us have always gotten along rather well despite our respective mentors not getting along, and [From.GetSheHe] now suggests that the two of us perhaps should take our relationship in a more intimate direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2879;That sounds lovely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2879;You and me? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2880;[From.GetBestName] is quite receptive to my suggestion that the two of us should begin a more intimate relationship, and the two of us quickly find a location where we can have some privacy. Though our mentors doubtlessly would be quite displeased to discover that the two of us now are lovers hopefully we will be able to avoid discovery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2880;I'm sure it'll be fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2881;When approached on the matter [From.GetBestName] informs me that [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in a more intimate relationship with me. Perhaps it is because our mentors would find it highly disagreeable if they ever found out, or perhaps [From.GetBestName] simply is not interested in intimacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2881;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2882;Though my mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are friends and they presumably would have preferred for me and [From.GetHerHim] to get along there is something infuriating about [From.GetBestName] that makes it impossible for me to stand [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is clearly devoid of honor, and does not deserve my respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2882;[From.GetSheHeCap] will never be my equal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2883;Though my mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are friends and they presumably would have preferred for me and [From.GetHerHim] to get along there is something infuriating about [From.GetBestName] that makes it impossible for me to stand [From.GetHerHim].

EVTOPTA_SOH_2883;[From.GetSheHeCap] will never be my equal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2884;It is no secret that my mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are friends, and the two of us have also been getting along quite well when we have spent time together. Though there might be Warriors of the Rising Sun that are dishonorable and unworthy, [From.GetBestName] is certainly not one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2884;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2885;It is no secret that my mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are friends, and the two of us have also been getting along quite well when we have spent time together. Though there might be Warriors of the Rising Sun that are dishonorable and unworthy, [From.GetBestName] is certainly not one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2885;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2886;Since my mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are close friends it is only natural that the two of us have been spending quite some time in each other's company, and I feel that the two of us are getting along quite well. [From.GetSheHeCap] is also rather attractive, so maybe I should see if [From.GetSheHe] is interested in a more intimate relationship...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2886;It is worth a shot...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2886;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2887;Since my mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are close friends it is only natural that the two of us have been spending quite some time in each other's company, and the two of us have been getting along quite well. It seems like [From.GetSheHe] thinks we should be even closer, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] just propositioned me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2887;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2887;Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2888;[From.GetBestName] is appreciative of my suggestion, and the two of us soon manage to find someplace private to take our relationship to the next level. Though we perhaps should keep our relationship a secret in case others disapprove of it, it will very likely make future meetings between the two of us even more pleasant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2888;This is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2889;Thouhg [From.GetBestName] is quite courteous in the way [From.GetSheHe] goes about the matter [From.GetSheHe] still firmly turns down mu suggestion that the two of us should consider a more intimate relationship. Perhaps it is for the best, seeing as there might be those that would disapprove of such a relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2889;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2890;I have spoken with other Novices in the Warriors of the Rising Sun from time to time during ,y training to see what they were being taught, occasionally getting small tips from them as to how I could improve more quickly. I have also been able to give advice at times, such as when I came across [From.GetBestName] today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2890;Here's a quick tip!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2891;It is not uncommon for ,e to speak with other Novices seeking to prove themselves true Warriors of the Rising Sun from time to time to exchange small bits of advice that might be helpful. Recently I got a bit of advice from [From.GetBestName] that I think will be quite helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2891;That was helpful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2892;There has always been a small number of women among the Warriors of the Rising Sun, and some of them have been anything but worthy of that honor. I have recently considered [From.GetBestName]'s suitability, wondering if she is someone that deserves to be a Warrior of the Rising Sun. If not, I should probably let her know that she is unworthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2892;She is unworthy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2892;She could have what it takes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2893;It seems that [From.GetBestName] is one of the members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun that is unwilling to accept the fact that a woman could pick up a weapon and wield it just as well as a man as he has told me as much to my face. Maybe he phrased it poorly, or maybe he meant for it to be as insulting as it sounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2893;I'm probably overreacting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2893;I am more worthy than he is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2894;[From.GetBestName] did not take me informing her that she might be unfit to be a Warrior of the Rising Sun well, which perhaps was not all that suprising, and she angrily proclaimed that she was far more worthy of that honor than I ever will be and that I one day will rue the day that I made an enemy of her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2894;She's clearly in denial!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2895;Even though I have not been a member of the Warriors of the Rising Sun for a very long time I have encountered quite a few men who have told me that they do not think I should be a warrior. Doubtlessly [From.GetBestName] has experienced similar prejudice, and she could probably use a friend as much as I could.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2895;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
