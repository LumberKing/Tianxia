EVTDESC_SOH_2617;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nA true warrior is a skilled commander, and there is no better way for you to prove that you are indeed a skilled commander than to win a War of Honor against [war_target.GetBestName].\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2620A;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt pleases me that you have defeated your foe in a War of Honor in accordance with the desires of the Warriors of the Rising Sun.

EVTDESC_SOH_2620B;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt pleases me that you have defeated your hated rival in a War of Honor in accordance with the desires of the Warriors of the Rising Sun.

EVTDESC_SOH_2623A;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt displeases me and all other Warriors of the Rising Sun that you have failed to defeat your foe in a War of Honor.

EVTDESC_SOH_2623B;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt displeases me and all other Warriors of the Rising Sun that you have failed to defeat your hated rival in a War of Honor. It would seem it is not their honor that is lacking...\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2623;I have brought dishonor on myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2625;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt is well known that you and [war_target.GetBestName] are rivals, and we have all heard that you consider them dishonorable. Prove that you are the honorable party by defeating [war_target.GetHerHim] in a War of Honor.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2627;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nWhile engaging in glorious battle on the battlefield certainly is honorable there are times when a warrior needs to look to the defense of their lands and people, and it would be a good idea for you to construct a castle to make this more manageable.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2630;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI have just received word that you have finished the construction of a new castle as requested. Keep it well maintained and garrisoned with loyal soldiers, and it shall serve you well.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2630;Of course I will do that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2632;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt is disappointing that your current focus in life is somewhat less honorable than it should be. To remedy this problem, I suggest that you immediately switch to the War Focus.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2633;In accordance with the desires of the Warriors of the Rising Sun I have decided to dedicate myself to warfare for the time being by switching to the War Focus. Hopefully, this will result in some benefits other than just the respect of my peers, even if such respect certainly would not be undesirable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2633;I have a good feeling about this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2635;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYou are a great warrior, possibly one of the best in the Warriors of the Rising Sun, but there are skilled warriors elsewhere in the world too.

not_the_very_best;You will §Rnever§! be allowed to prove yourself the Very Best in the future;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2637;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nThe way in which you are governing your lands is less suitable for a warrior than it could be. A more feudal system would be more appropriate, and you should consider making the appropriate changes.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2640;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI have been informed that you now are governing your lands in a fashion befitting a true warrior. I trust you will find this to be beneficial in the future.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2640;I have a good feeling about this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2701;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI write to you to request that you become my mentor so that I may learn the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun and prove myself worthy so that I one day may ascend to a higher rank.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[FromFrom.GetSocietyRank] [FromFrom.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2701;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2701;Prove that you're good enough to be my student first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2701;I will do it, if you pay me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_2701;I will do it... for a Favor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_2701;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2702;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt would be a pleasure to mentor you in the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun. I will begin preparing a lesson plan right away.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2702;Sounds good to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2703;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI might be prepared to mentor you in the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun as you ask, but first you will have to show me that you have what it takes to be my student.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2703;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2703;I have nothing to prove to you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2704;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI am a busy [From.GetManWoman] and am uncertain as to whether I would be able to find the time to mentor you. However, in exchange for a small sum of gold I believe I can find the time...\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2704;I suppose that's fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2704;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2705;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI can see why you would want me to mentor you in the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun, and I might be willing to do you that favor, but in that case I would ask a favor in return at a later date...\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2705;I think that's reasonable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2705;Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2706;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYou may have been allowed to join the ranks of the Warriors of the Rising Sun, but that is not sufficient reason for me to teach you. You will have to find someone else to teach you!\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2706;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2707;[From.GetBestName] arrives without delay and eagerly shows me what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of as a warrior. In my experience, new members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun are generally somewhat lacking in skill regardless of their background, but [From.GetBestName] is possibly more skilled than I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2707;I should suggest an even better mentor...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2707;I can probably give [From.GetHerHim] a few tips...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2707;I don't really think I want to teach [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2708;[From.GetBestName] arrives without delay and eagerly shows me what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of as a warrior. While I notice some areas where [From.GetSheHe] might be lacking, [From.GetSheHe] does quite well, and it is clear that those that have given [From.GetBestName] lessons in the past left little for me to help [From.GetHerHim] improve on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2708;I will take [From.GetHerHim] on as a student!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2708;I think this would be a waste of my time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2709;[From.GetBestName] arrives without delay and eagerly shows me what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of as a warrior. I notice some flaws, but also some strengths, and in my opinion [From.GetBestName] is about as skilled as the average new member of the Warriors of the Rising Sun tends to be. I could certainly help [From.GetHerHim] improve a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2709;[From.GetSheHeCap] would be a good student for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2709;I would rather not teach [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2710;[From.GetBestName] arrives without delay and eagerly shows me what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of as a warrior. I notice a few promising areas, but on the whole [From.GetSheHe] is a rather poor warrior, and it would likely take quite some work to help [From.GetHerHim] improve to the point where [From.GetSheHe] would perform adequately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2710;I'm willing to teach [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2710;Teaching [From.GetHerHim] would be too much work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2711;[From.GetBestName] arrives without delay and eagerly shows me what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of as a warrior. To call [From.GetHerHis] performance "bad" would be charitable, to say the least, and it would doubtlessly be a major undertaking to make [From.GetHerHim] perform at even the lowest level I would deem acceptable for a Warrior of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2711;I do like a challenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2711;[From.GetSheHeCap] is not worth my time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2712;Despite giving [From.GetBestName] a fair opportunity to prove [From.GetHerselfHimself] worthy of being my student, which certainly was not out of order, [From.GetSheHe] does not agree to show me what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of. It seems [From.GetSheHe] was under the impression that all [From.GetSheHe] had to do was ask.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2712;In that case, I must refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2713;It seems I have impressed [From.GetBestName] with my skills as [From.GetSheHe] informs me that [From.GetSheHe] is uncertain [From.GetSheHe] could teach me much. [From.GetSheHeCap] thinks that [better_mentor.GetBestName] might be a better mentor, and has offered to ask [better_mentor.GetHerHim] to become my mentor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2713;Sounds like a plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2713;No, I want you to teach me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2714;Though I had expected [From.GetBestName] to accept my offer to try to get [better_mentor.GetBestName] to teach [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetBestName] surprises me by demanding that I mentor [From.GetHerHim] personally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2714;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2714;I don't think that'd be good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2715;While my request seems to have taken [From.GetBestName] by surprise it evidently was a good idea to ask as [From.GetSheHe] has agreed to take me on despite [From.GetHerHis] initial reservations. Perhaps I will not learn as much as I might have been able to learn with another mentor, but I might also be able to prove myself more quickly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2715;I'm sure this will be good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2716;It seems I displeased [From.GetBestName] by insisting that [From.GetSheHe] should mentor me personally as [From.GetSheHe] has refused to entertain the notion and has rescinded [From.GetHerHis] previous offer to help me get another mentor. It seems I will have to approach someone else in person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2716;That was unexpected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2717;A messenger has arrived from [FromFrom.GetBestName], bearing a message telling me that [From.GetBestName] is an exceptionally gifted warrior and that it might be a good idea for me to mentor [From.GetHerHim] as [FromFrom.GetBestName] is uncertain whether [FromFrom.GetSheHe] could teach [From.GetBestName] much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2717;I would be happy to teach them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2717;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2718;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI hereby inform you that I have seen fit to accept you as my student, as requested by [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]. I hope that this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2718;I look forward to learning from you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2719;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI hereby inform you that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has accepted me as [FromFrom.GetHerHis] student. I thank you for your help in arranging for it to happen.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2719;It was my pleasure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2720;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nWhile [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] speaks highly of you I do not think it would be in my interest to mentor you as [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] has requested.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2720;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2721;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nDespite your letter to [FromFrom.GetBestName] [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has refused to mentor me. I ask that you reconsider mentoring me, as I initially requested.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2721;I suppose I can do it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2721;I don't think that would be a good idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2722;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIf [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] is unwilling to mentor you then I am prepared to do so. You certainly deserve an opportunity to prove yourself.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2722;I'm glad to hear that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2723;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI am surprised that [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] is unwilling to mentor you. However, though I understand your desire to get a mentor, I am not prepared to mentor you personally at this time.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2723;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2724;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYou have performed quite well, and I would definitely be willing to mentor you so that you may learn a few minor things that would be good for you to know.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2724;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2725;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYour performance was not particularly impressive, but I am still willing to mentor you so that you may become truly worthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2725;Well, that's fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2726;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nWhile your performance was decent enough I must say that I would rather not mentor you. You will have to find someone else to take you on.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2726;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2727;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYour performance was not particularly impressive, and I therefore have no interest in mentoring you. I wish you better luck elsewhere.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2727;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2728;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nWhile I am surprised to learn that you would go as far as to demand money in exchange for mentoring me, I think it is an acceptable trade.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2728;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2729;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI think it is quite dishonorable of you to demand money in exchange for mentoring met. I will look elsewhere for a mentor.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2729;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2730;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nWhile I am surprised to learn that you would go as far as to demand a Favor in exchange for mentoring me I believe I can accept such an agreement.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2730;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2731;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI think it is quite dishonorable of you to demand a Favor in exchange for mentoring me, and I have no interest in any such arrangement. I will look elsewhere for a mentor.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2731;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2733A;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI am quite happy to know that we now share a mentor in [FromFrom.GetBestName] and look forward to having an opportunity to spend more time together.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2733B;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n[FromFrom.GetBestName] has seen fit to mentor me as I seek to prove myself a worthy Warrior of the Rising Sun. I hope we can be friends, or that we at the very least will not become rivals.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2733C;[Root.GetBestName],\n[FromFrom.GetBestName] will be mentoring me from now on, and I look forward to proving that I am better than you in every way and that you are unfit to be a Warrior of the Rising Sun.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2733;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2733;I sure hope so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2733;You are a fool to oppose me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2734A;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI am quite happy to hear that we now share a mentor in [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] and look forward to spending more time together.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2734B;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI have been told that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has seen fit to mentor you as well. I hope we will get along, and currently see no reason why that should not be possible.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2734C;[Root.GetBestName],\nI hear [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] will be mentoring you. I thank you for giving me the opportunity to prove that I am better than you in every way and that you are unfit to be a Warrior of the Rising Sun.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2734;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2734;I agree with that sentiment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2734;Oh, I look forward to proving the opposite!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2735;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt has come to my attention that you do not yet have a mentor, and I humbly offer to mentor you so that you may advance further in the ranks of the Warriors of the Rising Sun.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[FromFrom.GetSocietyRank] [FromFrom.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2735;That sounds like an excellent idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2735;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2736;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYour offer to mentor me is most definitely welcome, and I see no reason not to accept. I hope that this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2736;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2737;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYour offer to mentor me is very kind, but I think that another mentor would be better for me. I must refuse your offer.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2737;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2741;I am expected to teach [From.GetBestName] how to use a variety of weapons more skillfully while mentoring [From.GetHerHim]. One of those weapons is the sword, which many would consider the most important weapon in the arsenal of any warrior. I should perhaps give [From.GetHerHim] another swordfighting lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2741;"The sword is an elegant weapon...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2741;I have better things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2742;[From.GetBestName], has seen fit to plan a swordfighting lesson for me, stating that it is something that [From.GetSheHe] thinks is a mandatory part of the training that every Warrior of the Rising Sun must undergo and further informing you that the sword is an elegant weapon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2742;"... for a civilized age!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2742;I think I have better things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2743;While other, less civilized, cultures might think that the bow is a weapon that a noble only should use when hunting, the Warriors of the Rising Sun have other opinions on the matter. It would probably not be amiss to spend some time working on [From.GetBestName]'s marksmanship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2743;I should give [From.GetHerHim] a lesson!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2743;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2744;[From.GetBestName], has announced that [From.GetSheHe] think it would be wise for the two of us to dedicate some time towards working on my skill with the bow, stating that it is good for every warrior to be a skilled archer even though there are those that are not Warriors of the Rising Sun that would disagree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2744;An archery lesson sounds good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2744;I can think of things I'd rather do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2745;Though the sword obviously is the weapon that a true Warrior of the Rising Sun should prefer in melee combat there are situations where a spear is more useful, and it would probably be amiss not to give [From.GetBestName] a lesson in how to handle that weapon in case [From.GetSheHe] should need it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2745;I can give a few tips...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2745;Let's not bother with this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2746;Though [From.GetBestName] has told me that the sword is supposed to be my main weapon in melee combat [From.GetSheHe] has also suggested that there are situations where it might be a good idea to use something else, and now [From.GetSheHe] is suggesting that we should spend some time training with a spear since that can be a particularly useful alternative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2746;Sounds good to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2746;I'd rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2747;Though it would not be amiss to spend some time giving [From.GetBestName] a lesson in how to fight on horseback, it would probably also be a good idea to spend some time just working on basic horsemanship as there are those that end up neglecting that to their detriment because they focus too much on mounted combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2747;Saddle my horse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2747;Maybe later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2748;My mentor, [From.GetBestName], suprises me one day by announcing that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that we should spend the day riding and that the day's activities should not involve the use any weapons. Perhaps there is wisdom in that suggestion, as fighting is unlikely to be the only thing I will do from horseback.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2748;Saddle my horse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2748;Maybe later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2749;I have heard that various less civilized cultures look down on a [Root.GetManWoman] using a bow from horseback on the battlefield instead of solely fighting in melee during mounted combat, but I know that the Warriors of the Rising Sun do not share that belief. Perhaps it is time to instruct [From.GetBestName] in mounted archery?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2749;That will be today's lesson!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2749;I don't want to do this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2750;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] intends to focus on mounted archery during our next lesson, stating that it is a perfectly valid approach to combat despite what some foreign barbarians might think. I am of course familiar with using a bow from horseback, but perhaps it would still be a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2750;Sounds good to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2750;No thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2751;The sword is a useful weapon, and is generally what one would expect a warrior to use when fighting a duel on foot or in many other combat circumstances. However, it is also a weapon that can be used on horseback, and it might be a good idea to have a lesson on the subject as part of [From.GetBestName]'s training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2751;It is certainly worthwhile!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2751;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2752;[From.GetBestName] has instructed me to ready my horse and to bring my sword, stating that our next lesson will be on the subject of mounted swordsmanship. Even though I know that the Warriors of the Rising Sun think that fighting on foot when using a sword is the most honorable approach to combat this lesson might still be useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2752;Great idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2752;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2753;Using a spear on horseback is a bit different from using one on foot. It might be valuable to spend some time working on the mounted approach while mentoring [From.GetBestName] as there are sadly warriors who neglect it in favor of other approaches to combat even when those would be actively detrimental.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2753;Time to saddle up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2753;It would be a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2754;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] intends to give me a lesson in how to use a spear in mounted combat. While I already have some idea of how that works it would perhaps not be amiss to spend some time working on it even so as [From.GetBestName] perhaps knows some things I have not heard before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2754;Fetch me a horse and a spear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2754;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2755;Though a Warrior of the Rising Sun is expected to keep a sword within reach at nearly all times and usually also will be keeping other weapons nearby there might it is still possible that a warrior will find themselves without a weapon to use, and perhaps I should train [From.GetBestName] how to fight in such a situation..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2755;Time to put our weapons aside!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2755;This seems unnecessary...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2756;To me surprise, [From.GetBestName] tells me to put my weapons aside when the day's lesson is about to begin, stating that it would be a good idea for me to learn how to fight in unarmed combat should I end up being separated from my weapons for one reason or another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2756;This might be useful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2756;This does not interest me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2757;A Warrior of the Rising Sun is supposed to be honorable at all times, and there are few things as honorable as ensuring that the law is followed at all times. This is probably not unknown to [From.GetBestName], but as [From.GetHerHis] mentor it might be good for me to ensure that [From.GetSheHe] knows this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2757;That will be today's lesson!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2757;I don't have time for this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2758;My mentor, [From.GetBestName], sets some time aside one day to discuss my opinion on the subject of laws and justice. [From.GetSheHeCap] is quite pleased when [From.GetSheHe] hears that the two of us are in agreement on the subject, stating that there are other Warriors of the Rising Sun that have other, incorrect, opinions on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2758;Justice will be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2759;My mentor, [From.GetBestName], sets some time aside one day to discuss my opinion on the subject of laws and justice. I know that all Warriors of the Rising Sun are supposed to be honorable, and that there are those that think that being honorable and following the law is the same thing, but I had not thought too much about it previously.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2759;Justice must prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2759;Honor sometimes requires breaking the law...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2760;While the Warriors of the Rising Sun are open to having members that are not [Root.Religion.GetName] and on rare occasions have permitted members that have followed quite exotic religions, it is clear that most foreign ways are incompatible with being an honorable warrior. It might be wise to instruct [From.GetBestName] about the dangers of foreign ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2760;Their foreign ways must be avoided!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2760;Let's not be too hasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2761;My mentor, [From.GetBestName], seems to be concerned by the fact that foreign barbarians might have religions that are inherently incompatible with being honorable, as [From.GetSheHe] spends a large part of a day talking about the matter and how it is important for all Warriors of the Rising Sun to not be led astray by those following foreign religions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2761;Their foreign ways must be avoided!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2761;Let's not be too hasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2762;My religion has sometimes been something of a sore point when interacting with other Warriors of the Rising Sun as there are those that think that my religion is too foreign to be something that an honorable warrior could follow. As part of mentoring [From.GetBestName] it might be possible to try to make [From.GetHerHim] more open-minded than most.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2762;This is an opportunity...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2762;This would be a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2763;It is well known that my mentor, [From.GetBestName], follows a religion that is quite unusual for a Warrior of the Rising Sun and there are those that think that this makes [From.GetHerHim] inherently dishonorable. However, [From.GetSheHe] has been trying to teach me that the [From.Religion.GetName] religion is not as dishonorable as people might think.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2763;Well, you seem alright to me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2763;Your religion is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2764;My student, [From.GetBestName], is not a follower of one of the main religions of the Warriors of the Rising Sun, and though there are those that think that foreign religions always are dishonorable I have to admit that [From.GetBestName] seems rather honorable. Perhaps [From.GetHerHis] religion is less dishonorable than I have been led to believe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2764;I should keep an open mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2764;[From.GetHerHis] ways are wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2765;I was rather surprised to learn that your mentor, [From.GetBestName], is not as prejudiced towards the [Root.Religion.GetName] religion as many other Warriors of the Rising Sun are. [From.GetSheHeCap] has even gone as far as saying that my honor proves that it would be foolish to dismiss an entire religion as being inherently dishonorable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2765;I'm glad to hear that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2766;Both I and [From.GetBestName] follow religions that are quite different from those that most members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun follow, and I am reasonably certain that both of us have faced prejudice as a result. Though our beliefs differ it might be worth setting aside our differences as we are both seen as outsiders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2766;Let's learn from each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2766;[From.GetBestName]'s religion is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2767;Both I and [From.GetBestName] follow religions that are quite different from those that most members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun follow, and I am reasonably certain that both of us have faced prejudice as a result. It is possible that things would be easier for both of us if we set aside our differences, seeing as we are both regarded as outsiders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2767;Let's learn from each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2767;The [Root.Religion.GetName] is the only true religion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2768;[From.GetBestName] and I are both devout followers of the [Root.Religion.GetName] religion, which is something that other Warriors of the Rising Sun often hold against us. Given that it is doubtful that the prejudice we face will disappear anytime soon it is certainly good to know that I am not alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2768;We're in this together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2769;[From.GetBestName] and I are both devout followers of the [Root.Religion.GetName] religion, which is something that other Warriors of the Rising Sun often hold against us. Given that it is doubtful that the prejudice we face will disappear anytime soon it is certainly good to know that I am not alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2769;We're in this together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2770;[From.GetBestName] has been my student for a while now, and I feel that the two of us have become quite close as a result. Perhaps our relationship should change from simply being a relationship between metor and student and take on a more intimate character? It is not completely unheard of for such things to happen, after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2770;I will proposition them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2770;Me and [From.GetHerHim]? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2771;[From.GetBestName] has been mentoring me in the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun for a while, and the two of us have become rather close as a result. Even so, I was taken by surprise when [From.GetSheHe] suggested that perhaps the two of us should have a much more intimate relationship than we currently have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2771;What a lovely idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2771;Me and [From.GetHerHim]? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2772;[From.GetBestName] was quite flattered by my suggestion, and it did not take the two of us a long time to find a secluded location for lovemaking. Though we certainly still need to spend some time on activities related to training [From.GetBestName] to become a better Warrior of the Rising Sun that will definitely not be the only thing we do together in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2772;This is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2773;I approached [From.GetBestName] with the suggestion of a more intimate relationship, but though the two of us have become close [From.GetBestName] courteously but firmly told me that [From.GetSheHe] does not wish for a more intimate relationship and that [From.GetSheHe] thinks such a relationship with [Root.GetHerHis] mentor would be rather improper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2773;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2774;I have been working closely together with [From.GetBestName] for a while now, and both of us definitely enjoy each other's company. Though we might not always be working as closely together in the future I would say we have become friends for life, and that friendship will doubtlessly give me an ally should I ever need one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2774;We shall stand together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2775;I have been working closely together with [From.GetBestName] for a while now, and both of us definitely enjoy each other's company. Though we might not always be working as closely together in the future I would say we have become friends for life, and that friendship will doubtlessly give me an ally should I ever need one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2775;We shall stand together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2776;Personal combat is something that every Warrior of the Rising Sun should be familiar with, but a true Warrior of the Rising Sun should also be a good commander. I should probably spend some time discussing both strategy and tactics while mentoring [From.GetBestName] as a result, rather than just dealing with weaponry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2776;Let's discuss warfare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2776;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2777;My mentor, [From.GetBestName], has told me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that it is time for the two of us to spend some time discussing both strategy and tactics. [From.GetSheHeCap] clearly feels that a true Warrior of the Rising Sun should be as capable at commanding others as [Root.GetSheHe] is at personal combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2777;Sounds like a plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2777;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2778;One day I and [From.GetBestName] pass by a group of shirabyoshi when taking a walk. They are dressed in their traditional outfit, which of course is something that only would be worn by men otherwise. I have seen some entertaining shirabyoshi performances in the past, but at times their outfits, particularly the swords, have felt out of place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2778;Women with swords! How silly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2778;Let's not be too hasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2779;One day when I am taking a walk with [From.GetBestName] we pass by a group of shirabyoshi wearing their traditional outfits. Apparently [From.GetBestName] has a low opinion about those outfits, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] tells you that [From.GetSheHe] does not think they deserve to be walking around carrying swords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2779;I agree with that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2779;Actually, I think you're wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2780;It seems [From.GetBestName] does not share my opinion about shirabyoshi. [From.GetSheHeCap] rather firmly tells me that I am not right when I claim that it is rather silly for them to be carrying swords, and [From.GetSheHe] might even think that they could be skilled enough with them to actually deserve them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2780;[From.GetSheHeCap] is clearly wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2781;One day I and [From.GetBestName] pass by a group of shirabyoshi as we are taking a walk together. They are dressed in their traditional outfit, which would be out of place on any woman who is not a shirabyoshi, and most would probably say the same about their swords. However, maybe they are as worthy of their swords as I am of mine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2781;They sure could be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2781;They aren't warriors...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2782;As I and my mentor, [From.GetBestName], are walking together one day we pass by a group of shirabyoshi wearing their traditional outfits. My mentor comments on the fact that they carry swords at their side and that some would say that shirabyoshi are unworthy of them, but she claims that anyone that has met her should know women certainly can be worthy of swords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2782;You might be right about that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2782;They are not true warriors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2783;It seems my student, [From.GetBestName], does not share my opinion about shirabyoshi, as [From.GetSheHe] angrily says that they make a mockery of true warriors everywhere and that respecting them is uncalled for, since even though I am a female warrior that does not mean that women are suited to be warriors in general.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2783;What a rude thing to day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2784;One day I and [From.GetBestName] pass by a group of shirabyoshi as we are walking together. They are dressed in their traditional outfit, which of course is something that otherwise only would be worn by men, and they also carry swords at their side. Perhaps I should warn my student that she should work hard to prove herself better than them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2784;I really should!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2784;Let's not be hasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2785;As I and [From.GetBestName] are walking together one day we pass by a group of shirabyoshi wearing their traditional outfits, including their swords. [From.GetBestName] takes the opportunity to tell me that I need to work hard to show that I am more worthy of my sword than the shirabyoshi are of theirs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2785;I'll not say anything...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2785;That was rather insulting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2786;It seems that my student, [From.GetBestName], does not share my opinion about shirabyoshi, as [From.GetSheHe] angrily says that I should not be so hasty in dismissing either them or her. She also claims that women can be just as good at fighting as men but that they just do not get the opportunity to prove it very often.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2786;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2787;One day I and [From.GetBestName] pass by a group of shirabyoshi as wa are walking together. They are dressed in their traditional outfit, which of course is something that otherwise only would be worn by men, and they also carry swords at their side, much like me and my student, and it is certainly not something that should be discouraged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2787;We all deserve to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2788;As I and my mentor, [From.GetBestName], are walking together one day we pass by a group of shirabyoshi wearing their traditional outfits. My mentor comments on the fact that they are carrying swords at their side, much like the two of us are, and states that women should be permitted to carry and wield them if they wish to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2788;We all deserve to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2789;I have been a Warrior of the Rising Sun for quite some time, and though the Warriors of the Rising Sun pride themselves on their honor I have always thought that there are times when honor simply is not the most important concern. Perhaps I should make [From.GetBestName] aware of this, even if there are those that would disapprove.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2789;[From.GetSheHeCap] needs to hear this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2789;I think not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2790;I have always been told that a Warrior of the Rising Sun should act with honor at all time, and I had expected my mentor, [From.GetBestName], to share this sentiment. However, [From.GetSheHe] has just seen fit to tell me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that there are times that honor should be ignored in favor of other considerations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2790;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2790;This is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2791;My attempt to teach [From.GetBestName] that honor is not always of utmost importance has gone poorly. [From.GetSheHeCap] rather firmly told me that [From.GetSheHe] strongly disagrees with this sentiment, and though [From.GetSheHe] does not seem to hold what I said against me I doubt I will be able to convince [From.GetHerHim] to see things my way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2791;Unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2792;I and [From.GetBestName] have come to dislike each another quite a bit since I first started mentoring [From.GetHerHim]. I cannot simply stop mentoring [From.GetHerHim] because I dislike [From.GetHerHim], and I am not prepared to declare [From.GetHerHim] worthy of being a full Warrior of the Rising Sun just to get rid of [From.GetHerHim], but maybe I could seriously injure [From.GetHerHim] in a duel...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2792;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2792;I think not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2793;I and [From.GetBestName] do not exactly see eye-to-eye, and I suspect that both of us would like nothing more than to be rid of one another. [From.GetSheHeCap] has now suggested a practice duel to first blood, and though it would be unwise to try to kill [From.GetHerHim] I could try to harm [From.GetHerHim] quite a bit if I accept the challenge...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2793;Challenge accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2793;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2794;It seems [From.GetBestName] has no interest in my proposed practice duel. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] saw through my plan to push things as far as I could without actively killing [From.GetHerHim] and elected not to take the risk, or perhaps [From.GetSheHe] is just a coward that does not deserve as good a teacher as me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2794;I think it is cowardice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2795;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood does not go the way I had intended for it to go. In fact, it goes about as poorly as it could go, short of my student killing me. [From.GetSheHeCap] easily avoids my attacks and quickly injures me in a major way. If the duel had not been to first blood, [From.GetSheHe] could easily have killed me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2795;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2796;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood goes about as well as I had hoped. [From.GetSheHeCap] makes a few feeble attempts to wound me that I easily avoid, and I quickly manage to inflict a grievious wound on [From.GetHerHim] despite [From.GetHerHis] attempts to prevent me from doing just that. Clearly, I am the better warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2796;You truly are a poor teacher!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2797;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood does not go the way I had intended for it to go. Though I manage to hold [From.GetHerHim] off for a while and come close to wounding [From.GetHerHim] [From.GetSheHe] eventually gains the upper hand and manages to wound me. It seems like it was a bad idea to issue the challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2797;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2798;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood goes quite well, all things considered. Though it takes a while before it is decided I manage to block all of [From.GetHerHis] attacks before they can draw blood and eventually manage to get past [From.GetHerHis] defenses to wound [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2798;You deserve no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2799;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood goes about as well as I had planned. [From.GetSheHeCap] makes a few feeble attempts to wound me that I easily deal with, and I quickly manage to inflict a grievious wound on [From.GetHerHim] as [From.GetHerHis] ability to defend [From.GetHerselfHimself] clearly is lacking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2799;You truly are a poor student!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2800;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood does not go the way I had hoped. In fact, it goes about as poorly as it could go, short of my mentor killing me. [From.GetSheHeCap] easily avoids my sword and quickly wonds me in a major way. It seems like it was a bad idea to accept the challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2800;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2801;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood goes quite well, all things considered. Though it takes a while before it is decided I manage to block all of [From.GetHerHis] attacks before they can draw blood and eventually manage to get past [From.GetHerHis] defenses to wound [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2801;You deserve no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2802;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood does not go the way I had intended for it to go. Though I manage to hold [From.GetHerHim] off for a while and come close to wounding [From.GetHerHim] [From.GetSheHe] eventually gains the upper hand and manages to wound me. It seems like it was a bad idea to accept the challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2802;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2803;While [From.GetBestName] is a promising student [From.GetSheHe] still has quite far to go before [From.GetSheHe] is worthy to progress any further as a Warrior of the Rising Sun. However, from the way [From.GetSheHe] has been acting it seems as if [From.GetSheHe] thinks otherwise, and telling [From.GetHerHim] otherwise might upset [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2803;I suppose I could lower the bar...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2803;[From.GetSheHeCap] is not ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2804;[From.GetBestName] summons me for what I expect to be routine training session even though I have started to believe that [From.GetSheHe] cannot teach me anything more at this point. However, to my great pleasure, [From.GetSheHe] instead declares that my training is at an end as I have proven myself a skilled warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2804;I knew I was ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2805;[From.GetBestName] summons me one day and tells me that even though I might think that I have all but reached the point where I have proven proven myself worthy of being a full Warrior of the Rising Sun my training is not yet complete. [From.GetSheHeCap] implies that I will not be done for quite some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2805;I suppose you know best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2805;I am ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2806;It seems [From.GetBestName] has become convinced that I am intentionally holding [From.GetHerHim] back. Though this certainly is not the case, my attempt to convince [From.GetHerHim] otherwise only ends up making things worse. It soon becomes quite clear that [From.GetSheHe] now views me as an enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2806;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2807;[From.GetBestName] is a most promising student, and as far as I can tell [From.GetSheHe] is skilled enough that nobody would fault me for declaring [From.GetHerHis] training over. I could of course also delay it, in case I do not wish for [From.GetBestName] to advance further in the ranks of the Warriors of the Rising Sun, even though that would be dishonorable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2807;[From.GetSheHeCap] is ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2807;I think I will delay this a bit...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2808;[From.GetBestName] summons me for what I expect to be routine training session even though I have started to believe that [From.GetSheHe] cannot teach me anything more at this point. However, to my great pleasure, [From.GetSheHe] instead declares that my training is at an end as I have proven myself a skilled warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2808;I knew I was ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

[From.GetSheHeCap] implies that I will not be done for quite some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2809;I suppose you know best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2809;I am ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2810;It seems [From.GetBestName] has become convinced that I am intentionally holding [From.GetHerHim] back. This is of course the case, and my attempt to lie to [From.GetHerHim] about this only ends up making things worse. It soon becomes quite clear that [From.GetSheHe] now views me as an enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2810;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2811;My student, [From.GetBestName], apparently thinks that [From.GetSheHe] is being held back even though I are not holding [From.GetHerHim] back, as [From.GetSheHe] has told me as much to your face. Clearly, I will need to tell [From.GetHerHim] the truth, and I will need to do so in a convincing fashion to avoid turning [From.GetHerHim] into an enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2811;You truly are not ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2812;For a while now I have been suspecting that my mentor, [From.GetBestName], has been holding me back and that I perhaps already had proven that I am worthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun. However, when I confronted [From.GetBestName] about it [From.GetSheHe] quickly managed to convince me otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2812;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2813;For a while now I have been suspecting that my mentor, [From.GetBestName], has been holding me back and that I perhaps already had proven that I am worthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun. When I confronted [From.GetBestName] about it [From.GetHerHis] response was highly suspect, and I doubt [From.GetSheHe]was telling the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2813;You lie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2814;My attempt to convince [From.GetBestName] that [From.GetSheHe] is in need of further training did not go as intended, as [From.GetSheHe] took what I said as confirmation that I have been holding [From.GetHerHim] back even though that is not the truth. As a consequence of this [From.GetBestName] now seems to view me as an enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2814;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2815;[From.GetBestName]'s training has now reached the point where it would be pointless to continue it any further as [From.GetSheHe] definitely is worthy of being a full Warrior of the Rising Sun. It it time to inform [From.GetHerHim] of the good news, and perhaps also time to look for another student if there is anyone else in need of a mentor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2815;I can teach you no more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2816;[From.GetBestName] summons me for what I expect to be routine training session even though I have started to believe that [From.GetSheHe] cannot teach me anything more at this point. However, to my great pleasure, [From.GetSheHe] instead declares that my training is at an end as I have proven myself a skilled warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2816;I knew I was ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2817;I and [From.GetBestName] are both students of [FromFrom.GetBestName], and we have sometimes had shared lessons together with our mentor. As a result we have gotten to know each other quite well, and I feel certain that I would be able to count on [From.GetBestName] as a friend and ally if I ever need [From.GetHerHis] assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2817;Together we will be unstoppable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2818;I and [From.GetBestName] are both students of [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], and we have sometimes had shared lessons together with our mentor.

EVTOPTA_SOH_2818;Together we will be unstoppable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2819;I have spent quite a bit of time in the company of [From.GetBestName] due to our shared mentor. I have always felt that [From.GetSheHe] is rather attractive, and I have enjoyed [From.GetHerHis] company quite a bit, and perhaps we could have a rather more intimate relationship, if that is something that would appeal to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2819;I should approach [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2819;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2820;I have spent quite a bit of time in the company of [From.GetBestName] as the two of us share a mentor. I have always found [From.GetHerHis] company quite enjoyable, and [From.GetSheHe] is rather good attractive, too. One day [From.GetBestName] suggests that perhaps the two of us should get to know each other rather more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2820;I like the way you think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2820;What? No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2821;[From.GetBestName] turns out to be quite interested in me as well, and it does not take the two of us long to find somewhere private to get to know each other rather more intimately. Though we probably should be discreet about our relationship going forward, it will certainly make our shared lessons even more enjoyable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2821;I knew this would end well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2822;Though [From.GetBestName] is quite courteous it is clear that [From.GetSheHe] is not at all interested in the idea of getting to know me more intimately. While it hopefully will not result in things between the us becoming strained, it certainly was not what I was hoping for when I choose to approach [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2822;Well, that went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2823;I share a mentor with [From.GetBestName] in [FromFrom.GetBestName], and this has resulted in the three of us having several lessons together. Though I initially had hoped that I would get along with my fellow student it has become rather clear to me that that is not going to happen since [From.GetBestName] is highly competitive and clearly sees me as a rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2823;You will never be my equal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2824;I share a mentor with [From.GetBestName] in [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], and this has resulted in the three of us having several lessons together.

EVTOPTA_SOH_2824;You will never be my equal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2825;As I and [From.GetBestName] both are trying to prove our worth to [FromFrom.GetBestName] we have sometimes gotten together to spar with one another between our official lessons since that might help us advance more quickly. We have recently spent a bit more time doing this than before, and as far as I can tell it is starting to yield some results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2825;We have both learned a few things;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_2826;We have both learned a few things;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2827;I have spent some time around [From.GetBestName] as the two of us share a mentor in [FromFrom.GetBestName], and in my opinion [From.GetSheHe] has always been acting a bit dishonestly. Today I found irrefutable proof that [From.GetSheHe] has been lying, which probably is information that [FromFrom.GetBestName] would be quite interested in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2827;I should confront [From.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2827;I will let this slide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2828;It seems [From.GetBestName] has managed to discover proof that I have not been completely honest at all times recently, as [From.GetSheHe] has confronted me with this information and is indicating that [From.GetSheHe] might tell [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] about it. It is possible that a bribe might be able to buy [From.GetBestName]'s silence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2828;How about some money?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2828;How about a Favor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2828;I'm calling in my Favor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_2828;Do your worst!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2829;[From.GetBestName] was evidently interested in securing my silence when I confronted [From.GetHerHim] about [From.GetHerHis] dishonesty, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] immediately offered to pay me quite a bit of money to make me forget about the matter. It would be dishonorable to accept a bribe, of course, but surely nobody would ever know...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2829;We have a deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2829;I will not be bribed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2830;[From.GetBestName] was evidently interested in securing my silence when I confronted [From.GetHerHim] about [From.GetHerHis] dishonesty, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] immediately offered to grant me a Favor to make me forget about the matter.

EVTOPTA_SOH_2830;We have a deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2830;I will not be bribed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2831;I would have thought that the offer of a bribe would have convinced [From.GetBestName] to drop the matter of my occasional lie to our shared mentor, but evidently [From.GetSheHe] is a bit too honorable for that to be the case. [From.GetSheHeCap] laughed at my offer before leaving to speak with our mentor about what [From.GetSheHe] had discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2831;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2832;It seems [From.GetBestName] has come across evidence that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been lying to me. Though it is possible that this evidence could have been fabricated I know that [FromFrom.GetBestName] usually is less trustworthy than [From.GetBestName], so this accusation is likely true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2832;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2833;[From.GetBestName] was evidently interested in securing my silence when I confronted [From.GetHerHim] about [From.GetHerHis] dishonesty, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] immediately called in the Favor that I owed [From.GetHerHim]. As it would not do to fail to honor the Favor I have no choice but to remain silent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2833;I suppose that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2834;I would have thought that [From.GetBestName] would offer me some kind of bribe in exchange for my silence on the matter of [From.GetHerHis] dishonesty, but [From.GetSheHe] laughed in mu face and told me to do your worst, stating that [From.GetSheHe] has nothing to fear from any accusations I might make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2834;As you wish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2835;It seems [From.GetBestName] has come across evidence that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been lying to me. Though it is possible that this evidence could have been fabricated I know that [FromFrom.GetBestName] usually is less trustworthy than [From.GetBestName], so this accusation is likely true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2835;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2836;I and [From.GetBestName] have a shared mentor in [FromFrom.GetBestName], and we have been given all manner of lessons together. Now both of us have been tasked with reading about warfare in the Art of War and similar books, and we would definitely learn faster working together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_2838;My rival, [From.GetBestName], and I have the same mentor, [FromFrom.GetBestName]. I have long hoped that my mentor would have dismissed such a worthless student, but it has not happened yet. Perhaps I could change that if I proved that [From.GetBestName] truly is a terrible warrior by wounding [From.GetHerHim] in a duel... preferably severely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2838;I'll issue a challenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2838;I have better things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2839;I and [From.GetBestName] do not exactly see eye-to-eye, and I suspect that both of us would like nothing more than to be rid of each other. [From.GetSheHeCap] has now suggested a practice duel to first blood, and though it would be unwise to try to kill [From.GetHerHim] I could try to harm [From.GetHerHim] quite a bit in such a duel...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2839;Challenge accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2839;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2840;It seems my rival, [From.GetBestName], has no interest in my proposed duel. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] saw through my plan to try to injure [From.GetHerHim] severely and elected not to take the risk, but it is also possible [From.GetSheHe] is just a coward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2840;I think it is cowardice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2841;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood does not go the way I had intended for it to go. In fact, it goes about as poorly as it could go, short of my student killing me. [From.GetSheHeCap] easily avoids my attacks and quickly injures me in a major way. If the duel had not been to first blood, [From.GetSheHe] could easily have killed me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2841;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2842;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood goes about as well as I had hoped. [From.GetSheHeCap] makes a few feeble attempts to wound me that I easily avoid, and I quickly manage to inflict a grievious wound on [From.GetHerHim] despite [From.GetHerHis] attempts to prevent me from doing just that. Clearly, I am the better warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2842;You truly are a poor warrior!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2843;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood does not go the way I had intended for it to go. Though I manage to hold [From.GetHerHim] off for a while and come close to wounding [From.GetHerHim] [From.GetSheHe] eventually gains the upper hand and manages to wound me. It seems like it was a bad idea to issue the challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2843;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2844;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood goes quite well, all things considered. Though it takes a while before it is decided I manage to block all of [From.GetHerHis] attacks before they can draw blood and eventually manage to get past [From.GetHerHis] defenses to wound [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2844;You deserve no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2845;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood goes about as well as I had planned. [From.GetSheHeCap] makes a few feeble attempts to wound me that I easily deal with, and I quickly manage to inflict a grievious wound on [From.GetHerHim] as [From.GetHerHis] ability to defend [From.GetHerselfHimself] clearly is lacking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2845;You truly are a poor warrior!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2846;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood does not go the way I had hoped. In fact, it goes about as poorly as it could go, short of my mentor killing me. [From.GetSheHeCap] easily avoids my sword and quickly wonds me in a major way. It seems like it was a bad idea to accept the challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2846;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2847;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood goes quite well, all things considered. Though it takes a while before it is decided I manage to block all of [From.GetHerHis] attacks before they can draw blood and eventually manage to get past [From.GetHerHis] defenses to wound [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2847;You deserve no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2848;The duel I and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood does not go the way I had intended for it to go. Though I manage to hold [From.GetHerHim] off for a while and come close to wounding [From.GetHerHim] [From.GetSheHe] eventually gains the upper hand and manages to wound me. It seems like it was a bad idea to accept the challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2848;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2849;I have known that [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have considered one another rivals for some time even though I have done my best to try to smooth things over. Now it seems that the two of them have fought a duel against one another, and that one of them has walked away from it in rather bad shape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2849;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2850;I and [From.GetBestName] share a mentor in [FromFrom.GetBestName], and though she seems to be respected by my mentor I are not quite sure she deserves that respect as I have heard many Warriors of the Rising Sun say that women should not be fighting except in truly dire circumstances. Perhaps they are right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2850;She will never be a proper warrior!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2850;I suppose she could have what it takes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2851;I have faced a good amount of prejudice among the Warriors of the Rising Sun as quite a few of them seem to be of the opinion that I will end up disappointing everyone, seemingly for no reason other than that I am a woman. It seems my fellow student, [From.GetBestName], shares this sentiment, as he has told me as much to my face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2851;I can ignore this insult...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2851;It is you who will be the disappointment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2852;It seems [From.GetBestName] did not like being called out on being a poor warrior by virtue of being a woman. She angrily told me that she will not only prove herself worthy of being one of the Warriors of the Rising Sun but also will prove to everyone that she always will be my better, and that I will rue the day I made an enemy of her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2852;An empty threat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2853;I and [From.GetBestName] are both women and have both faced quite a bit of prejudice from other Warriors of the Rising Sun as a result as many of them do not seem to grasp the fact that a woman can be just as good a warrior as a man can be. This has brought us closer to each other, and I would say that we likely will be friends for life..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2853;We shall stand together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2854;I and [From.GetBestName] are both women and have both faced quite a bit of prejudice from other Warriors of the Rising Sun as a result as many of them do not seem to grasp the fact that a woman can be just as good a warrior as a man can be. This has brought us closer to each other, and I would say that we likely will be friends for life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2854;We shall stand together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2855;One of my friends, [FromFrom.GetBestName], is currently mentoring [From.GetBestName] in the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun. I have had a good number of interactions with the two of them recently, and I have discovered that I and [From.GetBestName] have quite a few things in common and feel that the two of us likely will be friends for life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2855;We shall stand together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2856;[From.GetBestName], a friend of my mentor, [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], and we have spent some time together recently due to your shared obligations as Warriors of the Rising Sun. I have gotten to know [From.GetHerHim] quite well as a result and definitely enjoy [From.GetHerHis] company, and it seems like [From.GetSheHe] also enjoys my company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2856;I have made a friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2857;I have spent some time in the companty of {FromFrom.GetBestName] and [From.GetBestName] recently, and it seems as if the two of them are getting along quite well. As [FromFrom.GetBestName] is a close friend of mine this is likely going to be beneficial for my student in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2857;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2858;Though there are members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun that are quite worthy of the honor of being part of the society there are also members that really are unworthy of membership, such as my rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], and [FromFrom.GetHerHis] student, [From.GetBestName], a truly unpleasant [From.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2858;They are both my enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2859;My mentor, [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], has made no secret of the fact that [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] and [From.GetBestName] dislike one another, and while I have been trying to keep an open mind I have realized that [From.GetBestName] clearly does not respect me and sees me as an enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2859;I must oppose [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2860;I have spoken at length about the dishonorable cretin that is [FromFrom.GetBestName] to my student, [From.GetBestName], and at times it has seemed as if my words have fallen on deaf ears. However, as of today I have learned that my student has come to agree with me about my hated rival, and that [From.GetSheHe] seeks to oppose [FromFrom.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2860;Good! Good! Destroy [FromFrom.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2861;My hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], is currently mentoring [From.GetBestName], and from what I have heard [From.GetSheHe] is rather promising student. Though some would view it as dishonorable, maybe I should try to convince [From.GetBestName] to become my student instead, as it would humiliate my rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2861;I should approach [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2861;It's not worth it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2863;One day when I am on the way to meet with my mentor, [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], I am approached by [From.GetBestName], my mentor's rival. [From.GetSheHeCap] suggests that my potential is being squandered by my mentor and suggests that [From.GetSheHe] would be a better mentor. Even if it is a dishonorable offer, perhaps it is worth accepting?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2863;I pledge myself to you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2863;I will never be your student!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2864;I make my offer to [From.GetBestName] and am quite pleased to discover that [From.GetSheHe] is open to the suggestion that I should take over as [From.GetHerHis] mentor. It brings me even more satisfaction to be present when my new student informs [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName] that [From.GetSheHe] now will be taking lessons from me instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2864;Just as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2865;My student, [From.GetBestName], arrives slightly later than expected to our lesson, and to my surprise my hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], arrives along with [From.GetHerHim]. I quickly discover that my rival has convinced my student that [From.GetSheHe] would be better off being mentored by [FromFrom.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2865;You both lack honor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2866;I expected [From.GetBestName] to at least give the suggestion that I should become [From.GetHerHis] mentor instead of [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName] some consideration before making up [From.GetHerHis] mind, but [From.GetSheHe] immediately informed me that [From.GetSheHe] was not going to abandon [From.GetHerHis] current mentor in no uncertain terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2866;What a disappointment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2867;My student, [From.GetBestName], arrives slightly later than expected to our lesson. [From.GetSheHeCap] informs me that [FromFrom.GetBestName], my hated rival, apparently demanded to speak to [From.GetHerHim] and suggested that [From.GetSheHe] should become [FromFrom.GetHerHis] student instead, but that [From.GetSheHe] refused this dishonorable suggestion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2867;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2868;Among the many Novices seeking to prove themselves worthy of progressing further in the Warriors of the Rising Sun is [From.GetBestName], who clearly shows promise. One day the two of us meet by pure chance, and I see an opportunity to give [From.GetBestName] some quick advice to help [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2868;Here's a quick tip!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2869;I have occasionally come across other members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun than my mentor during my training, and though some of them have seen fit to largely ignore me others have been rather helpful. One of the more helpful people I have met is [From.GetBestName], who recently gave me some good advice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2869;[From.GetSheHeCap] certainly helped me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2870;I have met a good number of Warriors of the Rising Sun over the years, and many of them have been quite dismissive towards me because I am a woman. Doubtlessly, this is something that [From.GetBestName] also will encounter over the years to come, and she would probably have an easier time if she got some help from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2870;I'll give her some advice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2871;[From.GetBestName] approaches me one day to express her appreciation of the fact that I have joined the Warriors of the Rising Sun despite the fact that many of the men in the society are of the opinion that women should not be members. She offers me a few quick tips as to how I could deal with the situation and how I could prove myself worthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2871;My thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2872;[FromFrom.GetBestName] and I have both faced prejudice because we are women and many Warriors of the Rising Sun find it hard to accept that we are skilled warriors. Doubtlessly, this is something that [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s student, [From.GetBestName], will have to deal with as well, and she woud probably have an easier time if she got a few tips.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2872;I'll give her some advice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2873;[From.GetBestName] approaches me one day to express her appreciation of the fact that I have joined the Warriors of the Rising Sun despite the fact that many of the men in the society are of the opinion that women should not be members. She offers me a few quick tips as to how I could deal with the situation and how I could prove myself worthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2873;My thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2874;My mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are bitter rivals, and the two of them always seek to prove that the other lacks honor. Now it seems that [From.GetBestName] dislikes me, perhaps because of [From.GetHerHis] mentor's influence, and [From.GetSheHe] seems determined to prove that I am unworthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2874;It is you who are unworthy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2875;My mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are bitter rivals, and the two of them always seek to prove that the other lacks honor. Now it seems that [From.GetBestName] dislikes me, perhaps because of [From.GetHerHis] mentor's influence, and [From.GetSheHe] seems determined to prove that I am unworthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2875;It is you who are unworthy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2876;Though my mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are bitter rivals I and [From.GetBestName] have always gotten along quite well. Though I suspect that our respective mentors would prefer otherwise, the two of us are determined to not get caught up in their dispute and intend to work together in the name of honor and glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2876;We need not be foes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2877;Though my mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are bitter rivals I and [From.GetBestName] have always gotten along quite well. Though I suspect that our respective mentors would prefer otherwise, the two of us are determined to not get caught up in their dispute and intend to work together in the name of honor and glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2877;We need not be foes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2878;Though my mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are bitter rivals I have never had anything against [From.GetBestName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems to thoroughly enjoy my company, and I enjoy [From.GetHerHis] company as well and also find [From.GetHerHim] rather attractive. Maybe we should take our relationship in a more intimate direction...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2878;I should approach [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2878;It's not worth it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2879;One day I am approached by [From.GetBestName], the student of a rival of my mentor. The two of us have always gotten along rather well despite our respective mentors not getting along, and [From.GetSheHe] now suggests that the two of us perhaps should take our relationship in a more intimate direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2879;That sounds lovely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2879;You and me? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2880;[From.GetBestName] is quite receptive to my suggestion that the two of us should begin a more intimate relationship, and the two of us quickly find a location where we can have some privacy. Though our mentors doubtlessly would be quite displeased to discover that the two of us now are lovers hopefully we will be able to avoid discovery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2880;I'm sure it'll be fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2881;When approached on the matter [From.GetBestName] informs me that [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in a more intimate relationship with me. Perhaps it is because our mentors would find it highly disagreeable if they ever found out, or perhaps [From.GetBestName] simply is not interested in intimacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2881;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2882;Though my mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are friends and they presumably would have preferred for me and [From.GetHerHim] to get along there is something infuriating about [From.GetBestName] that makes it impossible for me to stand [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is clearly devoid of honor, and does not deserve my respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2882;[From.GetSheHeCap] will never be my equal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2883;Though my mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are friends and they presumably would have preferred for me and [From.GetHerHim] to get along there is something infuriating about [From.GetBestName] that makes it impossible for me to stand [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is clearly devoid of honor, and does not deserve my respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2883;[From.GetSheHeCap] will never be my equal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2884;It is no secret that my mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are friends, and the two of us have also been getting along quite well when we have spent time together. Though there might be Warriors of the Rising Sun that are dishonorable and unworthy, [From.GetBestName] is certainly not one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2884;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2885;It is no secret that my mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are friends, and the two of us have also been getting along quite well when we have spent time together. Though there might be Warriors of the Rising Sun that are dishonorable and unworthy, [From.GetBestName] is certainly not one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2885;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2886;Since my mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are close friends it is only natural that the two of us have been spending quite some time in each other's company, and I feel that the two of us are getting along quite well. [From.GetSheHeCap] is also rather attractive, so maybe I should see if [From.GetSheHe] is interested in a more intimate relationship...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2886;It is worth a shot...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2886;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2887;Since my mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are close friends it is only natural that the two of us have been spending quite some time in each other's company, and the two of us have been getting along quite well. It seems like [From.GetSheHe] thinks we should be even closer, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] just propositioned me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2887;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2887;Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2888;[From.GetBestName] is appreciative of my suggestion, and the two of us soon manage to find someplace private to take our relationship to the next level. Though we perhaps should keep our relationship a secret in case others disapprove of it, it will very likely make future meetings between the two of us even more pleasant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2888;This is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2889;Thouhg [From.GetBestName] is quite courteous in the way [From.GetSheHe] goes about the matter [From.GetSheHe] still firmly turns down mu suggestion that the two of us should consider a more intimate relationship. Perhaps it is for the best, seeing as there might be those that would disapprove of such a relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2889;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2890;I have spoken with other Novices in the Warriors of the Rising Sun from time to time during ,y training to see what they were being taught, occasionally getting small tips from them as to how I could improve more quickly. I have also been able to give advice at times, such as when I came across [From.GetBestName] today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2890;Here's a quick tip!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2891;It is not uncommon for ,e to speak with other Novices seeking to prove themselves true Warriors of the Rising Sun from time to time to exchange small bits of advice that might be helpful. Recently I got a bit of advice from [From.GetBestName] that I think will be quite helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2891;That was helpful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2892;There has always been a small number of women among the Warriors of the Rising Sun, and some of them have been anything but worthy of that honor. I have recently considered [From.GetBestName]'s suitability, wondering if she is someone that deserves to be a Warrior of the Rising Sun. If not, I should probably let her know that she is unworthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2892;She is unworthy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2892;She could have what it takes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2893;It seems that [From.GetBestName] is one of the members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun that is unwilling to accept the fact that a woman could pick up a weapon and wield it just as well as a man as he has told me as much to my face. Maybe he phrased it poorly, or maybe he meant for it to be as insulting as it sounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2893;I'm probably overreacting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2893;I am more worthy than he is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2894;[From.GetBestName] did not take me informing her that she might be unfit to be a Warrior of the Rising Sun well, which perhaps was not all that suprising, and she angrily proclaimed that she was far more worthy of that honor than I ever will be and that I one day will rue the day that I made an enemy of her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2894;She's clearly in denial!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2895;Even though I have not been a member of the Warriors of the Rising Sun for a very long time I have encountered quite a few men who have told me that they do not think I should be a warrior. Doubtlessly [From.GetBestName] has experienced similar prejudice, and she could probably use a friend as much as I could.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2895;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2896;Even though I have not been a member of the Warriors of the Rising Sun for a very long time I have encountered quite a few men who have told me that they do not think I should be a warrior. Doubtlessly [From.GetBestName] has experienced similar prejudice, and she could probably use a friend as much as I could.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2896;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2903;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nThe approximate location of one of the greatest warriors in the world -- the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] -- has been determined. You must seek out this champion and defeat them in an honorable duel.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2903;I'll depart at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2905;As I am passing through a village on my way to where the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] supposedly can be found one of the villagers is behaving very rudely towards me, doing his best to get in the way of my horse and making several unflattering comments about me and my chosen attire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2905;Such insolence must be punished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2905;I'll just ride off...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2906;I pull out my sword and cut the offensive man down with a single swift strike, as is my right as a warrior. Unfortunately, the other villagers appear to be horrified by my behaviour, and they demand that I leave the village at once as they do not want any further trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2906;I suppose I should leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2907;I draw your sword and cut the offensive man down with a single swift strike, as is my right as a warrior. The villagers nearby cry out in dismay, and soon a large number of guards surround me. After hearing what happened they demand that I pay a fine, as their customs apparently do not allow warriors to cut down rude commoners at will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2907;I'll pay your fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2907;I'll kill you all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2907;Time to run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2908;The guards that had surrounded me did evidently not anticipate that I would consider fighting them as they are completely surprised by my attack. By the time that the survivours start to recover I have already cut half of them down, and the other half does not put up significant resistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2908;Was that all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2909;I attack the guards surrounding me, catching many of them by surprise, and the battle is already in my favor by the time the less surprised ones can intervene. It takes me a while to finish the fight, but even though they injure me it is hardly in a concerning fashion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2909;'Tis but a scratch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2910;The guards are not particularly surprised by me electing to attack them, and they put up fierce resistance. The battle eventually turns in my favor, but though I come out alive it probably was a bad idea to fight the guards as they manage to injure me quite severely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2910;That hurt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2911;The guards are ready for my attack, and I am wounded almost as quickly as I move to attack them. Though I do my best to avoid their blows and try my best to strike back at them, the battle does not go my way, and soon I find myself lying on the ground, bleeding out from a large number of lethal wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2911;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2912;One evening when I am passing through a forest I hear the sound of people talking somewhere nearby. I cannot make out what they are saying, and as far as I can tell they are not in my immediate vicinity, but I am evidently not alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2912;I must investigate this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2912;I must investigate this... discreetly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2912;It is safest to leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2913;As I move around a large boulder I find the source of the voices I have been hearing. It seems a number of attractive young [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] are taking a bath together in a small pool in the forest and have been talking rather loudly while doing so. They have noticed my approach, and seem a bit surprised by my presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2913;Sorry to have bothered you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2913;May I join you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2914;I make my way towards the voices, moving carefully. As I crest a small hill I can see that a number of attractive young [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] are taking a bath together in a small pool in the forest, talking loudly while doing so. They do not appear to have noticed my presence yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2914;I'll not bother them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2914;I will ask to join them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2915;I make my way towards the voices, moving carefully, but I am not as careful as I would have liked. I trip over a branch and fall through a thick bush, emerging face-to-face with a number of attractive young [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] that are taking a bath together, talking loudly to one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2915;Sorry, I took a wrong turn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2915;May I join you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2916;I abandon stealth and move towards the bathing [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] openly, deciding that they likely will be more willing to hear me out if I let them see me coming. They appear to be surprised by my presence, but they do not indicate that my presence is unwelcome as I approach them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2916;May I join you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2917;The [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] taking a bath in the forest interrupt me before I am done trying to invite myself to join them, telling me that it would be best for everyone if I turned around and kept walking. Though it was not what I wanted to hear, it is clearly not worth pressing the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2917;Fine! Be that way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2918;The attractive young [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] quickly invite me to join them in the small pool they are bathing in, and I waste no time getting out of my clothes and joining them. We all seem to have a good time bathing, and I start to wonder if it perhaps would be worth trying to take things further...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2918;I'll not push my luck...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2918;It's worth a shot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2919;All of the attractive young [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] are open to the idea of doing something rather more intimate than just bathing together, and we waste no time before getting started. The evening turns out in a most wonderful fashion for everyone involved, and I do not regret asking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2919;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2920;All but one of the attractive young [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] sharing a bath with me find my suggestion outrageous and quickly make excuses to leave. One of them lingers behind, however, and before long the two of us are engaged in activities far more intimate than just sharing a bath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2920;I suppose that was a success...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2921;The attractive young [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] I am sharing a bath with are not happy with my suggestion that the six of us should do something more intimate, and they hurriedly make excuses to leave and disappear before I can try to convince them that they should stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2921;I should not have bothered...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2922;One day on the road I come across a preacher attempting to spread the word of the [preacher_province.Religion.GetName] faith to all who would listen. I am of course an adherent of the [Root.TrueReligion.GetName] faith, but perhaps there would not be any harm in listening to what the preacher is saying?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2922;I'll listen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2922;The [Root.TrueReligion.GetName] is the only true faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2923;There have been times during my journey to the location of the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] when I have misjudged how much food I would need to carry with me to have something to eat between villages. Though this at times has been unpleasant, I have come to realize that I actually do not need quite as much food as I previously would have thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2923;I could stand to eat less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2924;The roads I have been travelling on have at times been rather poor, and even when they have been good I have sometimes been journeying up steep hills or otherwise had a harder time than normal. Though there have been times when I have considered taking a less difficult path, my choice to not always do that has resulted in my endurance improving quite a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2924;I feel stronger now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2925;One day on the road a group of armed men and women suddenly appear and surround me. They are dressed in mismatched outfits of fairly low quality, so I am fairly convinced that they are bandits even before they demand that I hand over all of my valuables if I value my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2925;You'll die for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2925;How about just some of my money?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2925;Time to flee!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2926;The bandits that have surrounded me were clearly not prepared for an opponent as skilled as me, as they are taken completely by surprise when I attack them. Several of them fall before they can react, and though the rest of them attempt to fight back they are not even able to as much as wound me before they all fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2926;They stood no chance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2927;I manage to catch a few of the bandits by surprise and kill them quickly, but the others do not go down quite as easily. Though they are not particularly skilled at fighting there are quite a few of them, and even though I prevail they manage to wound me during the fighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2927;I suppose that went well enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2928;I do not really surprise the bandits by trying to fight them, and they manage to fight back quite well. It takes me more time than it probably should to come out on top, and though I eventually drive the last of the bandits I have taken a rather vicious wound in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2928;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2929;The bandits are prepared for my attack, and I am wounded before I even have raised my weapon. Though I do my best to make them reconsider what they are doing and manage to wound a few of them the battle does not go my way, and before long I take a fatal wound, then another, and another...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2929;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2930;Though some of the bandits definitely appear to be of the opinion that they should take all of my valuables even if that means that they would have to fight me their leader is open to the suggestion that I willingly part with a comparably small sum of gold in exchange for them leaving me in peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2930;That was probably the right move...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2931;The bandits laugh at the suggestion that they should be satisfied with a smaller amount of money that I would willingly part with in exchange for them leaving me alone. Only two options remain open to me now, and I need to make a decision before it is made for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2931;Time to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2931;Time to flee!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2932;Though I would have assumed that the bandits would have been prepared for the possibility that I would attempt to flee instead of fighting them they are taken completely by surprise, and I have put quite some distance behind them and me by the time that they react. They give chase for a while, but I eventually manage to lose them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2932;Phew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2933;The bandits fail to prevent me from fleeing, though they give chase easily enough, and some of them have ranged weapons. Though I eventually get far enough away from them that they are forced to abandon the pursuit I have still been injured. The wounds are fairly minor, but might still result in noticeable scars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2933;I suppose it could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2934;I have passed through many villages on my way to fight the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] can be found, and the locals have often taken an intrerest in me. Today that interest was in the form of several young children that noticed my weapons and asked if I would be willing to give them a few lessons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2934;Sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2934;Sorry, but no...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2934;Oh, I will teach you a "lesson"...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2935;The peasant children I agreed to give a quick lesson quickly picked up the basics that I initially had planned to teach them, and realizing that they might be ready to learn more I move on to more difficult things, which they also seem to get the hang of. Evidently they will be far more skilled warriors than I had thought possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2935;They had a good teacher!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2936;The peasant children seem to have played with wooden swords in the past, as they are not completely hopeless, but it still takes me quite some time to teach them what I would consider the essential basics that a warrior should know. They have improved a bit by the time I need to leave, but they are not particularly skilled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2936;I am not surprised;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2937;I had not expected the peasant children I agreed to teach to be particularly good, but I would at least have expected them to understand how to hold one of the wooden practice swords I instruct them to make. I do my best to teach them some of the basics, but I am unsure if they even managed to understand those.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2937;Why did I even bother?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2938;The peasant children are eager to be taught a lesson by my and are caught completely by surprise when I disarm them one by one and give them a thrashing. A couple of them attempt to fight back, but I disarm them again, and soon they are all running away, bruised, crying, and taught not to mess with their betters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2938;That concludes today's lesson!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2939;As I am passing through yet another village on my journey I notice that there is a local festival of some kind going on. I investigate it and learn that they will be holding an archery contest, and several of the villagers seem eager to compete against a foreigner as they offer to let me compete almost as soon as they spot me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2939;I'll compete!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2939;I'll not bother with this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2940;As the first round of the archery competition gets underway it becomes apparent that the villagers have a wide range of skills. Some of them are unable to shoot well enough to be able to hit anything close to their target, while others strike true time and time again. My own skills are good enough that I am not yet disqualified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2940;Time for the next round;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2941;The second round of the archery competition involves shooting at targets further away than those during the first round, and most of the villagers are not skilled enough to manage this. By the time that the round is over it is just me and one other archer that are left, and I expect the final round to be quite challenging.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2941;Time for the true test!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2942;The final round of the archery contest takes a long time to conclude, as I and my opponent seem quite close in skill. Eventually I come out ahead as my opponent misses the centre of her target ever so slightly. She does not seem particularly upset, however, and gives me a quick curtsey, proclaiming that I have bested her fairly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2942;Well fought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2943;Though I do my best my skills are not up to the task, and I end up losing the archery competition. The winner, a young woman that apparently has won quite a few contests in the past, is more skilled than nearly every archer I have seen before as far as I can tell, so I suppose it is not too shameful to have lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2943;Time for me to leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2944;As I keep travelling through foreign lands I sometimes find it difficult to find the kind of food that I would be used to. There is often plenty of foreign cuisine to try, however, and it might perhaps be worth trying it out when I have the opportunity instead of insisting on something familiar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2944;I'll try some new things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2944;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2945;I take the next opportunity to try some new kinds of food and quickly realize that it is quite good. I ask someone to bring me more of it, and by the time the meal is over I have eaten quite a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2945;That was a nice meal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2946;I try some new kinds of food when the opportunity arises and find that it tastes rather strange. Initially I think that it probably is due to a lack of familiarity with it, but as I force myself to keep eating I start feeling more and more nauseous, and I end up having to fight to keep what I have eaten down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2946;This was a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2947;One morning when I am riding through yet another village on my way to where I hope to face off against the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] a young man with a sword challenges me to a duel upon noticing my sword. Judging by how he is standing, he is not a very good warrior, so it should be trivial to defeat him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2947;Challenge accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2947;I don't think I'll bother...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2948;As I had predicted my opponent is quite bad, and I easily evade his strikes while testing his defenses. It is a simple enough matter to disarm him once I notice a few flaws in his fighting style, and now that I have beaten my opponent I get to decide what to do with him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2948;I suppose I can compliment him...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2948;I'll salute him and leave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2948;I should mock him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_2948;He deserves no mercy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2949;One day on the road my horse loses one of its shoes, and though it is easy enough for me to get it to the nearest village it turns out the local farrier and his apprentices are sick at the moment, forcing me to remain there for several days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2949;An unfortunate delay...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2950;Though I am confident that I and the rest of the Warriors of the Rising Sun are the greatest warriors in the world and that our way of warfare is quite good it is still useful to consider how a potential enemy might think, and I feel that I have learned some useful things through discreet inquiries during my journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2950;Knowledge is power...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2951;I enter yet another small village on the road towards the location of the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] and find that the villagers do not seem to be getting along very well at the moment. Inquiring about the situation I learn that two prominent families have dragged nearly everyone into an ongoing feud of theirs. The villagers suggest that I could help settle the dispute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2951;I can certainly try!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2951;I don't want any part of this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2952;I meet with representatives from the first family shortly after agreeing to serve as an impartial judge, and they tell me about a number of terrible things that the other family has done. Some things sound rather outlandish, and at times the story is a bit jumbled, making it hard to say what actually might have happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2952;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2952;I suspect I am being lied to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2953;The second family's account of what happened does not match what the first family told me at all. The only real similarities between the two stories is that neither of them seem wholly coherent and that both of them definitely claim that their side is in the right and that the other side is lying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2953;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2953;I suspect I am being lied to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2954;Knowing that I have heard what both sides have to say the villagers are eager to hear my verdict. So far it is not entirely clear to me whether either family's story is the truth, though perhaps it is possible to reach a decision even so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2954;I need more time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2954;The first family is lying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2954;The second family is lying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_2954;Both of them are lying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2955;Though I caught both sides lying to me it still seems prudent to call out the first family alone as I feel that their lies were a bit more substantial. The second family is quick to thank me, and as I would rather not stay around to see what might happen I decide that it is time to leave the village.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2955;I did the right thing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2956;With the second family's story being a rather obvious lie I decide to rule against them. The first family and their supporters are quite pleased, and though I feel that it would be prudent to leave the village quickly I am still confident that I have made a fairly good judgment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2956;It was the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2957;The crowd that is listening to my verdict immediately erups in shouts when I reveal that both families lied to me, and it is not long before the first punch is thrown. Before long the whole village is in chaos, and I decide to leave before someone tries to attack me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2957;They deserve each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2958;I meet with representatives from the first family again to discuss some things that I thought were unclear about their story. To my surprise they admit that perhaps they might have been a bit untruthful and suggest that perhaps some coin would make me ignore this fact and would make me rule against the other family...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2958;I accept your payment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2958;I will not be bribed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2958;I will reveal this dishonesty at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2959;I gather the villagers and declare that I have a verdict to make. The family I just spoke to seems happy at first, but as I publicly reveal that they just attempted to bribe me and that that makes it clear that they are not in the right their grins fade. I decide to leave the village right away to avoid potential retribution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2959;It was the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2960;After being offered a bribe by the first family I am not terribly surprised when the second family also offers a bribe to side with them when I start questioning them about some flaws in their story. It would certainly not be honorable to accept a bribe, but perhaps nobody would find out...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2960;I accept your payment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2960;I will not be bribed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2960;I will reveal this dishonesty at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2961;I gather the villagers after speaking to the second family and declare that I have reached a conclusion due to the fact that bribery was attempted. I can see that both sides look a bit worried, but when I call out the side O just spoke to the other side's mood brightens, and they cheer for me as I take my leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2961;It was the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2962;With both sides having told me stories that do not make sense and having attempted to bribe me it is clear that I will not learn the actual truth, and it is time to make my verdict as the villagers are starting to become impatient and I also need to be on my way soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2962;Side against the first family;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2962;Side against the second family;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2962;Expose both as being dishonorable;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2963;As the bribe the first family offered was larger than the bribe offered by the second family I decide that they are the least honorable family, and I quickly rule against them. Though there are those that would say that I should have ruled against both sides I feel that potentially ending the feud was more important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2963;It was the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2964;The first family is quite displeased to learn that I will not rule in their favor despite the fact that I accepted their bribe, and some of them call me out on this. The second family seems a bit surprised by what just happened as I did not accept their bribe, but they are certainly happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2964;Money can't buy justice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2965;Having accepted a bribe from the second family I declare them to be in the right. The first family is definitely not happy, and I would have earned more money if I had sided with them, but it would perhaps have been more dishonorable to have done so or to have gone back on my agreement with the second family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2965;It was somewhat honorable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2966;Both families are confident that I will rule in their favor when I gather the villagers together once more, seeing as they know that their side has bribed me. The first family's smiles disappear quickly when I declare that they are in the wrong, and some of them go as far as to call me a deal-breaker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2966;Someone had to lose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2967;Though both sides attempted to bribe me and could have been ruled against based on that alone Iu feel that there were more holes in the story the second family told me, and I rule against them based on that. The first family cheers me on as I depart the village, clearly satisfied with my judgment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2967;It was the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2968;As I accepted a bribe from the second family they seem confident that I will declare them in the right, but I quickly make them lose their smiles as I rule against them. The first family seems surprised about what just happened, seeing as I did not accept their bribe, but they are definitely happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2968;Money can't buy justice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2969;Since I accepted a bribe from the first family and turned down the bribe of the second family I feel that I am bound to rule in favor of the first family. It is perhaps not as impartial a judgment as people would have expected, but I did make a deal, and it would be dishonorable to alter it....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2969;It was somewhat honorable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2970;I accepted a bribe from both families, but with the first family paying me more I feel that it is right to take their side. The second family is most unhappy with this development, and several of them accuse me of being a deal-breaker as I prepare to leave the village, which is unsurprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2970;Someone had to lose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2971;Both of the families seeking a verdict from me told inconsistent stories, and both of them attempted to bribe me. The honorable course of action is abundantly clear, and I tell the assembled villagers that both sides are in the wrong. They do not take it well, and start fighting each other even before I can take my leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2971;You deserve each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2972;Having accepted a bribe it would perhaps be reasonable to honor my agreement with the familiy in question, but I decide that it is more honorable to expose both families as being dishonest. The villagers quickly start shouting at each other, and it is not long before someone throws the first punch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2972;I should get going...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2973;Both families have paid me to rule against the other, and both clearly expect to be declared in the right. However, I decide that the most honorable cours of action would be to honor both agreements, and thus I rule against both families. A brawl breaks out as I am leaving the village to continue on my journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2973;Both got what they paid for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2974;One day on the road I come across a man dressed in clothes that probably were the height of fashion once but that now look rather worse for wear. He claims to be a local noble down on his luck, and when he learns of my title he is quite impressed and asks whether I would consider buying a family heirloom of his since he in in dire need of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2974;I will buy your heirloom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2974;Keep your paltry trinket!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2975;The man accepts my payment and hands over the heirloom quickly, even if I definitely sense some reluctance. He wishes me luck on my journey and takes his leave, and I wonder whether he will consider the trade worth it down the line or if he will come to regret selling me his heirloom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2975;I'm sure he'll be fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2976;Though it is doubtful that I would have been asked to prove myself the most skilled warrior in the world if the Warriors of the Rising Sun did not believe in me there might be approaches to fighting that I have never seen before. A skilled foreign warrior offers to teach me a few tricks one day on the road, if I am willing to pay him for his time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2976;This sounds useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2976;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2977;One day on the road the weather takes a turn for the worse, and I soon find myself riding through heavy rain. I reach a village after a short while, and could definitely seek shelter there, but if I stay I might end up delayed noticeably as the roads could get worse, which I might be able to avoid if I keep going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2977;I must press on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2977;It is better to wait a while...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2978;I leave the village behind and press on despite the rain. It is not the most pleasant journey I have had, and the roads keep getting worse as I continue, but eventually the weather clears and the roads start improving again. Given the state of the roads behind me it was probably good that I kept going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2978;I made the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2979;I press on, leaving the village behind me. The downpour gets worse and worse, and my horse struggles to keep its footing from time to time. Though I eventually leave the worst of the downpour behind the roads improve a while after that, I am not sure that it was a good idea to keep going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2979;I feel unwell...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2980;The route I am taking to the location of the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] requires passing through a mountain range, and as I am making my way through the mountain pass I had planned to use I find that the way ahead has been blocked due to a rock slide. It would perhaps be possible to climb over the rocks, but circling back might be safer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2980;I will press on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2980;It would be best to circle back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2981;I dismount and start making my way past the rocks, leading my horse behind me. Though the path is somewhat treacherous I am able to make my way to the other side of the fallen rocks without too much trouble, and the way ahead appears to be free of obstacles as far as I can see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2981;That wasn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2982;I dismount and start making my way past the rocks, leading my horse behind me. The path I take is rather treacherous, with the rocks shifting beneath my feet as I move, and though I eventually make it to the other side I have injured myself a bit due to tripping a few times and failing to catch myself in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2982;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2983;One day on the road I come across a strange party of travellers, nine in total. Stopping briefly to converse with their leader I learn that they too are on a quest, seeking to bring about the end of some "dark lord". To my knowledge there is no such person, but perhaps they know something I do not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2983;Good luck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2983;Beware the Black Riders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2984;One night when I am sleeping at an inn in a small village along the road to the location of the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] I am awakened by the sound of someone moving nearby. Looking out through a crack between the shutters at the window I can see several shadowy figures moving around, likely not planning to conduct any honorable business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2984;Who goes there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2984;I must hide from them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2985;Being on the road without servants and with only a few different outfits has not always made it possible for me to wear the kind of attire that I would consider right and proper back in [Root.Capital.GetName], and at times I wonder whether it actually is worth bothering to make the attempt to look presentable as I keep getting dirty fairly quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2985;Being clean is important!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2985;I should care less...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2986;As I am having an evening meal in the inn of a small and unremarkable village I overhear several of the villagers discussing the subject of poetry. Apparently one of them fancies himself a poet, and the others seem appreciative of his poetry. Perhaps I should take the opportunity to share some poetry of my own poetry?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2986;I will share a poem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2986;I have no interest in this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2987;The villagers are a bit surprised to learn that I am a poet, but they are willing to listen to me recite one of my poems. Once I am finished they express their appreciation of my work, and the villager with poetic aspirations states that it is clear that he could improve, though he does not seem particularly upset.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2987;I knew they'd like that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2988;The villagers are a bit surprised to learn that I am a poet, but they are willing to listen to me recite one of my poems. By the time I am finished it is clear that they regret this decision, and several of them even go as far as suggesting that I should learn from their local poet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2988;They clearly know nothing of poetry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2989;Though my quest to seek out the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] currently is taking up all of my time I have other aspirations as well that I sometimes have not pursued as diligently as I could have. I really should make more of an effort to do so in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2989;Glory will be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2990;The quest to find the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] is taking up all of my time at the moment, and this has forced me to postpone several other plans I have. At first, I was not finding this to my liking, but the journey has made me reconsider whether those goals actually are worth pursuing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2990;I should be content with what I have...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2991;The journey to the location of the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] is taking longer than I initially had expected it to take, and though it at times have been interesting it is starting to become rather tedious. If I do not reach my destination soon, chances are I will need to vent my frustration in some other way than an honorable duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2991;Am I there yet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2992;Being on the road means I no longer have to deal with various matters I would have had to deal with if back home in [Root.Capital.GetName], and I find myself rather enjoying not having to work quite as hard. Perhaps I should take some time away from my work more often...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2992;I should take it easy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2993;As I am travelling by myself I have been forced to interact with all manner of people I normally would not have to interact with in [Root.Capital.GetName], and though I occasionally have been unable to communicate well due to language differences I have gotten better at knowing what to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2993;I'm sure this will be useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2994;One day when I am passing through a village on my way to face the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] I notice that they are holding a local festival of some kind. I take a look around to see just what that entails in this part of the world, and what I find is certainly different from anything I would encounter at a festival back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2994;They truly are uncultured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2994;That was quite interesting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2995;I have seen many wondrous sights on my journey to the location of the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent], but even so I am taken by surprise the day that I see a celestial dragon moving across the sky, its serpentine body gleaming in the sun. Few can claim to have seen such a majestic creature in person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2995;Auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2996;I have heard tales of strange beasts found in foreign lands in the past, but I have usually paid little attention to them as they have sounded rather fanciful. However, when I one day see a large winged creature fly past overhead I am forced to concede that perhaps the tales of fire-breathing dragons are true after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2996;I need to watch the skies...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2997;One day on the road nine figures completely shrouded in black come riding in the opposite direction. They all carry swords at their sides, and something about them puts ne at unease. One of them asks me if I have seen the party of someone named "Shiri", or perhaps "Bagin", who is in possession of something precious their lord lost long ago that he wants back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2997;I can't help you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2997;I might have seen them earlier...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2997;Perhaps you should check in Zeeland?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2998;I have met my fair share of odd people on the road, but one day I encounter a man that is stranger than most, who claims to be a prophet. Speaking in a rather melodramatic fashion, he declares that I need to ready myself to face the onslaught of the "Burning Empire", which apparently is coming to conquer all I hold dear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2998;What an odd man...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2998;He speaks the truth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2998;I am well aware!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_2998;We have already defeated them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2999;Being on the road on a quest for the Warriors of the Rising Sun has made me consider the virtues of the Shinto religion quite a bit, and I have started to wonder if the time perhaps has come to convert to it as I feel that some of its teachings are rather appealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2999;I will convert!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2999;I will convert... secretly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2999;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3000;Being on the road on a quest for the Warriors of the Rising Sun has made me consider the virtues of the Buddhist religion quite a bit, and I have started to wonder if the time perhaps has come to convert to it as I feel that some of its teachings are rather appealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3000;I will convert!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3000;I will convert... secretly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3000;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3001;The Warrios of the Rising Sun are closely tied to Japan, and though foreign warriors sometimes join the society and sometimes rise quite far it is harder to gain the respect of the other members if you are not Japanese, which I am quite aware of. Perhaps the time has come for me to fully embrace Japanese culture...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3001;I should become Japanese!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3001;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3002;There have been times during my voyage to face the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] when I have felt uncertain as to whether embarking on my quest was a good idea, but I am starting to feel more and more certain that I made the right decision and that [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] looks favorably on my quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3002;[Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] is with me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3003;Though things at times have gone well for me I have sometimes felt as if my life lacked purpose, and at times the world has seemed to be against me. However, the journey to face the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] has given me purpose, and I am starting to feel that things perhaps are changing for the better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3003;Life isn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3004;One day when I am having a meal at an inn a foreign woman takes a seat on the opposite side of my table. Introducing herself as a Hermetic scholar somewhat down on her luck, she offers to share some of her supposedly vast knowledge with me in exchange for a rather modest amount of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3004;Tell me what you know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3004;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3005;As I am travelling in foreign lands I have often found myself needing to ask for directions or needing to purchase maps of the areas I have been passing through, and though I doubt that the locals have been trying to mislead me there have been times when I have ended up taking the wrong path due to confusing instructions, such as today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3005;A temporary setback...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3006;As I am travelling in foreign lands I have often found myself needing to ask for directions or needing to purchase maps of the areas I have been passing through, and though I doubt that the locals have been going out of their way to help me they have sometimes let me know about useful shortcuts, such as today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3006;This is going well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3007;As I am passing through a thick forest I spot a group of people dressed in strange clothes standing together and chanting in some unknown language. They do not appear to have spotted me, but whatever they are doing is filling me with unease, and I might perhaps want to intervene before they accomplish whatever they are trying to accomplish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3007;They must be stopped!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3007;This does not concern me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3008;I attack the figures in the forest, cutting several of them down before they even realize I am there. Their attempt to resist is quite feeble, and I easily kill all of those that do not run. When I mention what happened when stopping in a nearby village the villagers are upset, as I apparently interrupted an ordinary religious ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3008;How could I have known?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3009;I attack the figures in the forest, cutting several of them down before they even realize I am there. Their attempt to resist is quite feeble, and I easily kill all of those that do not run. When I mention what happened when stopping in a nearby village the villagers are happy to hear that I stopped the ritual of a secretive local cult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3009;I only did what was right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3010;I attack the figures in the forest, cutting several of them down before they even realize I am there. I take a few minor wounds when they fight back, but I eventually manage to kill all of those that do not run. When I mention what happened to some local villagers they are upset, as I apparently interrupted a perfectly normal religious ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3010;How could I have known?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3011;I attack the figures in the forest, cutting several of them down before they even realize I am there.

EVTOPTA_SOH_3011;I only did what was right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3012;I attack the figures in the forest, cutting several of them down before they even realize I am there. I take a rather grievous wound in the fighting, but in the end I am triumphant. When I mention what happened to some local villagers they are upset, as I apparently interrupted a perfectly normal religious ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3012;How could I have known?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3013;I attack the figures in the forest, cutting several of them down before they even realize I am there. I take a rather grievous wound in the fighting, but in the end I amtriumphant. When I mention what happened to some local villagers they are quite happy to hear that I stopped what apparently was the ritual of a secretive local cult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3013;I only did what was right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3014;I attack the figures in the forest, cutting several of them down before they even realize I am there. However, they recover from their shock more quickly than I had anticipated, and I soon find myself surrounded. Though I fight to the best of my ability I am eventually overcome, and I fall to the ground, my vision fading...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3014;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3015;One day I notice a rather curious sight next the road I am travelling on. A fairly large bounder is standing all by itself, and a sword appears to somehow have been jammed into it, with little but the hilt visible. Looking more closely at it, I cannot really see how the sword ever ended up there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3015;I wonder if I can pull it free...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3015;I should keep going...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3016;I reach out and grab the hilt of the sword easily enough, attempting to pull it free with all of my strength. It does not appear to move at all, and despite making several more attempts I am unable to pull the sword free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3016;How odd...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3017;I reach out and grab the hilt of the sword easily enough, and I only need to make a token effort to pull it free. The blade is quite old, and I notice that the edge most definitely has become dull. It would not be useful as a weapon, and it is certainly not interesting enough to take with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3017;I should put this back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3018;I have come across a number of abandoned ruins and strange structures during my journey, and in the past I have not paid much attention to them. However, today I came across a rather larger stone circle, and I started to wonder if it perhaps would be worth investigating it more closely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3018;I will investigate it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3018;It would be a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3019;The stone circle is clearly something of human origin, and it has clearly not been used for quite some time as it is mostly overgrown. Taking a look around, I do not spot anything obvious that would let me guess as to its original purpose, and even when I decide to remove some of the moss I can find nothing of interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3019;That was a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3020;The stone circle is clearly something of human origin, and it has clearly not been used for quite some time as it is mostly overgrown. Taking a look around, I do not spot anything obvious that would let me guess as to its original purpose. When I remove some of the moss from one of the stones I manage find a depiction of two warriors engaged in a duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3020;Interesing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3021;One day I enter a village and overhear a herald proclaiming that there is a reward to be gained by the man or woman who can bring the head of a local bandit chief to the captain of the guard. Inquiring further, I learn that this bandit chief and his band of bandits has been causing the region a lot of trouble recently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3021;I will hunt him down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3021;I have better things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3022;I spend several days searching for the bandits that supposedly are hidden near the village, but I do not manage to find any sign of them. Perhaps they have moved on to another area, seeing as they are being actively hunted, or perhaps they are exceptionally good at hiding. Whatever the truth is, I cannot afford to keep looking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3022;I did my best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3023;By pure chance I stumble upon the bandits' trail easily enough, and I have no trouble at all following the trail to their encampment. As best I can tell, they are making preparations to depart, so if I do not choose to fight them it is very likely that they will slip away before anyone else can find them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3023;I will attack them right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3023;This is someone else's problem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3024;Confident in their ability to hide the bandits have not even posted sentries, and I am among them before they notice my presence. Several of them fall before they can pull their weapons free, and not even their chief puts up much a fight. It is a simple enough matter to behead the man and disperse his followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3024;That was easy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3025;The bandits have not seen fit to post sentries, but even so some of them spot me before I can get close to them, and they ready their weapons to fight me. The fighting is fierce, and I take a number of wounds during the battle, but eventually I manage to disperse them after beheading their leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3025;They fought well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3026;The bandits' sentries spot me as I make my approach, and I quickly find myself having to fight to move any further. I take a number of wounds in the fighting, and the fight initially does not seem to go my way. Eventually, I manage to kill the bandit chief, and the rest of them slip away. Pursuing them would be foolish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3026;That was far too close...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3027;I move towards the centre of the bandits' encampment, readying my weapon. Though it appears as if I have not been noticed at first I discover that I am mistaken when a volley of arrows suddenly comes at me. Several of them hit their mark, and the bandits waste no time closing in for the kill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3027;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3028;One day I notice that someone has carved something into the wall of a cliff just to the side of the road. Investigating the carvings I realize that it is a depiction of a number of strangely dressed warriors fighting duels with one another, and though some liberties clearly have been taken there are at least a couple of useful things depicted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3028;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3029;Being on the road with only a handful of possessions on me has made me consider whether I actually need everything I have back home even when I am there. Though there are things that I own that definitely are useful, I have perhaps been a bit too greedy in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3029;I don't need money to be happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3030;There are times when I feel that there has been far too many things that I have been expected to do as both a ruler and a warrior, and though some of them might have been rather important it has been exhausting to have to deal with all of those things. Now that I have been on the road for a while I have finally been able to relax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3030;This journey was good for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3031;At the Edge of the Dunes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3031;It has been a long journey, but I have finally arrived at the supposed location of the Sword of the Shifting Sands. Situated at the very edge of the Sahara Desert, the merchant city I have arrived at is larger than I had expected, and the people seem friendly enough despite the fact that I am an outsider.\n\nAsking the guards at the gate about the Sword of the Shifting Sands, I learn that the locals believe that the Sword can be found in one of the nearby oases, and that there likely are people in the city that would be able to guide me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3031;I should check in the bazaar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3032;I start asking the merchants in the bazaar whether they know how to get to the oasis of the Sword of the Shifting Sands. The first dozen or so claim that they have no idea, but eventually I find a cartographer who has a map of the area and who would be willing to mark the oasis for me, though the price he sets for the map is rather steep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3032;I'll buy your map!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3032;I'll get back to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3033;A couple of days after speaking to the cartographer I am approached by a young boy dressed in clothes similar to those worn by various desert tribesmen I have seen. He says that he knows that I seek the Sword of the Shifting Sands due to overhearing some gossip about me, and offers to guide me for a small sum of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3033;You're hired!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3033;I'll get back to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3034;As I continue asking around in the city I learn of an old man that supposedly has guided caravans through the desert for nearly sixty years. It is easy enough for me to find him in a house nearby, and when I ask about the oasis of the Sword of the Shifting Sands he offers his services as a guide in exchange for a modest amount of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3034;You seem competent enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3034;I'll get back to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3035;As I am taking a break from my search at a local inn a young woman with her face partially obscured by a veil sits down at my table without promting. She tells me that she is familiar with the oasis I seek, having been there before, and that she is on her way there, and offers to take me there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3035;I will accompany you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3035;I'll get back to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3036;I spend some more time asking around to see whether there are other options available, but after spending a few days without discovering any new leads I am forced to conculde that there is no other option than those I have discovered already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3036;I'll buy the map;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3036;I'll hire the boy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3036;I'll go with the old man;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3036;I'll accompany the woman;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3037;I leave the city the next morning, with the map I have purchased in my hand and plenty of extra water. Unless the map I purchased is incorrect it should be possible for me to travel from oasis to oasis until I reach my destination, and it should not take overly long to make this journey unless something unexpected happens along the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3037;This should be easy enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3039;The Sword of the Shifting Sands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_3039;I arrive at the oasis of the Sword of the Shifting Sands and discover that it is quite a bit larger than I had expected. Noticing that an ornately decorated stone building next to the water is the only sign of human habitation present I head there and enter through the surprising large gateway leading inside.\n\nInside the building I find the veiled woman I met at the inn waiting for me with a thin, curved sword in her hand and a small smile on her lips.\n\n"I was starting to wonder if I had gotten lost," she tells me. "I know why you are here, but custom dictates I tell me, even so.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_3039;I arrive at the oasis of the Sword of the Shifting Sands and discover that it is quite a bit larger than I had expected. Noticing that an ornately decorated stone building next to the water is the only sign of human habitation present I head there and enter through the surprising large gateway leading inside.\n\nInside the building I find a young woman waiting for me with a thin, curved sword in her hand and a small smile on her lips.\n\n"It seems I have a guest," she notes. "Tell me, why have you come here? Why have you sought out the Sword of the Shifting Sands?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3039;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3040;I and the young boy I hired agree to set off to the oasis of the Sword of the Shifting Sands in the morning, and I spend the rest of the day making preparations for the journey. The boy is waiting for me when I leave my room at the inn I have been staying at the next morning, seemingly impatient to depart from the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3040;He seems eager to please...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3041;I and my young guide have been on our way for several days and are heading through a ravine when an arrow comes flying past my head. Looking around, I notice that several armed men have appeared in every direction, and that the boy who hs guided me so far is nowhere to be found. It is not hard to figure out why that is the case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3041;He led me into an ambush!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3042;With the element of surprise lost, the bandits are no match for me, and most of them die before the survivours conclude that they need to flee. I see no reason to waste time riding them down, but now that I no longer have a guide I need to decide whether to try to get to the oasis on my own or to fall back to the city for directions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3042;I can find the way on my own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3042;I need directions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3043;The bandits fight hard and manage to wound me during the fighting, but the fight turns in my favor after a while and the survivours conclude that they need to flee. I see no reason to waste time riding them down, but now that I no longer have a guide I need to decide whether to try to get to the oasis on my own or to fall back to the city for directions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3043;I can find the way on my own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3043;I need directions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3044;The bandits fight hard, and I take a grievious wound in the fighting, but eventually the fight starts going my way and the remaining bandits turn around and flee. I see no reason to waste time riding them down, but now that I no longer have a guide I need to decide whether to try to get to the oasis on my own or to fall back to the city for directions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3044;I can find the way on my own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3044;I need directions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3045;I fight hard, and several bandits fall before me, but they qickly manage to inflict several wounds of their own and show no sign of being unwilling to continue fighting. It takes a while before it becomes clear which way the battle is going, but eventually it is clear that I will not be victorious, and I soon take a fatal wound...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3045;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3046;Leaving the site of the bandit ambush behind I depart in the direction of what seems to be an oasis, only to discover that it is nothing but a mirage. Concluding that I am lost, I decide to fall back, but after a while I find that my tracks have disappeared thanks to the wind, and with little water left there can only be one outcome...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3046;And so it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3048;The Sword of the Shifting Sands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_3048;I arrive at the oasis of the Sword of the Shifting Sands and discover that it is quite a bit larger than I had expected. Noticing that an ornately decorated stone building next to the water is the only sign of human habitation present I head there and enter through the surprising large gateway leading inside.\n\nInside the building I find the veiled woman I met at the inn waiting for me with a thin, curved sword in her hand and a small smile on her lips.\n\n"I was starting to wonder if I had gotten lost," she tells me. "I know why you are here, but custom dictates I tell me, even so.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_3048;I arrive at the oasis of the Sword of the Shifting Sands and discover that it is quite a bit larger than I had expected. Noticing that an ornately decorated stone building next to the water is the only sign of human habitation present I head there and enter through the surprising large gateway leading inside.\n\nInside the building I find a young woman waiting for me with a thin, curved sword in her hand and a small smile on her lips.\n\n"It seems I have a guest," she notes. "Tell me, why have you come here? Why have you sought out the Sword of the Shifting Sands?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3048;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3049;I and the old man agree to depart the next morning, and he gives me a list of preparations I should make, such as making sure I can carry a good amount of water with me. By the time that I get to the old man's house the next morning I am having a good feeling about the journey ahead, and he also seems ot be in a good mood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3049;Lead on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3050;One day when I and the old man are riding through the desert he suddenly cluches his chest and falls off his horse. Though he lands relatively gently in a sand dune I discover that his heart is not beating and that his breathing has stopped. It seems his age finally has caught up to him, and as a consequence of this I no longer have a guide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3050;I can find the way on my own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3050;I need directions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3051;Leaving the old man's body behind I continue in the direction we were going, confident that I will be able to find the oasis I seek on your own. However, the arrival of a sandstorm  a few days later makes me lose my sense of direction, and I am unable to find either a source of water or the way back to the city I departed from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3051;And so it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3053;The Sword of the Shifting Sands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_3053;I arrive at the oasis of the Sword of the Shifting Sands and discover that it is quite a bit larger than I had expected. Noticing that an ornately decorated stone building next to the water is the only sign of human habitation present I head there and enter through the surprising large gateway leading inside.\n\nInside the building I find the veiled woman I met at the inn waiting for me with a thin, curved sword in her hand and a small smile on her lips.\n\n"I was starting to wonder if I had gotten lost," she tells me.

"Tell me, why have you come here? Why have you sought out the Sword of the Shifting Sands?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3053;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3054;Having returned to the city at the edge of the desert I find that there is nobody there that would be willing or able to guide me to my destination. The cartographer I spoke to earlier is however still willing to sell me the map that he offered me before for the same price he asked previously, so it seems as if there still is one option left.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3054;I guess I'll go with the map...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3054;I'd rather go home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3055;The young woman smiles slightly when I accept her offer to take me to the location of the Sword of the Shifting Sands and suggests that I should make sure that I get a good night's sleep and that I bring a lot of water. She asks me to meet her at the inn early the next morning, as she has some errands she needs to run before then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3055;I wonder why she seeks the oasis...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3056;As I and the veiled woman are making camp for the night in a smaller oasis on the way to the one where the Sword of the Shifting Sands supposedly can be found she suddenly leans in closely and plants a kiss on my lips, suggesting that perhaps the two of us could do something else during the rest of the evening than just engage in small talk over dinner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3056;I like the way you think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3056;I'd rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3056;I'm not really interested...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3057;I and my guide spend a rather enjoyable evening in one another's arms, with only a brief interruption to eat, and fall asleep together quite late, exhausted. Though I am a bit reluctant to get underway in the morning, we cannot stay where we are forever, and I have a quest to complete for the Warriors of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3057;We must press on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3058;My companion takes the rejection well enough, and though I half expected things to get a bit strained between the two of us due to what happened our conversation over dinner is pleasant enough, and the same can be said for the one we have over breakfast the next morning. Maybe I have nothing to worry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3058;Let's just keep moving...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3060;The Sword of the Shifting Sands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3060;I and the veiled woman arrive at the oasis that supposedly is the home of the Sword of the Shifting Sands, and she guides me to an ornately decorated stone building at one side of the surprisingly large pool of water in the oasis.\n\nOnce inside, she disappears off to one side briefly and returns with a thin, curved sword in her hand.\n\n"It has been a while since someone came to seek me out," she tells me. "We both know why you are here, but I believe that it is customary for the guest to inform the host why they have come, so please take care of the formalities.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3060;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3062;I and the Sword of the Shifting Sands begin our duel by probing each other's defenses carefully, and my initial impression of her capabilities is that she knows what she is doing. It takes quite a while before the outcome starts to become apparent, but eventually I disarm her, and she declares that she yields.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3062;Well fought, and farewell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3062;You should join my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3062;And now you die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3063;I and the Sword of the Shifting Sands begin our duel by probing each other's defenses carefully, and my initial impression of her capabilities is that she knows what she is doing. Though it takes quite a while before the outcome is clear she eventually gains the upper hand, and eventually she puts the tip of her sword at my throat and asks me if I yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3063;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3063;I'd rather die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3064;Under the Sign of the Cross;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3064;I have arrived in the small town where the Sword of Christ supposedly has been seen in the past. It is rather unremarkable, in my opinion, and the only really notable thing about the town is a small abbey that is the home of an order of monks.\n\nI question a few of the locals about the Sword of Christ when I arrive, but they claim that they cannot help me as the man only has visited the village infrequently in the past and his current location is uncertain. Hopefully, someone in the town is more informed than the average person, as it otherwise will be impossible to find the man I seek.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3064;Time to ask around...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3065;I spend some time asking around and am directed to speak to a man who apparently is a famous herald. He tells me that he believes he could track down the Sword of Christ for me relatively easily as he is known by many influential people nearby and thus could get answers I might not be able to get, but that his services are in high demand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3065;Name your price!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3065;Maybe later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3066;Telling the herald that I will see if there are other offers before hiring him I keep looking around the village for anyone that could help me out. To my surprise, a local child approaches me and suggests that perhaps the monks in the abbey know how to reach the Sword of Christ, seeing as he his a champion of Christianity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3066;I will speak to these monks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3066;Maybe later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3067;I keep walking through the streets of the town looking for other options. Towards the edge of the town furthest away from the abbey I notice that a building I had thought was an inn actually has a rather suggestive sign, and I conclude that it probably is a brothel. Though the Sword of Christ is unlikely to visit it, the prostitutes might have information.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3067;I can ask here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3067;Maybe later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3068;After going through the town one more time in the hopes of finding some other way to determine the location of the Sword of Christ I have concluded that there are no further options. I need to decide between the options I am aware of as I cannot afford to delay any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3068;I will hire the herald!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3068;I will ask the monks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3068;I will ask at the brothel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3069;I hire the famous herald and he immeidately readies his horse to set off. A few of the locals are nearby and notice what is going on, and they tell me that the man probably is one of the most honorable people to be found nearby, so it seems unlikely that he is planning to ride off with my money without doing what he was hired to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3069;I hope he returns quickly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3071;The monks at the abbey are quite pleased to meet me and have evidently heard of me as they bring up the subject of the Sword of Christ before I can get around to it. They immediately offer to send one of their number to find the man in question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3071;I knew they'd help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3072;The monks at the abbey are willing to speak with me despite the fact that I am not a Christian, but when I tell them that I seek the Sword of Christ they inform me that they are unwilling to send a message to him in the name of a heathen. They demand that I convert to Christianity if I wish for them to help me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3072;If I must...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3072;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3073;The monks are unhappy to learn that I am unwilling to convert, and they refuse to help me. As word likely will spread that the monks are upset with me, I will probably have to act quickly if I wish to find the Sword of Christ, and that means I will have to hire the herald despite it being rather expensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3073;I guess the herald will do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3073;I'd rather go home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3074;The owner of the brothel claims that she does not know anything about the Sword of Christ but that one of the prostitutes working there might know. She also tells me that she has a business to run, and that I will have to pay for the company of the prostitute in question even if I only want to ask her a question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3074;I suppose that's reasonable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3074;I'll look elsewhere...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3075;I pay the necessary gold to hire the prostitute that the brothel's owner claims might know the answer to my question, and I am directed to one of the rooms at the brothel. Inside I find a young woman waiting for me, who starts undressing almost as soon as I enter the room, evidently not expecting me to be there for any unusual reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3075;I'm just here to ask a question!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3075;I can ask my question later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3076;The prostitute is surprised to learn that I merely want to know the location of the Sword of Christ, but she does not seem particularly unhappy by this. She tells me she is reasonably certain that she knows where the man in question can be found, and offers to send one of the maids to find him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3076;She'd better hurry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3077;The prostitute is surprised to learn that I merely want to know the location of the Sword of Christ. She does not seem particularly unhappy by this, but she does not possess the information I seek. Given that I likely was seen entering the brothel the monks at the abbey are unlikely to be willing to help me, leaving me with just one option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3077;I guess the herald will do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3077;I'd rather go home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3078;I ask the prostitute about the Sword of Christ after sleeping with her, and though she seems rather surprised by the question she informs me that she is reasonably certain where he is. She offers to send one of the maids to find the man, and that seems like a reasonable idea to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3078;She'd better hurry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3079;I ask the prostitute about the Sword of Christ after sleeping with her, and she tells me that she does not know of the man. Given that it is very likely that I have been seen at the brothel I doubt that the monks at the abbey would be willing to help me any longer, so if I want to find the man I seek I will have to hire the herald.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3079;I guess the herald will do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3079;I'd rather go home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3080;Some days after my visit to the brothel I start to notice some discomfort when sitting down, and when I find a secluded place to undress I notice the signs of what I suspect is some kind of disease I must have picked up at the brothel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3080;That's not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3081;The Sword of Christ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3081;A few days after word was sent to the Sword of Christ one of the villagers comes running to fetch me, saying that the man in question has been sighted. I am led to one edge of the village and can see a man wearing an ornate suit of armor that is decorated with a multitude of crosses riding towards the village on a white stallion.\n\n"I assume it is you that requested my presence, my [Root.GetLordLady]," he says as he comes to a halt near me. "I suspect I know why you have come, but I would like to hear you say it even so.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3081;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3083;I and the Sword of Christ face off against each other in front of a large audience. Testing his defenses, I quickly determine that he will not be easily defeated. The duel remains undecided for quite some time, but I finally manage to get past his blade and put the tip of my sword at his throat, forcing him to yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3083;Well fought, and farewell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3083;You should join my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3083;And now you die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3084;I and the Sword of Christ face off against each other in front of a large audience. Testing his defenses, I quickly determine that he will not be easily defeated. The duel remains undecided for quite some time, but then it goes against me very suddenly and I find myself disarmed, with my opponent asking if I will yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3084;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3084;I'd rather die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3085;A Land of Runes and Raiders;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3085;I have finally arrived at the location where the Sword of Winter supposedly can be found. Though I know that there are Warriors of the Rising Sun that would use the word lightly the people in this inhospitable part of the world definitely are savages, and it is a bit strange that a warrior that supposedly is one of the best in the world can be found here.\n\nThe locals have expressed an interest in why I am here, but so far I have not found my opponent, and the only information I have obrained so far is that I am looking for an older woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3085;I just need to ask around a bit more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3086;It took me several days to find someone that knows where the Sword of Winter can be found, as she apparently is somewhat reclusive, but eventually a young warrior offered to guide me to her, telling me that she can be found in a place known as the Hall of Winter, which supposedly is located deep in the nearby forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3086;How quaint...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3088;In the Hall of Winter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3088;After travelling for several days in the company of my guide I arrive at a large longhouse deep in the forest. Two fierce-looking warriors stand guard at the entrance, but neither of them moves to stop me from entering.\n\nInside, I find a number of warriors seated around a long table upon which a large feast has been laid out. At the far end there is an ornately carved throne, upon which a fairly old woman is seated.\n\n"Ah, a challenger," she says when she notices me. "Since you so rudely have interrupted us in the middle of our meal, I request that you face off against some of my warriors before the two of us fight.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3088;I will take them all on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3088;I'm here for you, not for them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3089;The Sword of Winter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3089;The woman's expression sours as I refuse to fight her warrior, but she stands up and draws her sword.\n\n"A most rude guest indeed," she proclaims. "If not for the promise I made to the man who trained me, I would refuse your challenge."\n\nShe walks over to an open area to one side of the table while the others present motion for me to join her, with those that were seated on that side of the table moving elsewhere to get a better view of the duel that is about to begin.\n\n"Shall we begin?" the woman asks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3089;Let's fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3090;I have barely had time to agree to the Sword of Winter's request before the closest warriors are upon me, their weapons drawn. Though their assault is fierce, they are no match for someone as skilled as I am. The Sword of Winter watches with interest, but she does not seem overly concerned about her own chances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3090;Was that all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3091;U have barely had time to agree to the Sword of Winter's request before the closest warriors are upon me, their weapons drawn. Though their assault is fierce, and I am wounded in the fighting, but eventually I prevail. The Sword of Winter watches with interest, but she does not seem overly concerned about her own chances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3091;Time for the true fight...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3092;I have barely had time to agree to the Sword of Winter's request before the closest warriors are upon me, their weapons drawn. Their assault is fierce, and I take a grievious wound in the fighting, but eventually I prevail. The Sword of Winter watches with interest, and she does not seem overly concerned about her own chances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3092;This went rather poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3093;I have barely had time to agree to the Sword of Winter's request before the closest warriors are upon me, and they quickly overwhelm me.\n\n"It seems we shall not duel today," the Sword of Winter says as my vision fades. "I look forward to meeting you in Valhalla.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3093;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3094;The Sword of Winter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3094;"So, you are a good warrior after all," the Sword of Winter notes as she stands up, drawing her sword. "You managed to send all of my warriors to Valhalla despite being outnumbered, which definitely has earned you the honor of fighting me."\n\nShe moves over to an open area to one side of the now abandoned table, motioning for me to join her there.\n\n"It seems the Allfather himself will hear of this," the woman says, looking over at a pair of ravens that apparently have seen fit to perch to one side. "Ready yourself, and we shall see which one of us truly is the better warrior!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3094;Enough talk!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3096;Despite her age, the Sword of Winter turns out to still be a formidable warrior, and I do not notice any obvious weaknesses I could take advantage of at first. The two of us exchange blows for some time , but eventually I manage to disarm her. The Sword of Winter immediately yields when this happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3096;Well fought, and farewell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3096;You should join my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3096;And now you die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3097;Despite her age, the Sword of Winter turns out to still be a formidable warrior, and I do not notice any obvious weaknesses I could take advantage of. The two of us exchange blows for some time before the fight eventually goes against me and she manages to disarm me. She tells me that she wil spare my life if I yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3097;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3097;I'd rather die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3098;The Empty Expanse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3098;I have finally arrive at what should be the location where the Sword of the Steppes can be found, and it is only now that I have noticed a problem that should have been apparent sooner, namely that the lack of any permanent settlements in this region means that my opponent is nowhere to be found, and neither is anyone else.\n\nAs best I can tell, there is no obvious clue as to where the Sword of the Steppes or anyone that might know where he can be found, and I doubt that falling back to the last town I visited would be an option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3098;What do I do now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3099;Several days have passed since I started looking for signs of nearby nomads, and at last I have spotted a rider in the distance. They seem to be approaching, though whether this rider has any particular interest in me or merely is curious is hard to say. As I have not found anyone else to ask about the Sword of the Steppes I might as well speak to the rider.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3099;I doubt it'll hurt my chances...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3100;To my surprise the rider asks for me by name once he is close enough to be heard. As soon as I confirm that he has found me he reveals that he has been sent to find me as the Sword of the Steppes has heard of my quest and has asked for me to be brought to him as quickly as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3100;Lead on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3102;The Sword of the Steppes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3102;My guide leads me to a large nomad encampment where the sentries let me pass without comment. I am quickly taken to the center of the encampment where a large number of warriors have gathered in a half-circle facing a fairly young man, who turns to look at me as I draw near.\n\n"I was wondering how soon you would arrive," the young man says, slowly drawing his sword. "It has been a long time since one of the Warriors of the Rising Sun came to visit us, and it certainly is an honor. We both know why you are here, of course, but I still ask that you state it clearly.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3102;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3104;I draw my sword and move to engage the Sword of the Steppes, only having time to take a few steps before the man reaches me, driving me back several steps as he unleashes a flurry of blows. Though it hard to gain the upper hand I eventually manage to find an opening in his defenses, and I put the tip of my sword at his throat, forcing him to yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3104;Well fought, and farewell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3104;You should join my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3104;And now you die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3105;I draw my sword and move to engage the Sword of the Steppes, only having time to take a few steps before the man reaches me, driving me back several steps as he unleashes a flurry of blows. I manage to deflect several of them, but eventually the man's sword slips past my defenses, with the tip coming to rest at my throat. The man asks if I will yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3105;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3105;I'd rather die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3106;A Matter of Bureaucracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3106;I have arrived at the supposed location of the Sword of the Dragon, which apparently is one of the largest cities I have ever seen, and I am hardly the only one that wishes to enter the city considering the long line at the gate.\n\nWhen it finally is my turn to enter the guards at the gate inquire as to why I have come, and when they hear that I seek the Sword of the Dragon they inform me that those that seek the man need to speak to one of the local government officials in one of the buildings overlooking the central market of the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3106;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3107;I arrive at the building the guards told me to go to and quickly manage to arrange a meeting with the man who supposedly is in charge of matters concerning the Sword of the Dragon. He informs me that many seek the Sword of the Dragon and that only someone that passes a written test gets to meet the Sword... unless the officials get paid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3107;I'll pay you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3107;I'll take the test!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3108;Despite the fact that the man asks for quite a lot of money I am unwilling to waste time on a test that apparently has nothing to do with fighting, so I agree to pay him to avoid it. Doubtlessly there are those among the Warriors of the Rising Sun who will be displeased by this, but I still think I have made the right decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3108;I'm sure people will understand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3110;The first part of the test I have to take consists of making a written statement explaining in detail why I deserve to face off against an opponent as auspicious as the Sword of the Dragon. I would have thought that my reputation would have preceded me, but apparently it is insufficient to convince the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3110;I think my statement was good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3111;The second part of the test consists of a number of questions regarding the Art of War, some of them trivially easy, others quite challenging. As I have discussed warfare with others in the past I am not entirely unprepared, and I feel like my answers might be good enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3111;I think I got it right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3112;The third part of the test appears to have nothing to do with the Sword of the Dragon, warfare, or other matters that could be relevant, since it asks a number of questions regarding how a ruler should govern their realm. I ask the man that handed it to me whether I got the wrong test, but he assures me it is the right one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3112;This was a rather odd test...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3113;The fourth part of the test contains a number of riddles, which is a rather odd subject as far as I am concerned, but seeing as the previous test also was rather unrelated to the matter at hand I am not entirely surprised. Several of the riddles are rather tricky, but I eventually arrive at decent answers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3113;This was rather tricky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3114;The fifth and final part of the test is a number of questions regarding notable Chinese works. As with the previous two tests it does not seem particularly relevant, but I am assured that this indeed is the test I should be taking, and I eventually manage to answer all of the questions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3114;I hope I get the results soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3116;The official I spoke to first meets with me again a few days after I took the test, informing me that my answers have been deemed acceptable and that a messenger has been sent to the Sword of the Dragon, who apparently is elsewhere at the moment. I am offered a room to stay in until your opponent arrives, which I see no reason to refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3116;I hope he arrives soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3117;The official I spoke to first meets with me again a few days after I took the test, informing me that my answers were not good enough to warrant a duel with the Sword of the Dragon. I will either have to pay for the duel to be arranged or have to leave without issuing my challenge, which would mean failing my quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3117;I guess I have to pay...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3117;I'd rather go home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3118;The Sword of the Dragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3118;Several days after the messenger was sent I receive word that the Sword of the Dragon is on his way to the city but that the journey still will take him several more days. A few days later, I am asked to accompany the local bureaucrats outside to meet the man.\n\nAs I exit the building where I have been staying I can see a large column of soldiers approaching the front steps, led by a single rider on a fine horse. He raises a hand to bring the soldiers to a halt and dismounts, walking over to me.\n\n"I suspect that it is you that have summoned me," he says. "Tell me, what do you want?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3118;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3120;Though the Sword of the Dragon arrived accompanied by a large number of soldiers I did not initially expect him to be a good warrior, but he turns out to be a skilled opponent. However, though he fights well he is not good enough to defeat me, and I eventually manage to disarm him, forcing him to yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3120;Well fought, and farewell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3120;You should join my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3120;And now you die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3121;Though the Sword of the Dragon arrived accompanied by a large number of soldiers I did not initially expect him to be a good warrior, but he turns out to be a skilled opponent. I think I might be able to prevail at first, but eventually he manages to disarm me, upon which he asks me if I will yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3121;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3121;I'd rather die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3122;A Land of Many Gods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3122;The location I was told to head to in order to find the Sword of Serpents is deep in the jungles of India, which seems like a rather strange place for a renowned warrior to be located, but based on the information I have managed to obtain along the way the man is indeed found somewhere in the jungle, and he is supposedly some kind of madman in addition to being a skilled warrior.\n\nUpon arriving at the location I have been told to go to I find that there is nothing there except for a rather small village, which is strange since I have heard that the Sword of Serpents' home is quite grand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3122;I hope I'm not in the wrong place...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3123;After speaking to the villagers I am given directions to the true location of the Sword of Serpents, which apparently is an ancient temple deeper into the jungle. The villagers tell me that they do not really understand why anyone would want to live there, but as I have heard that I seek a madman it does not surprise me overly much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3123;I suppose I will head there...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3125;In the Heart of the Jungle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3125;The journey through the jungle to the old temple where the Sword of Serpents supposedly can be found is rather difficult, and it takes me several days to get to my destination, which turns out to be a bit grander than I had expected it to be.\n\n"Welcome!" a voice calls out from one of the upper levels, where I can see a man standing on a balcony. "You must be here to fight me!" He laughs a bit before continuing. "You will have to pass through the challenges inside to reach me!"\n\nWith that, he disappears inside, letting out yet another laugh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3125;Let's see what is inside...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3126;The first few rooms inside are empty, and I start to wonder if there truly are challenges as pass go through them. However, as I reach the base of a large stairway IU notice that what I initially thought was a bunch of vines covering the stairs instead is a number of hooded snakes, which doubtless are not going to be friendly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3126;I can get past them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3126;I can't risk this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3127;I start making my way up the stairs, moving as carefully as I can between the snakes. Unfortunately I am not careful enough, and the snakes soon make their displeasure known. Though I attempt to fend them off with my sword, several of them still manage to bite me, and I collapse to the ground, my vision darkening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3127;And so it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3128;I start making my way up the stairs, moving as carefully as I can between the snakes. Though they do not seem entirely pleased to have someone move past them they do not attack me, and eventually I manage to reach the top of the stairs, entering a snake-free passage leading elsewhere in the temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3128;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3129;I pass through several more empty rooms before reaching the next set of stairs. At first it looks as if there is nothing special to be found there, but when I accidentally kick a small rock over towards the base of the stairs a small section of the floor drops down and an arrow flies past me. Evidently the room is trapped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3129;I can do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3129;This is too dangerous...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3130;I study the floor and the stairs carefully before moving, taking note of anything that looks like a pressure plate. Though I get quite far without a misstep IU eventually make a mistake, and an arrow hits me in the shoulder. It has evidently been posioned, seeing as the strength leaves my body very quickly, and as I fall I trigger several more traps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3130;NOOOOO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3131;I study the floor and the stairs carefully before moving, taking note of anything that looks like a pressure plate. Several of them are hard to make out, and I almost step in the wrong place a number of times, but I successfully make my way across the room and up the stairs, and the room above is free from traps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3131;Next challenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3132;As I continue through the temple I notice that there no longer appears to be just one way forward, and I start to suspect that I have entered a labyrinth. Given the sheer size of the temple, it is likely very extensive, and if I got lost it is not certain that I would be able to find the exit again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3132;I can do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3132;This is too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3133;I begin making my way through the labyrinth, doing my best to remember which way I turn at each intersection. The temple is large enough that it takes me several hours before I conclude that I am lost, and though I try to find my way out of the labyrinth again I do not manage to do so, and the hours soon turn to days...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3133;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3134;I begin making my way through the labyrinth, doing my best to remember which way I turn at each intersection. Just as I start wondering whether I have gotten lost I find myself at the base of a grand staircase, and at the top of it I can see a pair of ornately decorated doors, which likely lead to where my opponent waits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3134;That wasn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3135;The Sword of Serpents;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3135;I push the ornate doors open and go through the doorway, finding myself in a large chamber containing a number of large statues of men and women clad in elaborate clothing of unknown significance. I can see the Sword of Serpents sitting with his legs crossed towards the opposite side of the room, and he looks up expectantly as I draw closer.\n\n"You're here!" the madman exclaims, jumping to his feet. "People said that it was a stupid idea to add the snakes, and the pressure plates, and the labyrinth, but I knew I was right!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3135;Time to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3137;Despite the fact that the Sword of Serpents is something of a madman, he clearly knows how to fight, and his style incorporates a large number of feints. However, eventually I manage to make out a pattern, and I beat his sword aside with mine and put the tip of my sword at his throat. The Sword of Serpents immediately yields.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3137;Well fought, and farewell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3137;You should join my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3137;And now you die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3138;Despite the fact that the Sword of Serpents is something of a madman, he clearly knows how to fight, and his style incorporates a large number of feints. I manage to fend him off for a while, but eventually he gets through my defenses, and I find myself with the tip of his sword at my throat. He asks if I wish to yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3138;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3138;I'd rather die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3139;I have finally returned home from my journey to seek out one of the greatest warriors in the world. Perhaps I will find reason to journey somewhere else in the future, but right now I really should investigate whether there are things at home that require my attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3139;Home, sweet home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3140;A Challenge at Home;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3140;One uneventful day one of my servants comes running, telling me that an old man has arrived and is requesting to meet me. I decide to grant the man an audience, and when he enters I notice that he is armed and definitely walks as if he knows how to fight.\n\n"At last we meet," the man says, inclining his head slightly. "You have travelled across the land, searching far and wide, and have defeated all six of my most promising students. You certainly show promise, but if you wish to prove that you truly are the very best warrior in the world you must face me now, in a duel to the death.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3140;Challenge accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3140;I would rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3142;The Undisputed Champion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3142;I and the Unknown Master draw our swords as a crowd gathers nearby. I slowly move closer, and my opponent does likewise, each of us studying each other's moves carefully. We both make careful probing attacks, and both of us deal with them easily enough, neither giving anything away. It is clear that the duel will not be decided quickly.\n\nI am pressed to my limits by my opponent, but eventually the duel starts going my way, and I inflict a number of small wounds on my opponent before finally beheading him with one swift strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3142;I am the very best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3143;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName] finally has managed to prove [From.GetHerselfHimself] the very best warrior in all the world, defeating seven skilled opponents in the process. It is doubtful that anyone else will be given the opportunity to do something similar while [From.GetBestName] still lives, so the achievement is unlikely to be matched anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3143;Impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3144;A Final and Fatal Defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3144;I and the Unknown Master draw our swords as a crowd gathers nearby. I slowly move closer, and my opponent does likewise, each of us studying each other's moves carefully. We both make careful probing attacks, and both of us deal with them easily enough, neither giving anything away. It is clear that the duel will not be decided quickly.\n\nI am pressed to my limits by my opponent, and though it at times seems as if I might be able to prevail I make one mistake too many, and my opponent inflicts several wounds on you in quick succession, one of them fatal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3144;And so it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3145;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName] has failed in [From.GetHerHis] quest to prove that [From.GetSheHe] is the best warrior in the world. Doubtlessly, someone else will get the opportunity to do so in the future, but one thing is clear, and it is that the Warriors of the Rising Sun were wrong to put their faith in the skills of [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3145;How disappointing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3148;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetBestName],\nThe Warriors of the Rising Sun appear to have been wrong to put their faith in you and your skills, as you have failed to prove that you are the best warrior to be found. Perhaps you will be able to redeem yourself in the future, but perhaps not...\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3148;I am a disappointment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3201;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI hereby request that you gather your warriors and come to my aid, in the name of the Warriors of the Rising Sun. Not doing so would definitely be a sign that you are not a [Root.GetManWoman] of honor.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3201;I will do as you ask!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3201;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3202;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI accept your call to arms as a fellow member of the Warriors of the Rising Sun. We shall fight side by side and prevail in this honorable struggle.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3202;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3203;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI have no intention to support you in your current wars. You should fight your own battles, as that is the honorable thing to do.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3203;You lack both honor and courage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3204;Not long after I send out the call for a worthy commander [invited_lodge_soldier.GetBestName] arrives and offers [invited_lodge_soldier.GetHerHis] services. Hopefully, [invited_lodge_soldier.GetSheHe] will serve me and the Warriors of the Rising Sun with honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3204;I bid you welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3205;With the last of my ongoing wars coming to an end the band of ronin that has been fighting for me has taken its leave, looking for other opportunities elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3205;As is their right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3206;A messenger has arrived from [FromFrom.GetBestName], bringing word that [FromFrom.GetSheHe], and thus all Warriors of the Rising Sun, now regard me as dishonorable. It should be evident to everyone that this is not the case, but sadly [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s words tend to carry quite a bit of weight among the Warriors of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3206;I will remember this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3207;A War of the Rising Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3207;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSocietyRank] of the Warriors of the Rising Sun, has proclaimed [From.GetHerHis] intention to launch a grand invasion involving all Warriors of the Rising Sun. [From.GetSheHeCap] has also expressed [From.GetHerHis] desire for other Warriors of the Rising Sun to assist with the preparations if they can.\n\nAt this point, it is uncertain when [From.GetBestName]'s preparations will be completed, and the target is currently unknown, but those near [From.GetHerHis] lands might wish to prepare for the possibility that they are the target.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3207;Worrying...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3207;It will be glorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3208;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI have undertaken several steps to help prepare for the upcoming war so that the Warriors of the Rising Sun may engage in glorious conquest sooner rather than later.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3208;All help is appreciated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3209;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYour assistance with the preparations for the war is certainly appreciated. I look forward to fighting alongside you on the battlefield.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3209;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3210;A War of the Rising Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3210;The promised invasion of the Warriors of the Rising Sun has come at last, quite possibly to the dismay of [rising_sun_subjugation_defender.GetBestName], whose realm is under attack.\n\nAt the command of [rising_sun_grandmaster.GetSocietyRank] [rising_sun_grandmaster.GetFirstName], the armies of the Rising Sun march forth, seeking to secure the [rising_sun_subjugation_target.GetFullName], with the spoils promised to the warrior that contributes the most. [rising_sun_grandmaster.GetBestName] is confident that [rising_sun_grandmaster.GetHerHis] forces will prevail, though perhaps that is because [rising_sun_grandmaster.GetSheHe] would be regarded as a poor warrior if they do not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3210;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3210;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3211;The time has come to take up arms and march against [rising_sun_subjugation_defender.GetBestName]. [rising_sun_grandmaster.GetBestName], the [rising_sun_grandmaster.GetSocietyRank] of the Warriors of the Rising Sun has let it be known that the [rising_sun_subjugation_target.GetFullName] will be granted to the warrior that contributes the most.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3211;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3213;With the death of [From.GetBestName] the invasion of the Warriors of the Rising Sun has been indefinitely postponed. Perhaps [From.GetHerHis] successor will make another attempt, but whether that will be the case is unknown as of yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3213;So much for that invasion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3213;How unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_3301;I am having a meal at a local tavern along with some other Warriors of the Rising Sun when one of them suddenly suggests that we should have a drinking contest. Several of the others express an interest in joining, and I suppose I could as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3301;A worthy challenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3301;A waste of my time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3302;After a decent number of rounds are done several of the other contestants declare that their forfeit, clearly not feeling confident in their ability to keep more sake down. I am having no such problems, and judging by how the few opponents that are left are doing I think I could win this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3302;Bring me another!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3302;Actually, I've had enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3303;After a decent number of rounds are done several of the other contestants declare that their forfeit, clearly not feeling confident in their ability to keep more sake down. I am doing fairly well, but so are my remaining opponents, so it is unclear how much more I would have to drink to beat them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3303;It should be fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3303;I should drink in moderation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3304;After a decent number of rounds are done several of the other contestants declare that their forfeit, clearly not feeling confident in their ability to keep more sake down. I am not feeling as well as I would like, while my remaining opponents are looking as if they are doing well. Perhaps beating them will be very hard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3304;I... I can do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3304;I can't win this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3305;One after the other my opponents either surrender gracefully or run off in the direction of the door after having had one drink too many. In the end I am the only one still in the contest, and victory is thus mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3305;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3306;One after the other my opponents either surrender gracefully or run off in the direction of the door after having had one drink too many. I end up having to drink quite a bit to outlast them all, but it is worth it as I end up the undisputed winner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3306;I look forward to next time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3307;One after the other my opponents either surrender gracefully or run off in the direction of the door after having had one drink too many. I am having no such problems, and can keep drinking by the time that I have won;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3307;Bring me another!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3308;One after the other my opponents either surrender gracefully or run off in the direction of the door after having had one drink too many. I remember winning the contest, but after that things get very hazy up until somewhere after I returned home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3308;I... suppose that worked...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3309;As the sake keeps coming I get less and less certain that I will be able to win the drinking contest, and by a certain point it is clear that I should stop drinking. Not wanting to make a fool of myself, I forfeit at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3309;You can't win them all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3310;As the sake keeps coming I get less and less certain that I will be able to win the drinking contest, and by a certain point it is clear that I should stop drinking. I have to forfeit at this point, but I must admit that I rather liked taking part in the drinking contest even so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3310;I'll win the next one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3311;As the sake keeps coming I get less and less certain that I will be able to win the drinking contest. Eventually, it becomes clear I should have stopped drinking several drinks back, as I am having trouble keeping the sake down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3311;Out of my way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3312;As the sake keeps coming I get less and less certain that I will be able to win the drinking contest even though I am a heavy drinker. My memory is hazy about just what happened towards the end of the contest other than the fact that I lost, and I wake up with a splitting headache the next morning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3312;My head...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3313;Though there are some Warriors of the Rising Sun that think that anything that is not useful in either warfare or personal combat is useless, there are also those that consider other skills worthwhile. Many have an interest in poetry, and I could certainly engage in that if I feel like it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3313;I should write a poem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3313;I have better things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3314;I could either write a poem dedicated to someone, or a poem just for myself. In the former case, I suppose I do not have to share the poem if I do not like what I have written, but sharing a good poem could be impress people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3314;My poem will be for [dedication_option_1.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3314;[dedication_option_2.GetBestName] deserves a poem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3314;I should write [dedication_option_3.GetBestName] a poem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3314;I'll just write it for myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3315;Before I can get started on my poem I need to decide what the topic will be. I can think of more than one topic, though I am not sure if they are equally appealing to me, or if they are things I would be equally good at.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3315;I'll go for flattery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3315;Mockery is the right choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3315;I'll attempt to flirt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3315;I'll write about warfare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_3315;Nature is a good subject!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_3315;I'll write about the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_SOH_3315;It'll be about single combat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3316;My poem is finally complete. Though I am not the most impartial judge of my own ability, I would think this is a very flattering poem, and I doubt [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetBestName] would find it at all disagreeable to read it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3316;I'm sure it'll be appreciated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3316;I'll keep this for myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3316;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3317;My poem is finally complete. I doubt anyone would consider it a masterpiece, but I doubt [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetBestName] would find it unflattering at the very least, and perhaps that is sufficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3317;I think this is worth sharing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3317;It's not good enough to share...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3317;I suppose it's acceptable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3318;My poem is finally complete. As much as I would prefer to pretend otherwise, it is really not a particularly good poem. [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetBestName] is unlikely to find this particularly flattering, and might even find it a bit offensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3318;Maybe it won't be so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3318;Nobody can ever see this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3318;I should burn this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3319;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], bringing a poem that [From.GetSheHe] apparently has dedicated to me. [Root.GetFlatteringPoemQualityDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsGoodFlatteringPoem;The poem turns out to be quite impressive, and it speaks quite highly of me and my many good qualities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsBadFlatteringPoem;I think [From.GetSheHe] was going for flattery, but the poem certainly did not come across that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsAverageFlatteringPoem;The poem is about what [From.GetBestName] thinks are my best qualities, though the quality of the poem is not the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3319;[From.GetSheHeCap] is a good friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3319;Maybe we can be friends?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3319;I'm not sure how to take this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3319;That was almost insulting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3320;My good friend [From.GetBestName] has send word that [From.GetSheHe] found the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim] quite flattering indeed, and that [From.GetSheHe] is glad I am [From.GetHerHis] friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3320;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3321;It seems [From.GetBestName] truly appreciated my poem and found it very flattering, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] thinks we should be friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3321;That sounds like a great idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3321;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3322;[From.GetBestName] was most happy to hear that I thought that we should be friends, and [From.GetSheHe] let me know that I most definitely can consider [From.GetHerHim] a friend from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3322;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3323;Though [From.GetBestName] did not seem displeased to hear that I had found [From.GetHerHis] poem quite flattering [From.GetSheHe] made it clear that [From.GetSheHe] does not think [From.GetSheHe] knows me well enough to call me [From.GetHerHis] friend just yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3323;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3324;I had hoped that [From.GetBestName] would let me know what [From.GetSheHe] thought of the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim], but [From.GetSheHe] apparently does not seem interested in responding to it in any way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3324;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3325;The response I got from [From.GetBestName] regarding my poem was certainly not what I had expected. [From.GetSheHeCap] almost seemed offended by having received it, which was the opposite of what I had hoped for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3325;That could have gone better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3326;My poem is finally complete. Though I am not the most impartial judge of my own ability, I would think that [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetBestName] will find the mockery in this poem to be particularly vicious, and that [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetSheHe] will find it hard to refute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3326;I'm sure this will be upsetting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3326;I'll keep this for myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3326;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3327;My poem is finally complete. I doubt anyone would consider it a masterpiece, but [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetBestName] will likely find it mocking even so, and that might be good enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3327;I think this works!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3327;It's not good enough to share...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3327;I suppose it's acceptable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3328;My poem is finally complete. As much as I would prefer to pretend otherwise, it is really not a particularly good poem. While I think [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetBestName] would be able to tell I was trying to mock [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetHerHim], [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetSheHe] might mock the quality of my writing if [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetSheHe] gets to read this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3328;Well, [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetSheHe] doesn't deserve a good poem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3328;Nobody can ever see this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3328;I should burn this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3329;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], bringing a poem that [From.GetSheHe] apparently has dedicated to me. [Root.GetMockingPoemQualityDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsGoodMockingPoem;Though the poem is very good from a quality standpoint, it also turns out to be a very viciously mocking poem about me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsBadMockingPoem;It seems likely [From.GetBestName] was trying to mock me, but the quality of the poem is terrible enough that that is almost impossible to tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsAverageMockingPoem;The poem is certainly not the best I have read, and [From.GetBestName]'s attempt to mock me in the poem leaves something to be desired.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3329;How dare you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3329;I'll never forgive this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3329;It was fairly mild...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3329;This is an insult to poetry, not to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3330;I have received word that [From.GetBestName] seems to have taken the mockery in the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim] quite personally. Considering we have been rivals for some time, [From.GetSheHe] certainly should not have expected a kinder poem from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3330;That went as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3331;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] considers the fact that I would send [From.GetHerHim] a poem like the one I wrote utterly dishonorable, and that it is clear I wish for us to be enemies. It seems my mockery was not just vicious, but also quite effective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3331;Just as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3332;I had hoped that [From.GetBestName] would let me know what [From.GetSheHe] thought of the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim], but [From.GetSheHe] apparently does not seem interested in responding to it in any way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3332;I should have mocked [From.GetHerHim] more thoroughly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3333;I had not expected [From.GetBestName] to praise my poem, but [From.GetSheHe] went as far as to call it an insult to poetry. [From.GetSheHeCap] was also rather dismissive of my attempt to mock [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3333;I'll never forgive this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3334;It seems [From.GetBestName] now considers us to be enemies, largely thanks to the brutally honest feedback I sent [From.GetHerHim] regarding the rather terrible poem [From.GetSheHe] wrote in an attempt to mock me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3334;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3335;[From.GetBestName] has certainly proven that [From.GetSheHe] deserves to be my rival today, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to send me a letter in which [From.GetSheHe] makes it clear that [From.GetSheHe] considers my latest poem an insult to poetry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3335;How dare you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3336;My poem is finally complete. Though I am not the most impartial judge of my own ability, I would expect [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetBestName] to find this poem quite charming, and [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetSheHe] will hopefully take an interest in me when [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetSheHe] reads it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3336;I'm sure it'll be appreciated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3336;I'll keep this for myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3336;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3337;My poem is finally complete. I doubt anyone would consider it a masterpiece, but maybe [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetBestName] will still find it somewhat charming, even if I should not have too high hopes about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3337;I think this is worth sharing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3337;It's not good enough to share...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3337;I suppose it's acceptable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3338;My poem is finally complete. As much as I would prefer to pretend otherwise, it is really not a particularly good poem. It is possible [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetBestName] would not be offended by it, but I really doubt [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetSheHe] would find it particularly charming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3338;Maybe it won't be so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3338;Nobody can ever see this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3338;I should burn this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3339;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], bringing a poem that [From.GetSheHe] apparently has dedicated to me. [Root.GetFlirtingPoemQualityDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsGoodFlirtingPoem;The poetry is quite charming, and also rather suggestive, and I am pretty sure [From.GetBestName] likes me quite a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsBadFlirtingPoem;I think [From.GetSheHe] was trying to come across as charming, but the writing is quite obscene, and the poem is most certainly not good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsAverageFlirtingPoem;The poem is somewhat suggestive, and a bit charming, though it is not a true masterpiece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3339;[From.GetSheHeCap] definitely loves me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3339;I should proposition [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3339;I should not encourage this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3339;That wasn't a great poem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_3339;That was pretty terrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3340;[From.GetBestName] has let me know that [From.GetSheHe] definitely appreciated the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim], and that [From.GetHerHis] love for me has never been greater than it is now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3340;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3341;It seems the poem I sent [From.GetBestName] was quite effective as [From.GetSheHe] has come to me with the suggestion that we perhaps should become lovers, or at least should have a good tumble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3341;We should become lovers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3341;I'll give [From.GetHerHim] a good tumble!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3341;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3342;[From.GetBestName] was open to the idea of getting to know me rather more intimately, much as I had expected, and by the time we had to part ways for the time being [From.GetSheHe] let me know that [From.GetSheHe] looks forward to similar activities together in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3342;This is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3343;[From.GetBestName] was open to the idea of getting to know me rather more intimately, much as I had expected. [From.GetSheHeCap] did, however, make it clear that it only was a one-time thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3343;That's fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3344;It is possible I misjudged [From.GetBestName]'s intentions with the poem, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] turned down my suggestion that we should get to know one another rather more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3344;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3345;I had hoped that [From.GetBestName] would let me know what [From.GetSheHe] thought of the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim], but [From.GetSheHe] apparently does not seem interested in responding to it in any way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3345;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3346;[From.GetBestName] did not seem to find my poem at all charming, and it is possible [From.GetSheHe] found it insulting instead considering that [From.GetSheHe] suggested that I should refrain from trying something similar in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3346;That could have gone better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3347;My poem is finally complete. Though I am not the most impartial judge of my own ability, I think I truly have managed to convey what I wished to say about warfare, which is a topic the Warriors of the Rising Sun tend to approve of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3347;I'm sure it'll be appreciated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3347;I'll keep this for myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3347;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3348;My poem is finally complete. I doubt anyone would consider it a masterpiece, but maybe some Warriors of the Rising Sun would still appreciate it since I have given a fairly decent account of the matter of warfare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3348;I think this is worth sharing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3348;It's not good enough to share...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3348;I suppose it's acceptable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3349;My poem is finally complete. As much as I would prefer to pretend otherwise, it is really not a particularly good poem. I suspect most Warriors of the Rising Sun that might read it would find my depiction of warfare rather questionable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3349;Maybe it won't be so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3349;Nobody can ever see this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3349;I should burn this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3350;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], bringing a poem that [From.GetSheHe] apparently has dedicated to me. [Root.GetWarfarePoemQualityDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsGoodWarfarePoem;[From.GetBestName] has written about warfare, and it is clear that [From.GetSheHe] has a good grasp of both this and poetry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsBadWarfarePoem;It is a rather confusing poem about warfare, and I am not sure whether the quality of the poem or the description of warfare is worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsAverageWarfarePoem;I would say it is a decent poem, though the way [From.GetBestName] writes about warfare is not as good as it could be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3350;An excellent poem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3350;I suppose it could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3350;That was pretty bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3351;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] really liked the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim] and that [From.GetSheHe] looks forward to reading more poems by me in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3351;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3352;I had hoped that [From.GetBestName] would let me know what [From.GetSheHe] thought of the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim], but [From.GetSheHe] apparently does not seem interested in responding to it in any way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3352;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3353;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim] was not really to [From.GetHerHis] liking, and a polite suggestion that I either should spend quite a bit of time practicing poetry before sharing any more of it or should consider doing something else entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3353;Very unfortunate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3354;My poem is finally complete. Though I am not the most impartial judge of my own ability, I think I have managed to describe the beauty of nature in a fashion that would make even a blind [Root.GetManWoman] able to understand it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3354;I'm sure it'll be appreciated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3354;I'll keep this for myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3354;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3355;My poem is finally complete. I doubt anyone would consider it a masterpiece, but I suppose it could be considerably worse. At least I have not just written something involving nothing but cherry blossoms...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3355;I think this is worth sharing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3355;It's not good enough to share...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3355;I suppose it's acceptable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3356;My poem is finally complete. As much as I would prefer to pretend otherwise, it is really not a particularly good poem. Everything I could think about when writing it was cherry blossoms, and I am not sure I even described those particularly well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3356;Maybe it won't be so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3356;Nobody can ever see this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

IsGoodNaturePoem;[From.GetBestName] has written a very beautiful poem about nature, which is unlike anything I have ever read in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsBadNaturePoem;The poem turns out to be a very unimaginative and poorly written description of cherry blossoms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsAverageNaturePoem;I would not say [From.GetBestName] has written a masterpiece, but at least it is somewhat imaginative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3357;An excellent poem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_SOH_3357;That was pretty bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_3360;Very unfortunate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3361;My poem is finally complete. Though I am not the most impartial judge of my own ability, I would say that what I have written would impress nearly everyone that follows the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3361;I'm sure it'll be appreciated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3361;I'll keep this for myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3361;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3362;My poem is finally complete. I doubt anyone would consider it a masterpiece, but I doubt any but the most critical of readers would say that I have written something that would offend the faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SOH_3362;It's not good enough to share...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3362;I suppose it's acceptable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3363;My poem is finally complete. As much as I would prefer to pretend otherwise, it is really not a particularly good poem. A very forgiving reader might give me the benefit of the doubt, but most would likely think I meant to offend the faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

IsGoodReligionPoem;[From.GetSheHe] has written about the [From.Religion.GetName] faith in a truly beautiful fashion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsBadReligionPoem;I think [From.GetBestName] was trying to impress those following the [From.Religion.GetName] faith, but the poem comes across as somewhat offensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsAverageReligionPoem;I think the poem is decent, but perhaps [From.GetSheHe] should not have written about the [From.Religion.GetBestName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3364;An excellent poem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3364;I suppose it could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_3367;Very unfortunate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3368;My poem is finally complete. Though I am not the most impartial judge of my own ability, I think I have managed to describe the matter of personal combat in a very satisfactory fashion, and the Warriors of the Rising Sun would likely approve of the poem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_3370;Maybe it won't be so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3370;Nobody can ever see this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3370;I should burn this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3371;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], bringing a poem that [From.GetSheHe] apparently has dedicated to me. [Root.GetPCSPoemQualityDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsGoodPCSPoem;It is a very evocative depiction of personal combat, and I have never read anything as good in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsBadPCSPoem;It is about personal combat, I can tell, but it is too confusing to tell much aside from that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsAveragePCSPoem;[From.GetBestName] has written about personal combat, and though the poem is no masterpiece it is also not a bad poem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3371;An excellent poem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3371;I suppose it could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3371;That was pretty bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3372;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] really liked the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim] and that [From.GetSheHe] looks forward to reading more poems by me in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3372;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3373;I had hoped that [From.GetBestName] would let me know what [From.GetSheHe] thought of the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim], but [From.GetSheHe] apparently does not seem interested in responding to it in any way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3373;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3374;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim] was not really to [From.GetHerHis] liking, and a polite suggestion that I either should spend quite a bit of time practicing poetry before sharing any more of it or should consider doing something else entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3374;Very unfortunate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3375;I got the response I was hoping for to my latest poem, and I think it is clear I have some talent for poetry and that I should consider writing more poetry in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3375;I can call myself a poet now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3376;I already considered myself a skilled poet before sending out my latest creation, and seeing as the response I received to it was what I was hoping for it is clear that I am not mistaken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3376;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3377;I have never been particularly good at the field my education was focused on. Perhaps I should instead focus on warfare, particularly as that would be quite appreciated by the Warriors of the Rising Sun?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3377;That would be a good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3377;No, I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3378;As a Warrior of the Rising Sun I have been expected to at least maintain my current level of skill with various weapons, and as a result of sparring with them quite a bit I have become stronger than I used to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3378;I feel powerful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3379;In order to not come across as a complete fool when discussing matters of warfare with my fellow Warriors of the Rising Sun I have needed to spend some time reading up on various related things, and I have come to realize that I really enjoy doing that far more than I had thought I would;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3379;This isn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3380;Though there are some that think that aggression is the best approach to combat my time among the Warriors of the Rising Sun has made me realize that that is not really the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3380;A warrior's greatest weapon... is patience!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3381;After seeing several rather arrogant members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun get defeated in personal combat by opponents they underestimated I have become quite aware that being proud of your skills is not the same as actually being skilled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3381;Arrogance is a weakness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3382;Being a Warrior of the Rising Sun means that I certainly am one of the better warriors in the world, and a skilled general on top of that. After all, we do not allow just anyone to join our ranks...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3382;I have reason to be proud!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3383;As a Warrior of the Rising Sun I can most likely find allies or rally soldiers to my cause more easily than most, and though I certainly do not have to take advantage of that I am starting to think that I probabaly should.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3383;I should strive for more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3384;The Warriors of the Rising Sun do not approve of cowardice, and though there was a time when some of them would have considered me a coward I have been working hard to get past my fear, and I have certainly become braver as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3384;Fear is for the enemy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3385;Though there are ways in which one can get ahead by being dishonest the Warriors of the Rising Sun do not approve of such tactics, and over time I have come to realize that I agree more and more with that sentiment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3385;There is no honor in dishonesty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3386;There are some that would say that honor only is for the battlefield and duels, but others would say that there is no honor in injustice. I am finding myself agreeing with the latter group more and more as a result of my time as a Warrior of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3386;Honor and justice must prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3387;It is well known that the Warriors of the Rising Sun value honor and honesty. As such, it should be clear to everyone that my rival,  [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName], is not worthy of anyone's respect, but sadly few seem to have noticed this. Perhaps I could change that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3387;I will give it a try...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3387;This is not worth my time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3388;[From.GetBestName] approached me today to discuss the matter of [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. I have long known that the two of them do not like one another, but I had not heard the full story before, and after hearing it it is clear to me that I must help [From.GetBestName] against [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName] in whatever manner I can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3388;It is the right thing to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3389;I have learned that my hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], has spoken to [From.GetBestName] about me. Despite the fact that it is [FromFrom.GetBestName] that has been acting in a dishonorable manner when interacting with me it seems that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] still has managed to convince [From.GetBestName] that [From.GetSheHe] should oppose me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3389;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3390;[From.GetBestName] listened carefully to what I told [From.GetHerHim] about [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName], and once I had finished [From.GetSheHe] told me that [From.GetSheHe] was convinced I am in the right. The fact that I embellished a few things here and there and skipped some minor details about my own doings probably helped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3390;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3391;[From.GetBestName] approached me today to discuss the matter of [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. Based on what I was told it is very possible that [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName] is dishonorable and should be regarded as a threat, but as [From.GetBestName] very likely is biased I am not entirely certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3391;Maybe I should keep my guard up...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3392;I have learned that my hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], has spoken to [From.GetBestName] about me and my actions. Though it seems that [From.GetBestName] has some reservations [From.GetSheHe] still seems to be at least somewhat convinced that my dishonorable rival is correct about me being dishonorable, even though this obviously is false.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3392;This could be bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3393;[From.GetBestName] listened carefully to what I had to say about [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName], and though [From.GetSheHe] told me that [From.GetSheHe] was not fully convinced that things are as bad as I told [From.GetHerHim] I believe I still managed to make [From.GetHerHim] at least somewhat suspicious of my rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3393;I suppose it's a start...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3394;[From.GetBestName] approached me today to discuss the matter of [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] had quite a few things to say about [From.GetHerHis] rival, and what [From.GetSheHe] told me would certainly be cause for concern if [From.GetSheHe] was speaking truthfully, but I am unsure whether that was the case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3394;I'm not sure what to think...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3395;[From.GetBestName] listened carefully to what I had to say about [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. I had expected my arguments to be sufficient, but when I was finished [From.GetBestName] told me that [From.GetSheHe] is no more convinced than when I started.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3395;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3396;[From.GetBestName] approached me today to discuss the matter of [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. Though [From.GetBestName] could point to many things that [From.GetSheHe] thought would prove that [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName] is dishonorable and someone that should be my enemy I felt that the story [From.GetBestName] told me was somewhat distorted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3396;It certainly was a bit suspect...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3397;I have learned that my hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], has spoken to [From.GetBestName] about me and my actions. It seems that [From.GetSheHe] was unconvinced, however, and that [From.GetSheHe] now might be a bit more inclined to take my side over the side of [FromFrom.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3397;That is good to know...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3398;[From.GetBestName] listened carefully to what I had to say about [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName], and when I was finished [From.GetSheHe] told me that some of the things I said really did not make much sense. As I had to be a bit creative about how I framed some things that is perhaps to be expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3398;I suppose it could have gone worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3399;[From.GetBestName] approached me today to discuss the matter of [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. As far as I could tell, [From.GetSheHe] was blowing things massively out of proportion, and [From.GetHerHis] own actions seemed rather dishonest when I considered them more carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3399;It is the other way around!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3400;I have learned that my hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], has spoken to [From.GetBestName] about me and my actions. Luckily for me, my rival failed to make [FromFrom.GetHerHis] lies convincing, and [From.GetBestName] now considers me a friend and my rival [From.GetHerHis] enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3400;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3401;[From.GetBestName] listened carefully to what I had to say about [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName], and when I was done [From.GetSheHe] told me that what I said simply convinced [From.GetHerHim] that I was the dishonorable party and that [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName] is in the right. It seems I have gained a new enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3401;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3402;Today I took part in a discussion about the advancement of military knowledge with other members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun. Though it of course is important to preserve old and honorable traditions, some new advances can still be taken advantage of, and I learned about a number of promising things today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3402;A valuable discussion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3403;Some other Warriors of the Rising Sun have invited me to participate in a discussion of matters related to warfare in the hopes that we all may learn something from one another. I am free to turn down the offer, of course, but perhaps it would be in my interest to participate?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3403;I will participate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3403;I have better things to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3404;I did quite well during the discussion with the other Warriors of the Rising Sun, and while I did not learn anything in particular several of the others praised my knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3404;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3405;I did quite well during the discussion with the other Warriors of the Rising Sun, and while I did not learn anything in particular several of the others praised my knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3405;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3406;I learned a lot discussing martial matters some other Warriors of the Rising Sun, and I feel I really have a much better understanding of the subject now than I had previously.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3406;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3407;The discussion I had with the other Warriors of the Rising Sun could certainly have gone better, but unlike some of those present I did not make a fool out of myself by showing that I was completely ignorant of the subject we were discussing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3407;I suppose that went okay...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3408;I did very poorly during the discussing with the other Warriors of the Rising Sun, and I also did not learn anything of note. It is clear that several of those present respect me and my opinion a lot less now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3408;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3409;I did very poorly during the discussing with the other Warriors of the Rising Sun, and I also did not learn anything of note. It is clear that several of those present respect me and my opinion a lot less now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3409;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3410;Some other Warriors of the Rising Sun have offered me the opportunity to spar with them. It is possible this will help me become a better warrior, though of course there is also a risk of injury if things go poorly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3410;I'll participate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3410;I have better things to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3411;The sparring session went very well, and I learned several useful things from the others that were present. I expect I will do better as a warrior in the future as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3411;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3412;Though I did not learn anything noteworthy during the sparring session the other Warriors of the Rising Sun that were present spoke highly of my skills and told me they appreciated my presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3412;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3413;Though I did not learn anything noteworthy during the sparring session the other Warriors of the Rising Sun that were present spoke highly of my skills and told me they appreciated my presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3413;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3414;While I did not make a complete fool of myself while sparring with the other Warriors of the Rising Sun I also did not perform quite as well as some of the others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3414;I suppose it could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3415;Things did not go well during the sparring session with the other Warriors of the Rising Sun as I made a mistake that resulted in me being injured by my sparring partner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3415;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3416;Though I managed to avoid injuring myself while sparring with some other Warriors of the Rising Sun I did not impress anyone with my skills, and some of those present even seemed quite disappointed by my performance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3416;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3417;Though I managed to avoid injuring myself while sparring with some other Warriors of the Rising Sun I did not impress anyone with my skills, and some of those present even seemed quite disappointed by my performance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3417;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3418;The sparring session went extremely poorly for me, and I managed to get badly injured. I would have liked to blame someone else for my injury, but the truth is that it was all my fault.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3418;I shouldn't have done this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
