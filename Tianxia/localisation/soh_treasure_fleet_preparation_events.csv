EVTTITLE_SOH_7801;A Treasure Fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7801;I have proclaimed that a Treasure Fleet is to be made ready for a grand voyage to show off the might of the Middle Kingdom and to make it clear to the barbarians of the world that my dynasty possesses the Mandate of Heaven.\n\nThis undertaking will require a large amount of preparation, and though I have already made a large quantity of funds available I might end up having to contribute more to ensure everything goes smoothly. Hopefully, both the bureaucrats at my court and various provincial governors will see fit to contribute as well. Some of them might even see fit to accompany the Treasure Fleet when it sails.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7801;This is the start of an auspicious undertaking!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_7802;A Treasure Fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7802;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has proclaimed that a Treasure Fleet is to be made ready and that it is to visit the ports of various barbarian realms outside the Middle Kingdom. The [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven doubtlessly intends for this to show the world that [From.GetHerHis] imperial dynasty's claim to possesses the Mandate of Heaven is irrefutable, and a successful voyage might well end up doing just that.\n\nSo far, I have not received any specific instructions as to how I am expected to contribute to the voyage, but it is possible I could make a contribution, for good or ill...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7802;Perhaps I should ask to accompany the Treasure Fleet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7802;This is some bureaucratic nonsense...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_7803;A Treasure Fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7803;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has proclaimed that a Treasure Fleet is to be made ready and that it is to visit the ports of various barbarian realms outside the Middle Kingdom. The [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven doubtlessly intends for this to show the world that [From.GetHerHis] imperial dynasty's claim to possesses the Mandate of Heaven is irrefutable, and a successful voyage might well end up doing just that.\n\nOf course, a less successful voyage might end up doing more harm than good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7803;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7803;This does not concern me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_7803;Let's hope it fails!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7805;As the preparations for the Treasure Fleet's voyage continue I find myself wondering if there is anything I might do to contribute to it aside from approving the occasional request that the court bureaucrats cannot handle on their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7805;I will invest more money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7805;I will make a grand proclamation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_7805;I will ask various temples to contribute!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_7805;I will make a grand speech!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_7805;I will oversee the military preparations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_7805;I will look into trade goods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_SOH_7805;I will consult my spies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTH_SOH_7805;I will consult my books!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTI_SOH_7805;I will see to it that more ships are gathered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTJ_SOH_7805;I will ensure more soldiers are readied!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTK_SOH_7805;I will make sure the fleet's supplies are in order!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTL_SOH_7805;I will ensure suitable artifacts are readied!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTM_SOH_7805;I will recruit travellers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTN_SOH_7805;Actually, I don't think I will get involved...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7806;Thanks to my investment, the coffers of the Treasure Fleet have grown substantially. Should the Treasure Fleet need to purchase supplies, or should some foreign barbarian require a monetary gift, the matter should be resolved in a satisfactory manner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7806;Money well spent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7807;Though I believe that my investment into the Treasure Fleet has helped to some extent, it does not seem to have made as big an impact as I had hoped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7807;Every little bit helps...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7808;The money I invested into the Treasure Fleet only served to attract attention to the wealth being amassed, and my careless instructions to the bureaucrats overseeing the fleet's treasury only made them less interested in trying to keep costs down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7808;I think that was a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7809;My proclamation seems to have had the desired effect, seeing as various bureaucrats across the Middle Kingdom have reported a marked increase when it comes to the commoners' interest in the Treasure Fleet and their willingness to contribute to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7809;That was a good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7810;I have received a few reports indicating that my proclamation has made the commoners of the Middle Kingdom a bit more interested in taking part in the preparations surrounding the Treasure Fleet, but not as many as I had hoped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7810;I suppose it helped a bit...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7811;It seems my proclamation had the opposite effect of what I was hoping for, as many provincial bureaucrats have reported that many commoners seem to have started to doubt the wisdom of preparing a Treasure Fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7811;Maybe that was a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7812;I have received word that many temples across the Middle Kingdom have seen fit to contribute to the Treasure Fleet, seeing it as a blessed undertaking that only will benefit the realm. Clearly, my decision to lean on them was a good one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7812;They have my thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7813;A few temples have seen fit to contribute to the Treasure Fleet following my request that they should do so, but many have made no reply or have only offered excuses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7813;It's better than nothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7814;It seems like many of the temples across the Middle Kingdom that received my request to contribute to the Treasure Fleet have deemed it a bad idea. Worse, word has spread that they will not be contributing, lowering the commoners' willingness to contribute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7814;That did not go as I expected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7815;I attend a large gathering of officials overseeing the preparations of the Treasure Fleet and deliver my prepared speech in front of them. Judging by their expressions when I finish, my words have convinced them that the Treasure Fleet demands nothing short of their full attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7815;I have a way with words!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7816;I attend a large gathering of officials overseeing the preparations of the Treasure Fleet and deliver my prepared speech in front of them. Few of them seem to have changed their minds one way or another by the time that I finish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7816;Better than nothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7817;I attend a large gathering of officials overseeing the preparations of the Treasure Fleet and deliver my prepared speech in front of them. Judging by their expressions when I finish, my words have convinced them that the Treasure Fleet is a collossal mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7817;Perhaps they are right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7818;I go over the plans regarding the soldiers meant to accompany the Treasure Fleet and their preparations for various eventualities, spotting several areas that could use some improvement. I instruct the officers meant to accompany the soldiers accordingly, and I soon receive word that the Treasure Fleet's forces have grown stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7818;That worked quite well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7819;I go over the plans regarding the soldiers meant to accompany the Treasure Fleet and their preparations for various eventualities. I do not notice anything particularly important as far as I can tell, but I doubt I made the situation any worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7819;I probably helped...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7820;I go over the plans regarding the soldiers meant to accompany the Treasure Fleet and their preparations for various eventualities. I make several suggestions as to how the Treasure Fleet could be made stronger, but judging by the looks on the faces of the officers in attendance they doubt the wisdom of my words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7820;I might have made things worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7821;After reviewing various reports submitted by traders trading in the ports of the Middle Kingdom I have managed to determine just what kind of trade goods would be worthwhile to bring along with the Treasure Fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7821;This will benefit the Middle Kingdom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7822;I have not managed to determine anything in particular that will help the Treasure Fleet when it comes to trading with various barbarian realms it might visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7822;I suppose that did not help much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7823;After reading several reports concerning trade I order for several new kinds of trade goods to be gathered for the Treasure Fleet and some of the previously gathered ones to be sold to make room for the new ones. Unfortunately, it seems I mixed up the goods that were sold to foreign buyers with the ones sold to buyers in the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7823;Terrible news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7824;It takes me some time to review the many reports submitted by imperial spies aborad, but eventually a clear picture emerges. I give the order to change several things as far as the Treasure Fleet goes so that it will be in a better position to carry out its intended purpose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7824;Knowledge is power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7825;The reports I receive from imperial spies abroad are conflicting in many places, and not as thorough as I would have liked in others. I do the best I can with the information.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7825;I had hoped for more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7826;I discover several promising reports from imperial spies abroad and order several major changes to the Treasure Fleet's preparations to be made based on those reports. Unfortunately, I later discover that the reports in question were quite outdated in many cases.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7826;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7827;I manage to find several promising books containing information regarding the disparate groups of foreign barbarians in the ports the Treasure Fleet might end up visiting. This information allows me to order several improvements to be made as far as the fleet's preparations goes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7827;Knowledge is power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7828;Though I manage to find some books about various foreign realms potentially relevant to the Treasure Fleet it seems many of them were written by authors that were more interested in proving their own superiority to the foreign barbarians than in providing useful information.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7828;I found a few useful tidbits...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7829;I manage to find a great number of books containing vivid descriptions of the barbarian lands the Treasure Fleet might end up visiting and order preparations made accordingly. However, I later learn that the books in question were written by authors more interested in telling tall tales than in telling the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7829;So much for trusting in books...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7830;I go through various reports concerning the ports of the Middle Kingdom and their capacity for shipbuilding, and send orders to ensure that resources are sent where they will do the most good. I soon receive word that the previous estimates as to how many ships could be prepared in time need to be revised.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7830;The grand fleet grows even grander!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7831;I go through some reports concerning which ports might be able to prepare some additional ships for the Treasure Fleet and manage to identify one or two promising candidates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7831;It will help a bit...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7832;I have wood and other resources useful for shipbuilding sent to all the ports of the Middle Kingdom, condifent that it will help the Treasure Fleet grow stronger. Unfortunately, it seems my hasty instructions were imprecise, resulting in many ports ending up with an abundance of one thing but a lack of another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7832;That's not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7833;I spend several days going over the latest census reports from various provinces and the strength estimates of various garrisons, discovering a number of locations where additional soldiers could be gathered for the Treasure Fleet. Thanks to my efforts, a mighty host will be gathered to accompany the fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7833;Mighty indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7834;I try to determine which garrisons in the Middle Kingdom I might be able to safely order weakened in order to strengthen the Treasure Fleet, but in many cases it does not seem to be viable to significantly weaken any of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7834;One man here, one man there...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7835;I revise the number of soldiers to be recruited from various provinces and have the new instructions sent to the local authorities immediately. Unfortunately, it seems the numbers I based my revisions on were not the correct ones, and that the new instructions asked for smaller contributions from various garrisons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7835;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7836;With the help of a large number of court bureaucrats I go through the supply estimates for the Treasure Fleet to see what might be improved. It takes some work, but in the end we have discovered several things that the Treasure Fleet might be lacking, and orders are sent out to deal with the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7836;They will want for nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7837;Though I enlist a large number of court bureaucrats to help go through the supply estimates for the Treasure Fleet we are unable to find anything in particular that it will require. A few minor suggestions are made in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7837;It should help a bit...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7838;I gather a larger number of court bureaucrats to help the Treasure Fleet amass further supplies, but though we end up dispatching several orders for additional supplies many of them are not sent to the right place. Worse, the instructions in many cases tell the local officials to disregard all previous requests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7838;That's not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7839;I spend some time revising the proposed lists of artifacts to be gathered for the Treasure Fleet, noting that several of them were overly concerned with quality rather than quantity. The foreign barbarians cannot all expect to receive gifts that would be suitable for the [Root.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7839;Quantity has a quality of its own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7840;I notice that many of the artifacts that already have been gathered for the Treasure Fleet are of a rather poor quality, and give the order to focus on gathering some better ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7840;I think that will be good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7841;I send word to verify the number of artifacts already gathered for the Treasure Fleet to better know what it might be lacking. Unfortunately, this turns out to have been a terrible idea, as word gets out that there are priceless artifacts in various poorly guarded warehouses, and many of them are ransacked by thieves before long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7841;I did more harm than good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7842;I send out word that the Treasure Fleet has room for more travellers, and before long I receive news that many have seen fit to apply to join it. Scholars, courtesans, soldiers, and many others will soon be visiting foreign lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7842;The more the merrier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7843;I ask to see some of the previously rejected requests made by people wishing to join the Treasure Fleet to see if mistakes have been made. In most cases, the bureaucrats that sent out the rejections were right to reject the applicants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7843;I found one good candidate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7844;Though some people apply to join the Treasure Fleet after I send out a request for more applicants my phrasing apparently convinced some of those that already were to be part of the voyage that their presence no longer is required, resulting in a lower number of people going on the voyage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7844;That's not what I meant at all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7845;A representative for a number of foreign shipwrights has submitted an offer to assist with the construction of the ships for the Treasure Fleet in exchange for some money. They are asking for a surprisingly low amount.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7845;The Dragon Throne accepts your offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7845;The Dragon Throne does not require foreign assistance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7846;The foreign shipwrights turn out to be quite skilled, and before long I receive a large number of reports that their assitance has proven invaluable. It seems I made a good investment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7846;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7847;The foreign shipwrights turn out to have been quite a bit less skilled than their representative made them out to be. They do more damage to the ships they are working on than even the clumsiest of the locals have managed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7847;I should not have trusted barbarians...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7848;The Dragon Throne is preparing a Treasure Fleet, and though I have not been asked to contribute it is possible I could do so. Of course, I should ask for something in return...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7848;I will ask for some Grace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7848;I will request a looser relationship!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_7848;I don't want to assist the Treasure Fleet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7849;[From.GetBestName] has offered [From.GetHerHis] assistance with the preparations for the Treasure Fleet, asking for some Grace in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_7876;I put a great deal of effort into the speech I deliver to various minor officials helping out with the preparations for the Treasure Fleet. As soon as I finish it is clear that I have inspired them to work harder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_7878;That was not the plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7878;All according to plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7879;I put a great effort into revising the plans for various military contingencies that might be required by the Treasure Fleet. Based on the reactions I receive when I finish, the new plans will make the Treasure Fleet significantly stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_7905;That was not the plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7905;All according to plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7906;It seems [From.GetBestName]'s assistance has been most beneficial for the Treasure Fleet. Several minor bureaucrats have praised [From.GetHerHis] input, stating that [From.GetSheHe] has helped them find and fix several issues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_7907;And yet [From.GetSheHe] doesn't seem happy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7908;[From.GetBestName]'s assistance seems to have resulted in some very minor benefits to the Treasure Fleet as a whole despite [From.GetHerHim] seemingly putting in an effort to help out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7908;It is better than nothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7909;[From.GetBestName]'s assistance seems to have resulted in some very minor harm to the Treasure Fleet as a whole despite [From.GetHerHim] seemingly putting in an effort to help out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7909;I suppose no real damage was done...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7910;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName]'s assistance with the preparations for the Treasure Fleet has resulted in considerable disruptions and the Treasure Fleet consequently being much worse off than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7910;[From.GetSheHeCap] did nothing right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7911;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName]'s assistance with the preparations for the Treasure Fleet has resulted in considerable disruptions and the Treasure Fleet consequently being much worse off than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7911;How strange [From.GetSheHe] doesn't seem upset...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7912;As a symbol of [treasure_fleet_sender.GetBestName] and [treasure_fleet_sender.GetHerHis] dynasty possessing the Mandate of Heaven, the Treasure Fleet is an affront to the Mandate Defiers. Destroying it would doubtlessly help bring about interesting times in the Middle Kingdom...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7912;I will see it burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7912;This is far too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7913;I make my way to one of the major ports where the Treasure Fleet is being prepared easily enough, and infiltrate the area under the cover of darkness. A few dark incantations later several ships and warehouses are aflame, and I successfully slip away into the night before the guards can secure the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7913;Such pretty flames!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7914;I have just received word that someone managed to infiltrate one of the ports where the Treasure Fleet is being readied and set several ships and warehouses ablaze. The guards did not manage to catch the person or persons responsible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7914;Who could have done this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7915;I make my way to one of the major ports where the Treasure Fleet is being prepared easily enough, and infiltrate the area under the cover of darkness.

EVTDESC_SOH_7919;I make my way to one of the major ports where the Treasure Fleet is being prepared easily enough, and attempt to infiltrate the area under the cover of darkness. The guards are more alert than I expected, however, and they catch me fairly quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7919;That could have gone better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7920;I have been informed that [From.GetBestName] attempted to infiltrate one of the ports where the Treasure Fleet is being prepared, no doubt for nefarious purposes. The guards caught [From.GetHerHim], however, and [From.GetSheHe] did no damage to the Treasure Fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7920;Make sure to keep it well guarded!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7921;Though it is not considered to be directly in opposition to the dark powers that I serve the Treasure Fleet's destruction might be quite amusing, and I might be in a good position to ensure it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_7930;I consider myself quite skilled at infiltration and sabotage, though it has been some time since I last attempted something challenging in that regard. Sabotaging the Treasure Fleet would certainly be challening, however...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
