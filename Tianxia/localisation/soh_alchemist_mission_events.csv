EVTDESC_SOH_11403;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt has come to my attention that you do not currently possess very many alchemical ingredients. Surely you must know that a member of the Renowned Apothecary Society cannot hope to accomplish anything without plentiful ingredients. I suggest you acquire some without further delay.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[alchemist_quest_giver.GetSocietyRank] [alchemist_quest_giver.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11404;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nAre you aware that many of the greatest discoveries that have been made by the member of the Renowned Apothecary Society were made when one of our members tested [alchemist_quest_giver.GetHerHis] potions on [alchemist_quest_giver.GetHerHim]self? I encourage you to test some of yours.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[alchemist_quest_giver.GetSocietyRank] [alchemist_quest_giver.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11405;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt might be useful for you to sell some of your potions to the common people. It is a great way to both make use of your skills as an alchemist and to earn some well-deserved money.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[alchemist_quest_giver.GetSocietyRank] [alchemist_quest_giver.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11406;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt has come to my attention that you do not currently possess a proper alchemical laboratory. I wonder how you intend to achieve great things as a member of the Renowned Apothecary Society without one, and encourage you to correct this oversight at the first possible opportunity.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[alchemist_quest_giver.GetSocietyRank] [alchemist_quest_giver.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_11407;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\n[infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] is a pompous, featherbrained scoundrel – you know it to be true, [Root.GetSisterBrother]! It is time for [infiltration_target.GetHerHim] to pay for [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] sins. Let us ruin [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] laboratory and steal [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] secrets!\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[alchemist_quest_giver.GetSocietyRank] [alchemist_quest_giver.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_11407;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nMy friend, we have a common nemesis. You know of whom I speak – the despicable idiot [infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]! The thought of [infiltration_target.GetHerHim] being a member of our respectable society... it makes me sick! Let us ruin [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] laboratory and steal [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] secrets!\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[alchemist_quest_giver.GetSocietyRank] [alchemist_quest_giver.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_SOH_11407;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\n[infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] is a greedy, slothful idiot who deserves none of the riches in [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] possession. What do you say, [Root.GetSisterBrother] – shall we raid [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] laboratory and claim that which should be ours?\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[alchemist_quest_giver.GetSocietyRank] [alchemist_quest_giver.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11408;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt might be a good idea for you to conduct a laboratory experiment. It is often a safer way to get results than experimenting on yourself would be, and the knowledge obtained might be invaluable.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[alchemist_quest_giver.GetSocietyRank] [alchemist_quest_giver.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11409;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nHave you considered maybe offering one of the criminals currently imprisoned by you their freedom in exchange for their contributions to your studies? I am sure you could come up with some potions to test on them, and as long as they volunteer there should be no complaints regardless of what the outcome is.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[alchemist_quest_giver.GetSocietyRank] [alchemist_quest_giver.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11410;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nThe true test of an alchemist's skills is brewing an immortality potion. Most fail, of course, but perhaps one as skilled as you might succeed...\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[alchemist_quest_giver.GetSocietyRank] [alchemist_quest_giver.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11411;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nWord has reached me that your recent self-experimentation has yielded some new insights. I hope they serve you well in your future endeavours.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[alchemist_quest_giver.GetSocietyRank] [alchemist_quest_giver.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11411;Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11412;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nWord has reached me that you have not achieved much from your recent self-experimentation. Perhaps next time you should consider increasing the dosage, or using the proper ingredients?\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[alchemist_quest_giver.GetSocietyRank] [alchemist_quest_giver.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11412;I need to do better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11413;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI have been informed that you recently had great success selling alchemical potions, which pleases me and doubtlessly pleases the rest of the Renowned Apothecary Society.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[alchemist_quest_giver.GetSocietyRank] [alchemist_quest_giver.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11413;Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11414;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI have been informed that your recent attempt to sell alchemical potions did not go well. I wish you better luck in the future.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[alchemist_quest_giver.GetSocietyRank] [alchemist_quest_giver.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11414;I need to do better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11415_normal;Though it might perhaps not be as good as some might desire, my alchemical laboratory will hopefully help me progress far as a member of the Renowned Apothecary Society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11415_rich;With a fully equipped and operational alchemical laboratory at my disposal, I will have no difficulties conducting laboratory experiments in the future, which doubtlessly will help me progress far as a member of the Renowned Apothecary Society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11415;I wonder what I will discover...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11416;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI have heard that your recent laboratory experiment went quite well. I hope the knowledge you obtained will be put to good use in the future.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[alchemist_quest_giver.GetSocietyRank] [alchemist_quest_giver.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11416;Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_11417;I need to do better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11418;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIf what I have been told is correct you obtained a number of insights thanks to [prisoner_experimented_upon.GetBestName] volunteering as your test subject. It truly is impressive what some people will agree to in exchange for their freedom...\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[alchemist_quest_giver.GetSocietyRank] [alchemist_quest_giver.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11418;Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11419;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIf what I have been told is correct you did not learn much after convincing [prisoner_experimented_upon.GetBestName] to volunteer as your test subject. I wish you better luck with your next experiment.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[alchemist_quest_giver.GetSocietyRank] [alchemist_quest_giver.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11419;I need to do better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11420;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI doubted the reports at first, but you have actually done it! A true immortality potion, brewed in my lifetime! Let none doubt your skill as an alchemist, and let all members of the Renowned Apothecary Society know that your skills truly are what they should aspire to match!\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[alchemist_quest_giver.GetSocietyRank] [alchemist_quest_giver.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11420;To be honest, I almost didn't believe it either!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11421;Most esteemed [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nMy spies have yet not found the exact location of the entrance to [infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s laboratory. You need not worry, friend, for they have some promising leads. We will just have to be patient.By my hand and seal,\n[infiltration_companion.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11421;They will have all the time they need!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_11422;The only thing that betrays the entrance to [infiltration_target.GetBestName]'s hidden laboratory is the guards patrolling back an forth in front of what looks like an unremarkable bookshelf. They will need to be dealt with before the laboratory can be entered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_11422;The unremarkable door that supposedly leads to [infiltration_target.GetBestName]'s hidden laboratory is heavily guarded, and the guards will need to be dealt with before I can get inside with [infiltration_companion.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_SOH_11422;While [infiltration_target.GetBestName]'s laboratory is not hard to find, it is not without guards. Before I can make my way inside with [infiltration_companion.GetBestName] we will need to get past then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11422;Every [Root.GetManWoman] has [Root.GetHerHis] price...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11422;I could put something in their drink to make them fall asleep!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11422;[infiltration_companion.GetBestName] will distract them while I make my way inside!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_11422;I don't think we can get past them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_11423;As expected, the guards are receptive to my suggestion that perhaps they might find themselves busy elsewhere in exchange for a purse of gold, and I and [infiltration_companion.GetBestName] make our way into [infiltration_target.GetBestName]'s laboratory as soon as the guards depart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_11423;I create a potion that should put the guards into a deep slumber easily enough, and [infiltration_companion.GetBestName] manages to slip it into the refreshments that are brought to them without too much trouble. Before long, the guards are asleep and we can make our way into [infiltration_target.GetBestName]'s laboratory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11423;Destroy all you can while I search for valuables!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11423;I will destroy all I can while you look for valuables!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11423;Help me look for [infiltration_target.GetBestName]'s valuables!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_11423;Together we will destroy it all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11424;Though I create a potion that should put the guards into a deep slumber without any difficulties [infiltration_companion.GetBestName] manages to spill it all while trying to get it into the refreshments that are to be brought to the guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11424;Well, I guess that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11425;[infiltration_companion.GetBestName] manages to draw the guards off, and I slip into [infiltration_target.GetBestName]'s laboratory while they are distracted. On my own, I will need to choose between doing damange and stealing valuable ingredients or items.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11425;I will steal what I can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11425;I will destroy what I can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11426;[infiltration_companion.GetBestName] attempts to distract the guards, but they do not leave the entrance to [infiltration_target.GetBestName]'s laboratory and instead send a runner to bring reinforcements. It is clear that we will not be able to get inside the laboratory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11426;We need to leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_11427;Just as I am about to pour acid over [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s notes, the door opens behind me. I whirl around and find myself facing none other but the guards. Our eyes lock for a moment before I drop the acid and run, but it is pointless. Despite the lingering effects of the sleeping potion, they are still faster than me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_11427;Just as I am about to pour acid over [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s notes, the door opens behind me. I whirl around and find myself staring into the panicked eyes of [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName]. A split second later, I notice the guards holding [infiltration_companion.GetHerHim]. 'Run!' [infiltration_companion.GetSheHe] shouts, but it is too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_SOH_11427;My hands are deep in one of [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s big ingredient chests when the door opens behind me. I whirl around and find myself facing none other but the guards. Our eyes lock for a moment before I drop the acid and run, but it is pointless. Despite the lingering effects of the potion, they are still faster than me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_SOH_11427;My hands are deep in one of [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s big ingredient chests when the door opens behind me. I whirl around and find myself staring into the panicked eyes of [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName]. A split second later, I notice the guards holding [infiltration_companion.GetHerHim]. 'Run!' [infiltration_companion.GetSheHe] shouts, but it is too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11427;No, no, no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11428;It seems like my guards have caught a couple of ugly fishes! Apparently [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName], along with [From.GetHerHis] accomplice [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName], made an attempt to enter my laboratory and steal my secrets. This insult cannot go unanswered...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11428;I will release them if they share their secrets...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11428;Perhaps they will do as future test subjects...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11429;I have reached the point where I am willing to shamelessly beg for water when the guards drag me from my cell. I must have fainted, for the next thing I see is [From.GetFirstName]'s scornful face! 'Well, well, well... My guards have caught one laughable crook, indeed!' After some further insults, [From.GetSheHe] offers me my freedom in exchange for my most secret alchemical knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11429;I guess I have no choice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11429;You will never have my secrets!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11430;I barely recognized [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] as they dragged [From.GetHerHim] towards me. A few days in the dungeons does that to people, I hear. I am sure I could have asked for [From.GetHerHis] firstborn, so eager was [From.GetSheHe] to have [From.GetHerHis] freedom. [From.GetFirstName] filled notebook after notebook under my stern gaze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11430;Now don't do it again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11431;I barely recognized [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] as they dragged [From.GetHerHim] towards me. A few days in the dungeons does that to people, I hear. It seems like [From.GetSheHe] enjoyed [From.GetHerHis] cell, however, for when I told [From.GetHerHim] of my generous offer, I got nothing but insults and curses in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11431;Test subject it is, then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11432;I have reached the point where I am willing to shamelessly beg for water when the guards drag me from my cell. I must have fainted, for the next thing I see is [From.GetFirstName]'s scornful face! 'Well, well, well... My guards have caught one laughable crook, indeed! I just wanted to have a look at you before they throw away the key...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11432;I have a bad feeling about this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_11433;Who knew the laboratory of [infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] would be such a treasure trove? In addition to some rare ingredients and a few items which will fetch good coin in the shadier parts of [Root.Capital.GetName], I came across a most interesting text!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_11433;My search has been most rewarding. [infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s ingredient cabinet has a fine assortment of substances and I have found several nuggets of precious metal. My share of the spoils will be a fine addition to my own laboratory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_SOH_11433;For all [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] talk and boasting, I expected more than this. Or, perhaps, [infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] is more paranoid than I thought. In any case, I cannot find anything of great value. At least these nuggets of metal will sell for a few coins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11433;A fine addition to my collection!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11433;Useful enough, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11433;Better than nothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_11434;If I ever find out who broke into my laboratory, I will kill that vile crook! Not only have my ingredient cabinet and metal collection been pilfered, but my most valued text is gone! My most divine knowledge, my deepest secrets! May the thief live in interesting times!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_11434;If I ever find out who broke into my laboratory, I will kill that vile crook! Not only has the thief laid its dirty hands on my precious metals, but my ingredient cabinet has been ransacked also. The culprit must be another member of the Renowned Apothecary Society!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_SOH_11434;I should really look over the security of my lab. Last night, some vile person snuck past the guards, but luckily nothing of major value was stolen. Either the thief had no idea of how valuable my ingredients and books are, or they were too dumb to find them. The precious metals will cost a fair bit to replace, though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_11435;[infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] should really hide [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] more volatile ingredients better! Within half an hour I have compiled enough materials to craft a decent explosive. Considering the amount this should be enough to ruin the laboratory. I carefully rig things to explode and run.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_11435;Thankfully, a laboratory is not particularly hard to sabotage. The place is full of acids, volatile substances and old tomes dry as bones. While I do not feel confident enough to risk a great fire, I heave the texts into the furnace and set the ablaze!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_SOH_11435;[infiltration_target.GetSocietyRank] [infiltration_target.GetFirstName] should really hide [infiltration_target.GetHerHis] more volatile ingredients better! Within half an hour I have compiled enough materials to craft a decent explosive. I assemble the parts ever so slowly because my hands will not stop shaking. Just as I am about to perform the last step, I drop a vial. I freeze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11435;Nothing but ashes will remain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11435;It will do some damage...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11435;That could have been-!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_11436;If I ever find out who broke into my laboratory, I will kill that vile crook! I woke last night as the whole keep shook violently. It seems like someone entered my laboratory and set off an explosion! Luckily, no lives were harmed, but my laboratory is in ruins. There is nothing to save.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_11436;If I ever find out who broke into my laboratory, I will kill that vile crook! It seems as if I have made an enemy, for the intruder focused on destruction rather than theft. Acid has been poured on floors and across work surfaces, pots and glass have been shattered and, worst of all, my furnace is filled with the blackened pages of burnt books!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_SOH_11436;I am not sure whether I should be disturbed or amused! This morning, a charred corpse was discovered in my laboratory. Apparently the crook broke in to sabotage my work but managed to kill [From.GetHerselfHimself] in a botched attempt to craft some kind of explosive. I examined the body and the culprit was none other than [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.Society.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11436;A temporary setback!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11436;A fitting end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_11438;I find [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] with [From.GetHerHis] hands deep in a big ingredients chest. Our eyes meet and I nod. It is time to go. [From.GetFirstName] stuff a few more vials and nuggets of metal into [From.GetHerHis] satchel before running after me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_11438;I follow the trail of overturned chests and broken vials until I find [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName]. I gesture for [From.GetHerHim] to come with me – it is time to go. [From.GetSheHeCap] stuffs [From.GetHerHis] pockets with a few nearby tools before running after me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11438;Anything for me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11438;Good job!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11440;As I close my satchel, I hear a loud crash from the other room. As I peek through the doorway, the scene before me is impressive. The warm light of [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName]'s torch illuminates the destruction. Overturned tables, torn books and smashed instruments. I nod appreciatively.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11440;Time to leave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11441;As I reach for a nearby tome, a terrifying roar sweeps through the laboratory and the floor shudders underneath my feet. [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] must have set of an explosion. There is no time look for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11441;I need to leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11442;Once we have left the laboratory far behind us, [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] and I collapse, two bundles of sweaty and shivering limbs. We did it. We really did it, and we got away with it, too! As the laugh erupts from my lips, my body finally relaxes. Next to me, [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] heavy breathing turns into a merry chuckle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11442;We sure showed [infiltration_target.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_11421_TT;As soon as the spies of §Y[infiltration_companion.GetTitledFirstName]§! has located the entrance, you will depart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11428_TT;[From.GetBestName] sees fit to refuse your generous offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
