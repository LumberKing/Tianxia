EVTDESC_SOH_4201;With the Tohoku region once more at peace it is time to decide what to do with the land I have acquired as part of the peace deal. If I'm not keeping it, I should also withdraw from the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4201;The land belongs to Fujiwara Kiyohira!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4201;The land belongs to Fujiwara Kiyohira!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4201;The land belongs to the Kiyohara clan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4201;The land belongs to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_4201;The land belongs to the Regent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_4201;The land belongs to the Chrysanthemum Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4202;Despite my assistance during the war and my rightful claim it seems like [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to declare that Mutsu is the rightful property of Fujiwara Kiyohira. Maybe I should dispute this by force of arms?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4202;No, there shall be peace...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4202;Summon my warriors! We march to Mutsu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4203;Though it was unclear at first if [From.GetBestName] would see fit to accept my decision to give Mutsu to Fujiwara Kiyohira [From.GetSheHe] seems to have accepted my decision and has agreed to enter into an agreement regarding a formal truce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4203;My work here is done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4204;It seems [From.GetBestName] is unwilling to accept the fact that Mutsu rightfully belongs to Fujiwara Kiyohira and my decision to give it to him, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to declare war to press [From.GetHerHis] claim on the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4204;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4205;Though I initially feared that [From.GetBestName] would have seen fit to keep Mutsu or to hand it off to someone else I have learned that [From.GetSheHe] is prepared to hand it over to me, recognizing my legal claim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4205;I am glad [From.GetSheHe] saw reason!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4206;I have just received word from the Tohoku region that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has seen fit to turn over Mutsu to [From.GetBestName] following the end of the Northern Disturbance, which apparently is agreeable to all involved parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4206;That's good news, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4206;I don't care about the north!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4207;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName] was not particularly interested to learn that I had been given control of the Tohoku region as a whole. If [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in what happens here, do I really want to remain an imperial subject?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4207;I am loyal to the Chrysanthemum Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4207;I will create my own realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4208;Despite my assistance in the war and my rightful claim it seems like [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to declare that [From.GetSheHe] should remain in control of Mutsu to ensure a lasting peace. Maybe I should dispute this by force of arms?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4208;No, there shall be peace...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4208;Summon my warriors! We march to Mutsu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4209;I intially feared that [From.GetBestName] would oppose my decision to retain control over Mutsu, but it seems [From.GetSheHe] has seen reason as [From.GetSheHe] has let it be known that [From.GetSheHe] is willing to sign a treaty stipulating a lasting truce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4209;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4210;It seems [From.GetBestName] views [From.GetHerHis] personal glory as more important than what is best for the Chrysanthemum Throne, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] has refused to accept my decision to retain control over Mutsu and has declared war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4210;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4211;[From.GetBestName] has finally secured peace in the Tohoku region, and instead of giving Mutsu to one of the claimants or keeping it for [From.GetHerselfHimself] [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to turn over the land to me so that I may distribute it as I see fit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4211;If only all subjects were this loyal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4212;To my great surprise, it seems [FromFrom.GetBestName] has seen fit to turn over Mutsu to [From.GetBestName] following the end of the Northern Disturbance. It would be seen as treasonous to object to this peace settlement, but I should not forget this slight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4212;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] should have given it to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4213;Though it seemed quite unlikely at first I have managed to come out ahead in the Northern Disturbance, and now I control the Tohoku region. Since the region is at peace I doubt the Chrysanthemum Throne will object.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4213;I think this is quite satisfactory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4214;I have just received word from the Tohoku region that the Northern Disturbance has come to an end, with [From.GetBestName] being the victor. [From.GetSheHeCap] is now in firm control of the Tohoku region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4214;That's good news, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4214;The north is irrelevant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4215;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName] was not particularly interested to learn that I control the Tohoku region as a whole due to my recent victory. If [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in what happens here, do I really need to remain an imperial subject?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4215;I am loyal to the Chrysanthemum Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4215;I will create my own realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4216;With the Tohoku region finally at peace I need to decide whether I wish to remain in the region or if I should hand it over to someone else and focus on other matters elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4216;I will give the north to Fujiwara Kiyohira!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4216;I will keep the north!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4216;I will give the north to the Regent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4216;I will give the north to the Chrysanthemum Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4217;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to recognize my rightful claim to the Tohoku region following the end of the Northern Disturbance and that [From.GetSheHe] will depart the region, leaving it in my capable hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4217;This will surely please everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4218;I have just received word from the Tohoku region that the Northern Disturbance has come to an end, with [From.GetBestName] being granted control of the region following [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4218;That's good news, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4218;The north is irrelevant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4219;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName] was not particularly interested to learn that I control the Tohoku region as a whole. If [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in what happens here, do I really need to remain an imperial subject?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4219;I am loyal to the Chrysanthemum Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4219;I will create my own realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4220;Despite previous assurances to do exactly that [From.GetBestName] has not seen fit to give me control of the Tohoku region following [From.GetHerHis] recent victory in the Northern Disturbance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4220;I won't forget this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4221;[From.GetBestName] has finally secured peace in the Tohoku region, and [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to turn over the land [From.GetSheHe] obtained to me so that I may distribute it as I see fit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4221;If only all subjects were this loyal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4222;To my great surprise, it seems [FromFrom.GetBestName] has seen fit to turn over Mutsu to [From.GetBestName] following the end of the Northern Disturbance. It would be seen as treasonous to object to this peace settlement, but I should not forget this slight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_4225;I am loyal to the Chrysanthemum Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4225;I will create my own realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4226;With my realm finally at peace again the warrior bands that came to my aid are no longer needed, and it is time for them to disperse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4226;I can bring them back if I need them again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
