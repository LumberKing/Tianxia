EVTDESC_SOH_5632;The sacrifices to heaven and earth are ready, but in order for it to be possible for them to commence I need to formally proclaim the name of my new imperial dynasty. I could elect to use a name that has been used to name one of the great dynasties of the past, even if the dynasty in question came to an end, or I could elect to use a different name to perhaps signify that my dynasty will not end in the same fashion.\n\nWhat will the name of the new imperial dynasty be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5633;The Mandate of Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5633;Word is spreading far and wide that [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, now claims to possess the Mandate of Heaven, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] now rules a bureaucratic realm that controls the Middle Kingdom itself. [From.GetSheHeCap] has also let it be known that [From.GetHerHis] imperial dynasty will be known as the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] dynasty, and has proclaimed the start of a new imperial era.\n\nWhether [From.GetBestName]'s claim will turn out to be validated or not in the end will be for the history books to decide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
