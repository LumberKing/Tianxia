EVTDESC_SOH_3601;I have decided to embark on a pilgrimage to a significant site for the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. It will doubtlessly be a long journey, but I think that it will be a worthwhile endeavor, and doubtlessly others belonging to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith will look on me more favorably once I return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3601;I will prove my devotion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3602;The kami are everywhere, and so are their servants and shrines. However, a pilgrimage needs to be to a significant location for anyone to take it seriously, and that gives me a smaller number of options.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3602;I will visit the court of the [the_tenno.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3602;I will visit the grand shrine at Ise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3602;I will walk the Kumano route!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3602;I will visit Mount Fuji!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3603;There are certain sites in Japan to make a pilgrimage to, and those are generally where pilgrims like me would go, but as the Buddhist faith is rather widespread there are of course also other sites to be found elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3603;I will visit the many sites in Shikoku!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3603;I will visit Mount Koya!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3603;I will head outside Japan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3604;It is time to leave on my pilgrimage. Though it is possible that the journey will be both long and difficult I feel that I have made adequate preparations, and there is no reason to delay things any further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3604;I will prove my faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3606;A pilgrim is generally expected to be an ascetic during their pilgrimage, and thus should avoid various immoral actions. I have of course been considering adhering to this during my pilgrimage, but perhaps it would be worse to try and fail than to not try at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3606;Ascetism is commendable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3606;Ascetism isn't for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3607;One day during my pilgrimage I encounter a wandering priest devoted to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. He inquires about my pilgrimage so far and is quite pleased when I tell him that I am making an effort to be ascetic, telling you that it is commendable and something that many struggle with..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3607;I will be a better person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3608;After making the decision to try to be ascetic during my pilgrimage I have been considering how I am living my life in general, and I have concluded that one of my flaws is that I am rather proud. I have decided that this is something I should put behind me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3608;I will be a better person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3609;After making the decision to try to be ascetic during my pilgrimage I have been considering how I am living my life in general, and I have concluded that one of my flaws is that I am rather gluttonous. I have decided that this is something I should put behind me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3609;I will be a better person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3610;After making the decision to try to be ascetic during my pilgrimage I have been considering how I am living my life in general, and I have concluded that one of my flaws is that I am rather lustful. I have decided that this is something I should put behind me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3610;I will be a better person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3611;After making the decision to try to be ascetic during my pilgrimage I have been considering how I am living my life in general. Though I would not have said that I am overly proud, I have still concluded that I definitely could be a bit more humble, and I think I have taken a step in the right direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3611;I made the right choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3612;After making the decision to try to be ascetic during my pilgrimage I have been considering how I am living my life in general. Though I would not have said that I am overly gluttonous, I have still concluded that I definitely could be a bit more temperate, and I think I have taken a step in the right direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3612;I made the right choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3613;After making the decision to try to be ascetic during my pilgrimage I have been considering how I am living my life in general. Though I would not have said that I could be considered particularly lustful, I have still concluded that I definitely could be a bit more chaste, and I think I have taken a step in the right direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3613;I made the right choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3614;Though I decided that I wanted to be more ascetic during my pilgrimage I have not really been making much of an effort, and after a while on the road I conclude that I will not be able to really devote myself to this. It is bit shameful to know that I failed to do the right thing, even if only I know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3614;At least I tried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3615;One day during my pilgrimage I encounter a wandering priest devoted to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. He inquires about my pilgrimage so far, and when he learns just how little effort I have put into being ascetic he gets upset and calls me out on not being as devout as I should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3615;At least I tried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3616;I decided that being ascetic during my pilgrimage would not be a good idea, and though a pilgrimage is a time to reflect on my faith and try to better myself I have instead been reconsidering how strictly I should follow its teachings, concluding that it would not necessarily be wrong for me to be a bit more proud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3616;I must be true to myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3617;I decided that being ascetic during my pilgrimage would not be a good idea, and though a pilgrimage is a time to reflect on my faith and try to better myself I have instead been reconsidering how strictly I should follow its teachings, concluding that it would not necessarily be wrong for me to be a bit more gluttonous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3617;I must be true to myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3618;I decided that being ascetic during my pilgrimage would not be a good idea, and though a pilgrimage is a time to reflect on my faith and try to better myself I have instead been reconsidering how strictly I should follow its teachings, concluding that it would not necessarily be wrong for me to be a bit more lustful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3618;I must be true to myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3619;I decided that being ascetic during my pilgrimage would not be a good idea, and though a pilgrimage is a time to reflect on my faith and try to better myself I have instead been reconsidering how strictly I should follow its teachings, concluding that it would not necessarily be wrong for me to be a bit less humble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3619;I must be true to myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3620;I decided that being ascetic during my pilgrimage would not be a good idea, and though a pilgrimage is a time to reflect on my faith and try to better myself I have instead been reconsidering how strictly I should follow its teachings, concluding that it would not necessarily be wrong for me to be a bit less temperate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3620;I must be true to myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3621;I decided that being ascetic during my pilgrimage would not be a good idea, and though a pilgrimage is a time to reflect on my faith and try to better myself I have instead been reconsidering how strictly I should follow its teachings, concluding that it would not necessarily be wrong for me to be a bit less chaste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3621;I must be true to myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3622;I knew that there possibly would be those that would be unhappy when I made the decision not to focus on ascetism during my pilgrimage, and I have been worrying a bit about someone lecturing me about it, but as far as I can tell nobody has seemed to care about me being less than ascetic during my pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3622;It was the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3623;One day on the road I come across a crippled dog with only three legs. It appears to have trouble walking, and whimpers from time to time. Though I know that I am supposed to refrain from killing during a pilgrimage, it is perhaps the lesser evil in a situation like this, since the dog clearly is suffering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3623;I won't take its life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3623;I can give it a quick death...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3623;It doesn't know suffering... yet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3624;The dog follows me for a while despite having trouble walking, and it makes me feel rather sad that I cannot help it in any way. However, as I reach the next village one of the villagers takes pity on the dog and declares that he will adopt it and do what he can for it, which certainly is a welcome development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3624;It is good that someone cares!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3625;Leaving the crippled dog behind I find myself reflecting on my normal approach to things, which often is violent, and perhaps a bit more cruel than it has to be. Though I would not go as far as to say that it is always wrong to use violence I should really try to be less cruel in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3625;I should be kinder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3626;I leave the crippled dog behind but find my thoughts returning to it several times during the following days. Though I could not have brought it with me I feel that there have been other situations in the past where I could have been a bit more helpful, and I decide that I should focus more on kindness in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3626;Kindness is the right path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3627;I leave the crippled dog behind but find my thoughts returning to it several times during the following days. It was unfortunate that I could not help it, but the only option I saw was to give it the mercy of a quick death, which would have been ever worse than leaving it since I should not kill during a pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3627;Poor dog!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3628;I draw my sword and approach the dog, striking swiftly and killing it before it can react. Unfortunately for me, another pilgrim is walking by as it happens, and he sees fit to berate me, claiming that it is more important for me to focus on my pilgrimage and what is proper during that than anything else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3628;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3629;There was a time where I would not have seen fit to make the suffering of an animal shorter and perhaps even would have seen fit to draw it out, but I have decided that that is behind me and grant the dog a swift death. Though I would not go as far as to renounce violence I feel I could be less cruel in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3629;That was a kindness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3630;I draw my sword and approach the dog, striking swiftly and killing it before it can react. Though killing is not something I am supposed to do during a pilgrimage, letting an animal suffer needlessly seems worse to me. It is perhaps not a sentiment everyone would agree with, but in this particular instance I do not care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3630;That was a kindness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3631;I draw my sword and approach the dog, striking swiftly and killing it before it can react. With that done, I wipe my sword clean and sheathe it once more, then continue on my way. Mu pilgrimage is far from over, and I cannot afford to be distracted or delayed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3631;That was a kindness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3632;The crippled dog suspects nothing as I approach, and a precise cut with my sword severs one of the tendons in one of its remaining legs. It lets out a sound that is half a growl and half a whimper as it attempts to escape, but I ensure that that is not an option, and I spend the rest of the day inflicting further tortures on it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3632;That was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3633;The crippled dog suspects nothing as I approach, and a precise cut with your sword severs one of the tendons in one of its remaining legs. It lets out a sound that is half a growl and half a whimper as it attempts to escape, but I ensure that that is not an option, and I spend the rest of the day inflicting further tortures on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3633;That ended too soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3634;I have been told that a pilgrim following the [Root.Religion.GetName] religion should avoid saying anything that could be considered immoral during the pilgrimage, and I have tried to behave acoordingly. However, in one village I come across an attractive villager, and I start questioning this prohibition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3634;I can say some immoral things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3634;It is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3635;The attractive villager I made the comment do did appreciate what I say and tells me that I should know better than to engage in such behavior during a pilgrimage before leaving. Though word of what happened hopefully will not spread I still feel a bit humiliated by the experience, and I am convinced that I made a mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3635;It was just a joke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3636;The villager ignored my immoral words and leaves without comment. I am not certain what they thought of what I said, but it is quite clear that it was not as effective as I would have liked, and perhaps it was a mistake to not adhere to the supposed rules for a pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3636;That could have gone worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3637;The [pilgrims_lover.GetManWoman] is quite receptive to my words, and [pilgrims_lover.GetSheHe] gives me a smile and suggests that perhaps the two of us should head somewhere more private to perhaps to engage in certain other activities that might be of interest to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3637;But of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3637;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3638;[pilgrims_lover.GetBestName] and I spend the night in each other's arms, and when the morning comes and I am about to leave [pilgrims_lover.GetSheHe] asks me whether the two of us will meet again. I cannot bring [pilgrims_lover.GetHerHim] with we on my journey, of course, but that does not necessarily mean we must be apart forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3638;I have a place for you at home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3638;I don't want to see you again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3639;I resolve to say nothing immoral and continue on my way. A few villages later I overhear another pilgrim make immoral comments nearby, and the townspeople are quick to berate him. He is clearly humiliated by the experience, and it is likely that I made the right decision before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3639;Something to remember...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3640;Though there was a time when I would have seen fit to make immoral comments to nearly every person I thought would be receptive I have started to feel that this is something that I should put behind me, not just for the duration of the pilgrimage but perhaps forever, as I want to try to be a better person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3640;Begone, lust!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3641;I continue on my way and reflect on what I choose not to do a bit during the following days. Though I previously have not felt overly strongly on the subject of chastity I am starting to feel differently now, and I resolve to live my life in a chaste fashion from now on, as that feels quite appropriate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3641;Chastity is right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3642;I decide not to make an immoral comment and continue on my way, not feeling particularly strongly about the decision and not thinking too much about it over the course of the next few days. After all, I am on an important journey and have plenty of things to think about, and cannot afford to dwell on a small detail overly long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3642;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3643;I am aware that one of the rules pilgrims are supposed to adhere to during a pilgrimage is to abstain from alcohol, and I have been doing that so far even though I usually drink some on a somewhat frequent basis. However, one evening when I am having a meal at an inn one of the patrons there offers to buy me a drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3643;Sorry, but I don't drink!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3643;One drink won't hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3644;The patron that offered to buy me a drink seems a bit surprised by me turning down his offer, and he leaves the inn before long. After he has left some of the other patrons note that the man has made a habit of trying to trick pilgrims into drinking and that many pilgrims fail to refuse. They are evidently quite impressed by my resolve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3644;I made the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3645;I refuse the offer of a drink, and the man who offered it to me merely shrugs and goes looking for another drinking partner. Noting that their behavior becomes worse and worse during the course of the evening as they drink more and more, I decide that I made the right decision, and also that I should try to be a bit more temperate in general.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3645;Temperance is the right path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3646;I refuse the offer of a drink, and the man who offered it to me merely shrugs and goes looking for another drinking partner. The rest of the evening is uneventful, and I have a good night's sleep and a quick breakfast shortly after dawn before once more setting off on my journey, eager to reach my destination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3646;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3647;I accept the man's offer to buy me a drink, and once I start drinking I find that I have been missing it more than I thought I had. I order some more drinks after finishing the first, and decide that I really should not focus so much on temperance in the future as it simply is not worth the trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3647;I can indulge some more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3648;I accept the man's offer to buy me a drink, and drink it slowly once I receive it, intending for it to be the only drink I have. Before I have finished my drink another pilgrim enters the common room of the inn and notices that I am drinking, and he is quick to call me out for not avoiding alcohol during my pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3648;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3649;I accept the man's offer to buy me a drink, and drink it slowly once I receive it, intending for it to be the only drink I have. I have no trouble keeping that promise to myself, and the evening passes without anything notable happening. After a good night's sleep I have a quick breakfast before leaving the inn, eager to reach my destination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3649;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3650;I accept the man's offer to buy me a drink, and down in quickly after I receive it. Finding it to your taste, I order another, and then several more after that. The rest of the evening is a blur, and the next morning I wake up on the floor of the common room with a severe headache, which gets worse every time someone speaks louder than a whisper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3650;That... was a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3651;One day on the road I come across a fellow pilgrim. The woman does not look pleased to see that she has company all of a sudden, and when it becomes clear that the two of us are heading in the same direction she starts complaining about how I have ruined the pilgrimage before launching into a series of insults.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3651;I cannot let this slide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3651;I should try to de-escalate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3652;I inform the woman that she is being most unreasonable and should expect to share the road, and also tell her that she owes me an apology. She will have none of it, and an argument predictably breaks out. I am quite certain that she is the unreasonable party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3652;I am right, you are wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3653;I inform the woman that she is being most unreasonable and should expect to share the road, and also tell her that she owes me an apology. She will have none of it, and an argument predictably breaks out. A [Root.GetManWoman] of my rank should not have to endure such poor company!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3653;I deserve better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3654;I inform the woman that she is being most unreasonable and should expect to share the road, and also tell her that she owes me an apology. She will have none of it, and an argument predictably breaks out. Though I would consider myself a humble person, I deserve better than this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3654;I am not at fault!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3655;I inform the woman that she is being most unreasonable and should expect to share the road, and also tell her that she owes me an apology. She will have none of it, and an argument predictably breaks out as my patience has reached its limit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3655;I have no patience for fools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3656;I inform the woman that she is being most unreasonable and should expect to share the road, and also tell her that she owes me an apology. She will have none of it, and an argument predictably breaks out, and I feel more than justified in returning her insults.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3656;The time for kindness is over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3657;I inform the woman that she is being most unreasonable and should expect to share the road, and also tell her that she owes me an apology. She will have none of it, and an argument predictably breaks out, and I inform the woman that she will pay dearly the next time she insults me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3657;Insult me and you'll regret it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3658;I inform the woman that she is being most unreasonable and should expect to share the road, and also tell her that she owes me an apology. She will have none of it, and an argument predictably breaks out, and I see no reason to hold back when it comes to returning the insults with interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3658;Run away and cry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3659;I inform the woman that she is being most unreasonable and should expect to share the road, and also tell her that she owes me an apology. She will have none of it, and an argument predictably breaks out. Our quarrel attracts the attention of a priestess that is passing by, and she berates both of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3659;I didn't start it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3660;I inform the woman that she is being most unreasonable and should expect to share the road, and also tell her that she owes me an apology. She declares that she is unwilling to share the road with me or give me an apology, and takes off in a different direction as soon as she can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3660;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3661;I calmly explain to the woman that I am just another pilgrim and that this is the best route for me, and she listens to my words before offering me what appears to be a sincere apology. Though I felt tempted to return her insults with interest I conclude that it was the right decision to go for something more diplomatic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3661;Cruelty is uncalled for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3662;I calmly explain to the woman that I am just another pilgrim and that this is the best route for me, and she listens to my words before offering me what appears to be a sincere apology. Though I felt tempted to threaten her with violence when she insulted me I conclude that it was the right decision to go for something more diplomatic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3662;I know how to keep my temper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3663;I calmly explain to the woman that I am just another pilgrim and that this is the best route for me, and she listens to my words before offering me what appears to be a sincere apology. Though there are many that would have resorted to violence or that would have returned the insults I feel that approaching the matter with kindness was correct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3663;Kindness is the right path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3664;I calmly explain to the woman that I am just another pilgrim and that this is the best route for me, and she listens to my words before offering me what appears to be a sincere apology. Though there are many that would have resorted to violence or that would have returned the insults I feel that approaching the matter with patience was correct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3664;Patience is the right path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3665;I calmly explain to the woman that I am just another pilgrim and that this is the best route for me, and she listens to my words before offering me what appears to be a sincere apology. Though I usually would have expected a better apology, I am on a pilgrimage to better myself, and I decide to put my pride aside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3665;I should be humber!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3666;I calmly explain to the woman that I am just another pilgrim and that this is the best route for me, and she listens to my words before offering me what appears to be a sincere apology. There are those that would not have considered a mere apology acceptable after their pride was injured, but I can see how being humble is the right decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3666;Humility is the right path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3667;I calmly explain to the woman that I am just another pilgrim and that this is the best route for me, and she listens to my words before offering me what appears to be a sincere apology. Though I was rather less insistent than I usually would have been, it clearly worked out in mu favor, and I conclude that I should be less stubborn in general.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3667;Stubborness is overrated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3668;I calmly explain to the woman that I am just another pilgrim and that this is the best route for me, and she listens to my words before offering me what appears to be a sincere apology. Over the next few days I look back at some other incidents in the past and start seeing how I could have handled them more diplomatically.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3668;I know what to say now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3669;I calmly explain to the woman that I am just another pilgrim and that this is the best route for me, and though she calms down a bit she tells me that she prefers solitude even so, conceding that she could be the one to take a different route. True to her words, she elects to head off in a different direction almost immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3669;Perhaps it is for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3670;Before setting off on my pilgrimage you made the customary donations to nearby temples to prove my devotion, but even so I brought quite a bit of money on my journey. Recently, I have been considering the fact that this is not quite in line with what is expected of me during a pilgrimage, and perhaps I should make another donation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3670;I can give a bit more to charity...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3670;I have given more than enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3671;I make sure to stop by the next temple I come across to hand over a substantial amount of money to the [Root.Religion.GetName] priests found there. They are quite grateful to receive such a donation, and tell me that it is good that I saw fit to donate to charity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3671;I only did what was right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3672;I make sure to stop by the next temple I come across to hand over a substantial amount of money to the [Root.Religion.GetName] priests found there. After leaving I start considering just how much money I normally have been earning compared to how much I have been able to spend, and I conclude that I really do not need that much money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3672;Greed is overrated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3673;I make sure to stop by the next temple I come across to hand over a substantial amount of money to the [Root.Religion.GetName] priests found there. Later on I start considering whether I could donate to temples more often, and conclude that it should be rather easy to arrange that as I have more than enough money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3673;Charity is the right path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3674;I make sure to stop by the next temple I come across to hand over a substantial amount of money to the [Root.Religion.GetName] priests found there. Normally, I would consider doing so a bit beneath me, but I have decided that I should better myself during my pilgrimage and that becoming more humble is the right move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3674;Pride is a problem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3675;I make sure to stop by the next temple I come across to hand over a substantial amount of money to the [Root.Religion.GetName] priests found there. They are a bit surprised to learn that I was willing to set my own good aside, but they praise me for being humble enough to admit that I had made a mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3675;I don't mind being humble!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3676;I make sure to stop by the next temple I come across to hand over a substantial amount of money to the [Root.Religion.GetName] priests found there. They praise ,e for my kindness, and I take their words to heart and decide that from now on I should endeavor to be kind more often than I have been in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3676;I should be kind more often!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3677;I make sure to stop by the next temple I come across to hand over a substantial amount of money to the [Root.Religion.GetName] priests found there, and then leave the temple right away. I have yet to reach my destination, after all, and cannot afford to be distracted by minor things along the road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3677;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3678;I am in the middle of a discussion with a [Root.Religion.GetName] priest at a small shrine when I suddenly notice that the sun is lower on the horizon than I had thought it was. Since I am supposed to make sure that I get to my inn before dark during a pilgrimage, I might need to leave sooner rather than later, even though the priest might be upset.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3678;I must depart at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3678;I can stay a while and listen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3679;The priest is surprised at first when I interrupt him to tell him that I need to leave at once, but then he notices just how low the sun is on the horizon and tells me that he is sorry to have taken up so much of my time. Furthermore, he says that it is rather refreshing to meet a pilgrim that actually cares about adhering to the rules for a pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3679;I knew he'd understand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3680;I take my leave and hurry away from the temple, doing my best to make up for lost time. Though I normally would have taken it easy I have come to the conclusion that that is not what I really want to do, and I resolve to become less slothful in order to better myself during my pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3680;I cannot afford to rest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3681;I take my leave and hurry away from the temple, doing my best to make up for lost time. I am no stranger to working hard at times when something unexpected happens, and as I hurry towards the next village I decide that I should make an effort to always work hard from now on to try to have more time available for unforeseen issues that might arise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3681;I must work hard to succeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3682;The priest is surprised when I interrupt him and to tell him that I need to leave at once. When I tell him that it is getting late and that I need to hurry if I am to reach the next village with an inn before dark he gets annoyed and tells me that I should not have stopped in the first place if I did not think to plan ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3682;I would have thought he'd be pleased...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3683;I stay at the temple until the priest finally is done talking, at which point the sun barely is above the horizon. I am unsure whether I could reach the nearest village with an inn before dark even if I really make an effort, and I decide that it is not really worth trying and that there is nothing wrong with taking it easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3683;I can afford to relax...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3684;I stay at the temple until the priest finally is done talking, at which point the sun barely is above the horizon. Though I perhaps could have made it to the nearest village with an inn before dark if I had made an effort Iu decide that it really is not worth trying, and as I head off at a rather slow pace I decide that I need to learn to relax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3684;I can't work all the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3685;The priest keeps talking for a good while and it is almost dark before he finally stops. As I prepare to leave he takes the time to tell me that I really should have been more mindful of the fact that I needed to depart sooner. It is rather clear that he does not seem to think that the fact that he kept talking was why I remained at the temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3685;But I didn't want to upset you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3686;The priest keeps talking for a good while and it is almost dark before he finally stops. He is evidently aware of the fact that this makes it unlikely that I will reach an inn before dark as he makes sure to tell me that I need not worry about that as keeping him company and listening to him without interruption certainly justifies being out after dark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3686;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3687;It is almost dark before the priest stops talking long enough for me to leave, and I find myself racing the sunset as I hurry towards where I think that the nearest inn is located. Twilight has arrived by the time that I enter the inn, but twilight is not the same as darkness, so I managed to get there in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3687;I barely made it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3688;I wake up well before dawn one morning and cannot fall asleep again, and I start to wonder whether it would be a good idea to set off early so that I perhaps might reach my destination sooner. I know that I technically am not supposed to leave my inn during the night during a pilgrimage unless it is unavoidable, but perhaps there are expections?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3688;An early start is right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3688;There are rules to follow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3689;I head down to the common room and eat a quick breakfast before gathering my belongings and setting off from the inn. As I depart I consider the fact that I normally would have been willing to wait patiently for things to happen, but it has at times been rather difficult, and I do not really feel that it is something I want keep doing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3689;Maybe I'm a bit impatient...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3690;I head down to the common room and eat a quick breakfast before gathering my belongings and setting off from the inn. I am no stranger to not resting when there is something to do, and looking back I can see how being a bit more diligent would have been beneficial. Since I am on a pilgrimage partially to better myself, I resolve to become more diligent from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3690;I must not waste time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3691;I head down to the common room and eat a quick breakfast before gathering my belongings and setting off from the inn. Normally, I would have welcomed any excuse to take it easy, but I have started to come to the conclusion that that is often detrimental, and I resolve to be less slothful in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3691;I must work harder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3692;I head down to the common room and eat a quick breakfast before gathering my belongings and heading for the door. As I am about to step outside another pilgrim that has been staying at the same inn comes down the stairs and spots me, and she quickly calls me out on leaving an inn during the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3692;I can't please everyone...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3693;I head down to the common room and eat a quick breakfast before gathering my belongings and setting off from the inn. I have quite far to travel before I reach my destination, and I cannot affort to waste time, and since nobody seems to have noticed that I am breaking the rules it probably will not be anything I come to regret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3693;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3694;I decide that I should remain at the inn until dawn, as is expected of me. I spend the time reflecting on the fact that there are many things in life that I cannot control, and that that sometimes mean I have to wait on things, and I resolve to be a bit more patient moving forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3694;Good things come to those that wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3695;I decide that I should remain at the inn until dawn, as is expected of me. As I do not really have anything to do the time is not spent in a productive manner, but I find that I do not mind this as much as I had expected, and I decide that perhaps it would not be a bad idea to take it easy more often.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3695;I should not work so hard...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3696;I decide that I should remain at the inn until dawn, as is expected of me. I do not bother trying to be productive, and even though I initially planned to leave at dawn I find myself lingering at the inn for a while longer after that since I have come to feel that there really is no need to rush.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3696;I can relax more often...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3697;I decide that I should remain at the inn until dawn, as is expected of me. As I hear the other people that have stayed overnight start moving about I head down to eat a quick breakfast, and as the sun is above the horizon after I am done I gather my belongings and set off, seeing as I no longer risk breaking the rules.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3697;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3699;The Chrysanthemum Throne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3699;After a long journey I have finally arrived at my destination: The court of the [the_tenno.GetTitle].\nThough I have not yet entered the august presence of [the_tenno.GetBestName] [the_tenno.GetHerselfHimself] and thus have not beheld the actual Chrysanthemum Throne I still feel a sense of awe, and judging by the looks on the faces of the other pilgrims I have seen I am not the only one that is impressed.\nAside from briefly being stopped by the guards so that they could confirm my identity and my purpose, none of the locals have really paid attention to me yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3699;I need to be on my best behavior!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3700;I could spend weeks or even months wandering the court of the [the_tenno.GetTitle] without getting to see [the_tenno.GetHerHim] or the Chrysanthemum Throne itself, and none would fault me for not bothering [the_tenno.GetHerHim], but I have travelled far and am not just any common pilgrim, so perhaps it would be possible to get an audience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3700;I will try to get an audience!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3700;I'd rather not bother [the_tenno.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3701;One of the lesser court officials informs me that [From.GetBestName] has arrived at my court on a pilgrimage and that [From.GetSheHe] is requesting an audience with me. It is unclear if there is a particular reason for this audience or not, and it is not out of line to ask for an audience, but it is up to me wether I want to accept the request or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3701;I don't have time for this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3701;I can spare the time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3701;We can meet... in the dungeon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3702;A messenger arrives to inform me that the [the_tenno.GetTitle] is busy with affairs of state for the time being and cannot spare the time to grant me the audience I seek. The messenger further suggests that it is in everyone's interests for me not to try again later, as the [the_tenno.GetBestName] does not enjoy repeating [the_tenno.GetHerselfHimself].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3702;Unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3703;A messenger arrives to inform me that the [the_tenno.GetTitle] has seen fit to grant me the audience I seek. As [the_tenno.GetSheHe] is a bit busy at the moment and was taken by surprise by the request I will have to wait a short while, but I had not expected [the_tenno.GetBestName] to be free at a moment's notice, so this does not really bother me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3703;That's good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3704;A messenger arrives to inform me that the [the_tenno.GetTitle] has seen fit to grant me the audience I seek. He tells me to follow him, and as I do so a number of guards fall in all around me. I do not pay much attention to them or where we are going, and consequently I am surprised when the guards lead me to the dungeons and toss me into a cell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3704;It was a trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3705;I am led into the august presence of [the_tenno.GetBestName] [the_tenno.GetHerselfHimself] without much delay. Knowing what is expected of me, I quickly drop to me knees in front of [the_tenno.GetHerHim], but [the_tenno.GetSheHe] quickly tells me to rise and asks if there was anything in particular I wanted to discuss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3705;I am here to express my appreciation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3705;I ask for your blessing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3705;I just wanted to talk to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3706;I inform the [the_tenno.GetBestName] that I wish to express your appreciation for [the_tenno.GetHerHis] rule and [the_tenno.GetHerHim] in person, as it is easier to make it clear that I am being sincere if I do not do it in writing. [the_tenno.GetBestName] considers me words for a moment and then thanks me for my kind words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3706;I think that went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3707;[From.GetBestName] appears before me and falls to [From.GetHerHis] knees, as would be expected, and I bid [From.GetHerHim] to rise and inquire as to why [From.GetSheHe] asked for an audience. [From.GetSheHeCap] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] is there to express [From.GetHerHis] appreciation of me and my rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3707;I am rather great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3708;[From.GetBestName] appears before me and falls to [From.GetHerHis] knees, as would be expected, and I bid [From.GetHerHim] to rise and inquire as to why [From.GetSheHe] asked for an audience. [From.GetSheHeCap] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] is there to ask for my blessing, and that of the kami, on [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetHerHis] rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3708;A blessing? Sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3708;A blessing? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3709;[the_tenno.GetBestName] considers my request for a moment before telling me that [the_tenno.GetSheHe] and the kami look favorably on me and my rule and that I definitely am worthy of their blessing. [the_tenno.GetSheHeCap] further tells me that the fact that I saw fit to ask speaks highly of me, as it shows humility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3709;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3710;[the_tenno.GetBestName] considers my request for a moment before telling me that [the_tenno.GetSheHe] and the kami do not look favorably on me and my rule and that I definitely am unworthy of their blessing. [the_tenno.GetSheHeCap] further tells me that I will need to work quite hard if I am to ever prove myself worthy of such an honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3710;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3711;I tell [the_tenno.GetBestName] that I wished to converse with [the_tenno.GetHerHim] on anything that [the_tenno.GetSheHe] might want to talk about as I feel that the two of us might get along. [the_tenno.GetSheHeCap] is a bit surprised, but by the time I depart it is clear that both of us have enjoyed spending time together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3711;We both had a good time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3712;[From.GetBestName] appears before me and falls to [From.GetHerHis] knees, as would be expected, and I bid [From.GetHerHim] to rise and inquire as to why [From.GetSheHe] asked for an audience. [From.GetSheHeCap] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] wished to talk to me for a bit to see if we might get along, and it turns out that we do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3712;We both had a good time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3713;I tell [the_tenno.GetBestName] that I wished to converse with [the_tenno.GetHerHim] on anything that [the_tenno.GetSheHe] might want to talk about as I feel that the two of us might get along. [the_tenno.GetSheHeCap] is a bit surprised, but agrees to speak to me for a while. Sadly, we do not get along at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3713;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3714;[From.GetBestName] appears before me and falls to [From.GetHerHis] knees, as would be expected, and I bid [From.GetHerHim] to rise and inquire as to why [From.GetSheHe] asked for an audience. [From.GetSheHeCap] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] wished to talk to me for a bit to see if we might get along. It turns out that we do not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3714;Leave my presence at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3716;I have been spending some time walking around and talking to both other pilgrims and various officials at the court of the [the_tenno.GetBestName], and I feel certain that as long as we keep our faith in the kami and work together we will be able to achieve anything, and any doubts that I once might have felt have been dispersed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3716;My faith has never been stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3717;I have been spending some time walking around and talking to both other pilgrims and various officials at the court of the [the_tenno.GetBestName], and though I expected everyone here to be devout it has become clear that that is not the case. If those near the Chrysanthemum Throne itself see no reason to honor the kami it does not speak highly of the kami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3717;It is all meaningless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3718;As I are walking around the palace of [the_tenno.GetBestName] I suddenly get a flash of inspiration and know that I have a message I must share with those around me. It might not be something that the people there will like to hear, but the words in my mind cannot be stopped, and they must be shared with those that do not yet know of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3718;THE KAMI SPEAK TO ME!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3719;A servant comes hurrying into my presence, ignoring proper protocol as she immediately begins talking to me. It becomes clear that this is justifiable as she brings word that [From.GetBestName] apparently is screaming a message that supposedly comes directly from the kami at the top of [From.GetHerHis] voice, even though the message is most questionable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3719;We must imprison this mad[From.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3719;We must make [From.GetHerHim] go away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3719;Let's just ignore it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3719;THE KAMI SPEAK TO [From.GetHerHimFullCaps]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3720;I am not really paying attention to my surroundings as I share the glorious truths that the kami have revealed to me, and thus I fail to notice the arrival of a group of guards before they are upon me. They quickly grab me and drag me away, and it is not long before I am tossed into an empty cell somewhere beneath the palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3720;The kami never mentioned this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3721;I am not really paying attention to my surroundings as I share the glorious truths that the kami have revealed to me, and thus I fail to notice the arrival of a group of guards before they are upon me. They quickly grab me and drag me to the outskirts of the palace, upon which they give me a shove to send me on my way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3721;But I spoke the truth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3722;I speak at length, sharing the glorious truths that the kami have revealed to me with all nearby. Nobody really seems to be paying attention to me, however, and eventually I am forced to conclude that ,y words have fallen on deaf ears and that I probably would be better off sharing the truth elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3722;YOU CAN'T IGNORE ME FOREVER!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3723;I speak at length, sharing the glorious truths that the kami have revealed to me with all nearby. At first, people are skeptical, but then a messenger appears to inform those present that [the_tenno.GetBestName] [the_tenno.GetHerselfHimself] bids everyone to listen to me and my glorious truths. After that, the crowd pays attention to everything I tell them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3723;I SPEAK THE TRUTH!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3724;I have spent some time at the court of [the_tenno.GetBestName] and have met many people, among them [pilgrims_friend.GetBestName], a most interesting [pilgrims_friend.GetManWoman]. The two of us have a lot in common, and I feel confident that we will find reason to meet in the future as we both have been enjoying each other's company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3724;I have a new friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3725;I have spent some time at the court of [the_tenno.GetBestName] and have met many people, among them [pilgrims_rival.GetBestName], a most irksome [pilgrims_rival.GetManWoman]. [pilgrims_rival.GetSheHeCap] has made it clear that my presence is unwelcome this close to the Chrysanthemum Throne, and that [pilgrims_rival.GetSheHe] also finds me generally disagreeable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3725;I must be on my guard against [pilgrims_rival.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3726;Though I doubtlessly could spend more time at the court of the [the_tenno.GetBestName] I have been away from home for quite a while, and it would not be prudent to delay my return any longer. It is time to begin the journey back to [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3726;I must head home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3727;The Kumano Route;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3727;I have arrived at the start of the Kumano pilgrim route, along which a number of important shrines can be found, and though I have decided not to visit the grand shrine at Ise this time I will definitely visit quite a few shrines.\nI have noticed that there are plenty of other pilgrims around, so I will likely have some company on the road from time to time, and perhaps I might come across some noteworthy people.\nRegardless of who or what I might find along the pilgrim route, I must be prepared to keep on walking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3727;I still have far to walk...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3728;After visiting a few of the shrines along the Kumano route I have noticed that the number of pilgrims on the road is much smaller than it was closer to the start of the route. Evidently, not everyone bothers to visit every shrine around the pilgrim route, and I have started to wonder if I perhaps should cut the pilgrimage short as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3728;I can stop now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3728;I can't stop early!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3729;I decide to skip as many shrines as I can get away with and take a look at a map, noticing that there are various possible shortcuts that I can make good use of. Over the next few days I start to fell that I made the right decision, and decide that working hard is not right for me after all. From now on, I want to take it easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3729;I should take it easy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3730;I decide to skip as many shrines as I can get away with and take a look at a map, noticing that there are various possible shortcuts that I can make good use of. I spend the next couple of days reflecting on how much I tend to work, and I conclude that I really should learn to relax more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3730;I can't work all the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3731;I decide to skip as many shrines as I can get away with and take a look at a map, noticing that there are various possible shortcuts that I can make good use of. As I walk along the much shorter route I decide that I have made the right choice as I really do not feel that there is much to be gained from faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3731;Faith has its limits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3732;I decide to skip as many shrines as I can get away with and take a look at a map, noticing that there are various possible shortcuts that I can make good use of. I have not really considered myself a strong believer of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith at any point, and when I consider things a bit more I conclude that it simply is not important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3732;The kami are irrelevant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3733;I decide to skip as many shrines as I can get away with and take a look at a map, noticing that there are various possible shortcuts that I can make good use of. A few hours later, when my path briefly intersects with the actual pilgrim route, I come face to face with a priestess who sees fit to berate me for not taking the proper route.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3733;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3734;I decide to skip as many shrines as I can get away with and take a look at a map, noticing that there are various possible shortcuts that I can make good use of. The journey is largely uneventful, and I feel that it was the right decision to take the shorter route as nobody seems to mind that I did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3734;I knew I could stop early!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3735;I decide against ending the pilgrimage early and continue along the main route, spending some time at every shrine I come across. As I do, I consider various times in the past when I have been less diligent and how I often have ended up regretting this, and I resolve to improve in that regard in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3735;Hard work pays off!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3736;I decide against ending the pilgrimage early and continue along the main route, spending some time at every shrine I come across. I reflect on the fact that I in the past would have chosen the easier route as that would have required less effort on my part, and I decide that those days are behind me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3736;I can't afford to rest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3737;I decide against ending the pilgrimage early and continue along the main route, spending some time at every shrine I come across. Once, I would have found doing such a thing quite wasteful as I was unsure whether the kami were real or not, but over the course of my journey I have reconsidered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3737;I no longer lack faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3738;I decide against ending the pilgrimage early and continue along the main route, spending some time at every shrine I come across. I have always had faith in the kami and the teachings of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, and as I visit the shrines and listen to the priests and priestesses there my faith only becomes stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3738;My faith has never been stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3739;I decide against ending the pilgrimage early and continue along the main route, spending some time at every shrine I come across. Once, I would have found such a journey rather difficult, but the long journey to the start of the Kumano route and the journey along the route has made me stronger than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3739;I am not so weak now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3740;I decide against ending the pilgrimage early and continue along the main route, spending some time at every shrine I come across. Though I have never been what anyone really would consider weak, I am noticing that I feel less and less tired at the end of every day. Evidently, the journey has paid off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3740;I feel stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3741;I decide against ending the pilgrimage early and continue along the main route, spending some time at every shrine I come across. At one of these shrines I come across a priestess that fancies herself a scholar on both religious and mundane matters, and she is more than willing to share a few insights with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3741;This will be useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3742;I decide against ending the pilgrimage early and continue along the main route, spending some time at every shrine I come across. The priests and priestesses found there are quite pleased to learn that I have not skipped any of the shrines, and they tell me that it is most definitely something that sets me apart from many pilgrims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3742;I did the right thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3743;I decide against ending the pilgrimage early and continue along the main route, spending some time at every shrine I come across. Along the road I come across an old warrior who offers to teach me some of what he knows so that I know how to defend yourself if I should happen to be beset by bandits or the like, and I see no reason to refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3743;He was most helpful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3744;I decide against ending the pilgrimage early and continue along the main route, spending some time at every shrine I come across. The journey is largely uneventful, and though it is not over quickly I do not really regret spending more time on my pilgrimage as the route I followed was quite scenic at times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3744;It has been enjoyable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3745;As I reach the end of the Kumano route I know that it is time for me to head home. Even though there are things I could do away from home that might be of interest, there is doubtlessly a lot of work waiting for me back at [Root.Capital.GetName], and it would be good to deal with it sooner rather than later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3745;I must head home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3746;Ise Grand Shrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3746;At last I have arrived at Ise, the site of the ancient and massive shrine complex known as Ise Grand Shrine, which primarily is dedicated to Amaterasu-Omikami, the great august kami who shines in the heaven. It is one of the holiest and most important sites of the Shinto religion, and I am far from the only pilgrim present.\nThough parts of the shrine complex are not open to most pilgrims I am confident that I am considered important enough to be permitted to visit nearly any location I might wish, which might be something I want to take advantage of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3746;Praise the Sun Goddess!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3747;As I am walking around near the main shrine at Ise a young priestess approaches me to inform me that the Saio, the head priestess of Ise and a member of the Imperial Family, has heard of my arrival and wishes to speak with me if I can find the time. I am free to refuse, of course, but it would probably upset the Saio, and possibly her relatives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3747;I will meet with her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3747;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3748;The Saio, [the_saio.GetBestName], looks pleased when I am led into her presence, and she welcomes me to Ise in both her own name and the name of Amaterasu. She indicates that she has set aside some time for me, and it is clear from the way she phrases it that it is up to me what I want to attempt to accomplish during this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3748;I want to seduce her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3748;I want to befriend her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3748;I want Amaterasu's blessing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3749;During my meeting with [From.GetBestName], a pilgrim that has come to the Ise Grand Shrine, I graciously tell [From.GetHerHim] that [From.GetSheHe] can suggest a topic of conversation. To my surprise, [From.GetBestName] suggests that [From.GetSheHe] and I should stop talking and head somewhere more private to engage in more intomate activities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3749;Oh, that sounds lovely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3749;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3749;Me and you? NEVER!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3750;The Saio, [From.GetBestName], is quite receptive to my attempt to seduce her, and since she is in charge of Ise it is not a problem for her to ensure that the two of us are left alone so that we can get to know one another much more intimately. It would be bad if word got out, but hopefully it will not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3750;THat went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3751;A messenger arrived from Ise today, bringing a letter from one of the lesser priestesses there. According to this letter, the Saio, [From.GetBestName], the head priestess of Ise, is not as celibate as she is supposed to be. Though the letter does not provide any proof, it is doubtful that the priestess is lying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3751;The Saio has shamed us all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3752;Some days after [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s visit I start hearing rumors suggesting that I have broken your vow of celibacy. It is unknown who started the rumors, and they do not seem to contain any mention of the identity of my new lover, but it is probably only a matter of time before [From.GetBestName] learns of it..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3752;I should have been more discreet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3753;The Saio is displeased by my attempt at seduction and tells me in no uncertain terms that she will not betray her vow of celibacy. She suggests that I should leave her presence at once, and that I should reconsider my behavior as Amaterasu does not look kindly on pilgrims that behave improperly during a pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3753;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3754;The Saio is displeased by my attempt at seduction and tells me in no uncertain terms that she will not betray her vow of celibacy. She further informs me that she would not consider sleeping with me even if she had not made any such vow. She orders me to leave her presence at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3754;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3755;I tell the Saio, [the_saio.GetBestName], that I wish to get to know her better, and she is willing to converse with me on a number of different subjects in order to make that possible. It turns out that the two of us have a lot in common, and that we enjoy each other's company. By the time I depart we have become close friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3755;Best friends forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3756;During my meeting with [From.GetBestName], a pilgrim that has come to the Ise Grand Shrine, I graciously tell [From.GetHerHim] that [From.GetSheHe] can suggest a topic of conversation once the initial pleasantries are over. [From.GetSheHeCap] says that [From.GetSheHe] would like to get to know me better, and we turn out to have a lot in common..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3756;I made a new friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3757;I tell the Saio, [the_saio.GetBestName], that I wish to get to know her better, and she is willing to converse with me on a number of different subjects in order to make that possible. Unfortunate, it turns out that the two of us have nothing in common, and that neither of us enjoy the conversation. She quickly orders me to leave her presence..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3757;That didn't go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3758;During my meeting with [From.GetBestName], a pilgrim that has come to the Ise Grand Shrine, I graciously tell [From.GetHerHim] that [From.GetSheHe] can suggest a topic of conversation once the initial pleasantries are over. [From.GetSheHeCap] says that [From.GetSheHe] would like to get to know me better. Sadly, nothing I learn about [From.GetHerHim] is to my liking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3758;I don't like [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3759;During my meeting with [From.GetBestName], a pilgrim that has come to the Ise Grand Shrine, I graciously tell [From.GetHerHim] that [From.GetSheHe] can suggest a topic of conversation once the initial pleasantries are over. [From.GetSheHeCap] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] wishes for me to bless [From.GetHerHim] in the name of Amaterasu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3759;A blessing? Sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3759;A blessing? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3760;I ask the Saio, [the_saio.GetBestName], to bless me in the name of Amaterasu, and after considering my request for a brief moment she tells me that it is not unreasonable and that I shall have my blessing. The two of us converse a while longer, but eventually she needs to attend to other matters and has to ask me to depart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3760;I got what I wanted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3761;I ask the Saio, [the_saio.GetBestName], to bless me in the name of Amaterasu, and after considering my request for a brief moment she tells me that it is unreasonable and that I shall not have my blessing. I feel that perhaps I could change her mind, given enough time, but she asks me to leave her presence at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3761;That didn't work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3763;I have encountered many other pilgrims at Ise Grand Shrine and also many priests and priestesses serving both Amaterasu-Omikami herself and various other kami, and this has made me reflect on the Shinto faith. Once, I might have had my doubts, but those days are behind me as I feel that the pilgrimage only has made my faith stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3763;Amaterasu watches over us all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3764;I have encountered many other pilgrims at Ise Grand Shrine and also many priests and priestesses serving both Amaterasu-Omikami herself and various other kami, and this has made me reflect on the Shinto faith. Once, I might have had faith in the kami, but those days are behind me as I feel that the pilgrimage only has made ny faith weaker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3764;Amaterasu is nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3765;As I am walking around outside the main shrine at Ise I feel a sudden flash of inspiration, and many glorious truths are at once clear to me. I need to share these truths with those around me, and I feel that writing down the message on the walls of the shrine is the best way to accomplish this, even though many of the onlookers try to dissuade me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3765;AMATERASU SPEAKS TO ME!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3766;A young priestess comes running into me presence to inform me that [From.GetBestName], a pilgrim visiting Ise, has started writing down various unholy messages on the walls of the shrine, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] is revealing truths that come directly from Amaterasu herself. The priestess asks me what I want to do about the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3766;Imprison this mad[From.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3766;Get [From.GetHerHim] out of here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3766;Just have someone clean it up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3766;AMATERASU SPEAKS TO [From.GetHerHimFullCaps]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3767;I am in the middle of writing down the glorious truths Amaterasu have revealed to me and fail to pay attention to my surroundings, which means I do not notice the guards before they are upon me. They seize me and drag me away, ignoring my demands to be released, and before long they drag me into a cell and lock me inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3767;Amaterasu didn't mention this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3768;I am in the middle of writing down the glorious truths Amaterasu have revealed to me and fail to pay attention to my surroundings, which means I do not notice the guards before they are upon me. They seize me and drag me away, ignoring my demands to be released, and before long they have dragged me to the outskirts of Ise and told me to go away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3768;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3769;I finish writing the most holy message from Amaterasu on the walls of the shrine and move away from it, satisfied with my work. As I leave, I notice that a number of priests and priestesses come running and start cleaning away the words that I wrote. I see no reason to rewrite them at this time, as I can share the message elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3769;THE TRUTH WILL NOT BE CONCEALED!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3770;The crowd surrounding me goes silent as a young priestess comes running, and though I initially think that she is there to try to stop me from sharing the glorious truths that Amaterasu revealed to me it turns out that she has brought a message from the Saio that tells the crowd to heed my words as they clearly come from Amaterasu herself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3770;AMATERASU SPEAKS TO ME!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3771;My visit to Ise has been rather pleasant, and I am not sure that I have seen everything of note there, but it is time for me to take my leave. Doubtlessly, there are many things back at [Root.Capital.GetName] that require my attention already, and delaying my return would therefore be rather unwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3771;Time to go home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3772;The Holy Mountain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3772;For some time now, the iconic shape of Mount Fuji, my destination and one of the Three Holy Mountains, has been visible at the horizon, steadily growing larger, and now I have finally arrived at its base.\nI can see plenty of other pilgrims around, as well as priests and priestesses maintaining the many [Root.Religion.GetName] shrines surrounding the mountain. They all appear to be absorbed in their own thoughts at the moment, and pay little attention to me.\nWhile I knew some of what to expect from the many depictions of the mountain that I have seen in the past, it is definitely a sight worth seeing in person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3772;It is quite impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3773;There are several pilgrim routes circling Mount Fuji, and also a number that appear to permit me to ascend all the way to the summit. Though the journey to the summit might be difficult, and perhaps even somewhat dangerous, people would likely think more highly of me if I ascended the mountain, but it is ultimately up to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3773;I must climb the mountain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3773;I don't need to climb it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3774;I head up along one of the pilgrim routes leading to the summit of Mount Fuji, finding the going rather difficult as the path is both narrow and steep in several places. Partway up the side of the mountain I accidentally cause a small rockslide, and though I manage to avoid the worst of it some of the smaller rocks still hit me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3774;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3775;I head up along one of the pilgrim routes leading to the summit of Mount Fuji, finding the going rather difficult as the path is both narrow and steep in several places. However, I press on, and eventually find the going easier and easier despite the route not becoming more forgiving. It seems my pilgrimage has paid off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3775;I am not so weak now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3776;I head up along one of the pilgrim routes leading to the summit of Mount Fuji, finding the going rather difficult as the path is both narrow and steep in several places. Pressing on, I find strength within me that I did not think I had, and the going becomes more and more manageable even though the route hardly becomes more forgiving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3776;I feel stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3777;I head up along one of the pilgrim routes leading to the summit of Mount Fuji, finding the going rather difficult as the path is both narrow and steep in several places. Once, the prospect of such a climb would have been too daunting to contemplate, but I am a changed [Root.GetManWoman] as a result of my pilgrimage, and I press on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3777;I can't afford to relax!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3778;I head up along one of the pilgrim routes leading to the summit of Mount Fuji, finding the going rather difficult as the path is both narrow and steep in several places. I am no stranger to having to work hard to achieve what I want to achieve, however, and I refuse to consider giving up on the climb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3778;I must press on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3779;I head up along one of the pilgrim routes leading to the summit of Mount Fuji, finding the going rather difficult as the path is both narrow and steep in several places. Even so, the journey is not entirely unpleasant, and it is also rather uneventful, and though it takes a while I make good progress towards the summit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3779;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3781;It takes me some time, but eventually I manage to ascend all the way to the summit of Mount Fuji. The view from the mountain is quite nice, and I feel that I never would have gotten to see it if I had not put my faith in the [Root.Religion.GetName] religion and the kami, seeing as I never would have made a pilgrimage if that was not the case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3781;My faith is strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3782;It takes me some time, but eventually I manage to ascend all the way to the summit of Mount Fuji. The journey has been exhausting, and I do not find the view to be as pleasant as I had been led to believe, and given how disappointing it has been I start to wonder whether the whole pilgrimage has been a waste of my time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3782;I had expected far better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3783;It takes me some time, but eventually I manage to ascend all the way to the summit of Mount Fuji. Looking down on the land below, I do not feel that the experience has brought me closer to the kami or has given me any more insights into the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, but I cannot deny that the climb still was worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3783;The view is quite good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3785;I decide to head along one of the less travelled pilgrimage routes circling Mount Fuji and make sure to stop at the shrines I come across to pay my respect to the kami there. The priests and priestesses tending to the shrines are quite welcoming, and they make me feel rather more confident about the teachings of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith with their words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3785;My faith is strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3786;I decide to head along one of the less travelled pilgrimage routes circling Mount Fuji and make sure to stop at the shrines I come across to pay my respect to the kami there. Several of the priests and priestesses there express their disappointment in the fact that I decided not to climb the mountain, and I had expected far better from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3786;This was a waste of time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3787;I decide to head along one of the less travelled pilgrimage routes circling Mount Fuji and make sure to stop at the shrines I come across to pay my respect to the kami there. I speak a little with some of the other pilgrims I come across, and hear a few interestingt things, but on the whole it is an uneventful experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3787;I guess it was a nice walk...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3789;After another pilgrim mentions that there is a short pilgrimage route leading through a forest to the northwest of Mount Fuji I decide that I will take a short walk along this route before returning home. As I wander through this forest I feel something brush right past me, and I suddenly remember that the pilgrim warned me that the path might be haunted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3789;Was that a ghost?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3790;I sometimes get flashes of insight that others do not get, and as I am preparing to leave Mount Fuji I get the feeling that I must walk to the northwest. I do, entering the forest located there while wondering what I might find inside. Suddently, yet another insight comes to me, and I realize that the spirits of the dead are everywhere around me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3790;Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3791;I decide to take a walk along a pilgrimage route leading to the northwest from Mount Fuji because the forest I can see in that direction looks quite strange. Entering the forest, I feel something strange in the air all around me, and before long I can see the spirits of the dead appear in every direction, watching my every move with interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3791;Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3792;Having seen some pilgrims head off along a pilgrimage route leading into a forest on the northwestern side of Mount Fuji I decide to head in that direction as well. Some distance into the forest I come across a man sitting with his knees folded and a sword in his hand, and it appears as if he is about to use it on himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3792;I'll try to stop him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3792;I'll egg him on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3793;I call out to the man, telling him that he likely has much to live for and that whatever honor he might feel that he has lost is something he could regain in life. He hesitates for a few moments but then puts away the sword and rises to his feet, giving me a bow and telling me that he really needed to hear that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3793;Happy to help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3794;I call out to the man, telling him that he likely has much to live for and that whatever honor he might feel that he has lost is something he could regain in life. The man calls me a fool for not believing in the righteousness of seppuku, and I have no time to react before the man takes his own life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3794;Oh, no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3795;Though the journey to Mount Fuji has had a few pleasant moments I still do not feel like things are going my way, and as I am walking along a pilgrimage route leading to the northwest from the sacred mountain I consider whether it actually is worth returning from my pilgrimage, seeing as my life is unlikely to get better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3795;This is the end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3795;I will keep on living...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3796;I resolve to keep on living, and as I keep walking through the forest I reflect on my life and the people around me. There have been bad times, for sure, but now that I think about it there have also been good times, and though things might be difficult at times I resolve to press on and try to look on the bright side of things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3796;I have things to live for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3797;I resolve to keep on living, and as I keep walking through the forest I reflect on my life and the people around me. Though I try to look for good things that have happened to me, they are rather few, and the same goes for having enjoyable company. Still, I have made my choice, and perhaps I will not come to regret it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3797;Let's hope things improve...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3798;Though I could have elected to head home once I finished with the pilgrimage routes at the sacred mountain itself I decide to spend some more time nearby and take off along a route leading off to the northwest, passing through a thick forest. The journey is uneventful, but I do not feel that I made the wrong choice even so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3798;It was a pleasant walk!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3799;It is time to leave Mount Fuji behind and return home, as I cannot avoid my responsibilities back at [Root.Capital.GetName] forever, and even though I left instructions for how to manage my realm in my absence there likely are things that will require my personal attention even if everything has been done exactly as I ordered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3799;Time to go home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3800;The Shrines of Shikoku;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3800;I have finally arrived in Shikoku, where the many shrines I plan to visit during my pilgrimage can be found.\nUnlike most other pilgrimages, which tend to involve visiting one or a few holy sites located closely together, the Shikoku pilgrimage involves walking around the whole island, following a symbolic path to enlightenment.\nI intend to spend the rest of the day taking care of the final preparations before the journey, followed by a meal and a good night's sleep, as I know I have far to walk over the coming weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3800;The long walk begins tomorrow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3802;The first part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of awakening. I consider the matter as I visit the shrines one after the other, but so far I am not sure what I really am supposed to be feeling, and I suppose that I will have to wait and see. At least the weather has been nice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3802;I suppose I should keep going...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3803;The first part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of awakening. I consider the matter as I visit the shrines one after the other, and though I am not entirely convinced that I have grasped the essence of what I am supposed to understand I am still willing to make an effort to become more enlightened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3803;I am willing to learn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3804;The first part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of awakening. I consider the matter as I visit the shrines one after the other, and listening to the priests tending to these shrines gives me a better idea of what the Buddhist faith is all about, and this knowledge fills me with confidence that it is the one and only true faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3804;In faith I find strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3805;The first part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of awakening. I consider the matter as I visit the shrines one after the other, but I really have a hard time seeing how it is relevant, and the priests tending to the shrines are most unhelpful when I seek their guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3805;This is pointless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3806;As I keep moving from shrine to shrine I occasionally come across other pilgrims, and I have overheard a few of them considering the idea of taking a shortcut from the eastern side of Shikoku to the western side and thus skipping to the end of the pilgrimage. It is certainly not what a pilgrim is supposed to do, but it might be tempting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3806;I will also skip to the end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3806;I must follow the true path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3807;I conclude that following the actual path pilgrims are supposed to take will take up far too much of my time, and decide that it is reasonable to take a shortcut to the end of the route. Partway across the island I meet a wandering priest who berates me for not following the true path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3807;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3808;I conclude that following the actual path pilgrims are supposed to take will take up far too much of my time, and decide that it is reasonable to take a shortcut to the end of the route. Normally, the prospect of working hard to reach a goal would not have bothered me, but I have started to realize that I spend too much time working.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3808;Work is boring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3809;I conclude that following the actual path pilgrims are supposed to take will take up far too much of my time, and decide that it is reasonable to take a shortcut to the end of the route. As I move along this shorter route I start to consider the fact that it often would be possible to take other shortcuts in life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3809;I should take it more easy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3810;I conclude that following the actual path pilgrims are supposed to take will take up far too much of my time, and decide that it is reasonable to take a shortcut to the end of the route. Despite taking it easy, I feel that the going is hard, perhaps because I have been taking it easy rather than worrying about staying in shape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3810;Strength isn't everything...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3811;I conclude that following the actual path pilgrims are supposed to take will take up far too much of my time, and decide that it is reasonable to take a shortcut to the end of the route. I have never been particularly strong, and even though I am taking it easy during my journey I find that it is difficult at times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3811;This is not ideal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3812;I conclude that following the actual path pilgrims are supposed to take will take up far too much of my time, and decide that it is reasonable to take a shortcut to the end of the route. Once, the idea of not doing what the teachings of the Buddhist religion said would have been unthinkable, but that was then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3812;I was boring before...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3813;I conclude that following the actual path pilgrims are supposed to take will take up far too much of my time, and decide that it is reasonable to take a shortcut to the end of the route. My faith has never been particularly strong, and I find myself questioning it more and more as I keep walking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3813;The Buddha was wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3814;I conclude that following the actual path pilgrims are supposed to take will take up far too much of my time, and decide that it is reasonable to take a shortcut to the end of the route. Though the route might be less scenic than the true pilgrimage I feel that the time I save is well worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3814;I made the right choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3816;I keep walking along the true pilgrimage route and reach the second set of shrines.

EVTOPTA_SOH_3833;I will prove my faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3834;I keep walking along the true pilgrimage route and reach the second set of shrines. This part of the route is dedicated to the concept of discipline, but though I try to determine how I could better myself I become more and more convinced that it is rather pointless and that the whole idea is quite silly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3834;The Buddha was wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3835;I keep walking along the true pilgrimage route and reach the second set of shrines. This part of the route is dedicated to the concept of discipline, but though I try to determine how I could better myself I find it hard to determine how I could do this. Still, I suppose that I have made more of an effort than many others have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3835;I could have done worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3836;I keep walking along the true pilgrimage route and reach the second set of shrines. This part of the route is dedicated to the concept of discipline, and as I already live a rather disciplined life there is little I could do to improve in that regard, even if I of course should avoid being too proud of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3836;I know the value of discipline!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3838;The third part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of enlightenment, which is something that I contemplate as I move from shrine to shrine. As a result of my conversations with the priests at those shrines I start to realize that I know more than I once thought I did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3838;I am smarter now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3839;The third part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of enlightenment, which is something that I contemplate as I move from shrine to shrine. As a result of my conversations with the priests at those shrines I start to realize that I know more than I once thought I did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3839;I am smarter now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3840;The third part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of enlightenment, which is something that I contemplate as I move from shrine to shrine. The priests at the shrines are quite willing to converse with me about various matters of faith to help me on my path, and I learn quite a few new things from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3840;I learned a few things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3841;The third part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of enlightenment, which is something that I contemplate as I move from shrine to shrine. As best I can tell, I do not become more enlightened as I continue along the path, but perhaps enlightenment is something that takes a while to notice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3841;Well, that didn't do anything...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3842;The third part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of enlightenment, which is something that I contemplate as I move from shrine to shrine. As I keep walking I realize just how important it is to seek knowledge, as well as just how much knowledge there is to be found in various holy texts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3842;My faith is strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3843;The third part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of enlightenment, which is something that I contemplate as I move from shrine to shrine. However, while I get enlightened in a way, the main thing that I realize is that the Buddhist religion really is not all it claims to be, and that faith is not a path to true knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3843;Faith is futile!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3844;The third part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of enlightenment, which is something that I contemplate as I move from shrine to shrine. Some of the other pilgrims are really struggling with this, and I do what I can to help them on their path to enlightenment, which they thank me for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3844;Happy to help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3846;The final part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of nirvana, the release from the cycle of death and rebirth. I consider this matter as I continue from shrine to shrine, taking to the priests tending to them. The more I hear about the concept, the less appealing it sounds to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3846;This has been a waste of time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3847;The final part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of nirvana, the release from the cycle of death and rebirth. I consider this matter as I continue from shrine to shrine, taking to the priests tending to them. Though I are uncertain whether I will be worthy of nirvana in this life, I resolve to strive for it every day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3847;My faith has never been stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3848;The final part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of nirvana, the release from the cycle of death and rebirth. Perhaps I am already worthy, seeing as I am true to the teachings of the Buddhist faith and get enlightened insights all the time? Maybe the only thing holding me back is the fact that I am still alive?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3848;Nirvana awaits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3848;Nirvana can wait...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3849;The final part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of nirvana, the release from the cycle of death and rebirth. I consider this matter as I continue from shrine to shrine, taking to the priests tending to them. I am not quite sure I understand the concept of nirvana any better now than I did before my pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3849;At least the journey has been pleasant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3850;The final part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of nirvana, the release from the cycle of death and rebirth. I consider this matter as I continue from shrine to shrine, taking to the priests tending to them. The priests tell me some things that help me understand the concept better, but I am unsure if I truly understand it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3850;I am willing to learn more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3851;I have finally reached the end of the Shikoku pilgrimage route, and it is time for me to head back to [Root.Capital.GetBestName] to attend to various matters that might require my attention at home. Hopefully, the return journey will be both uneventful and quick, as I do not wish for delays or unwelcome surprises.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3851;Time to go home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3852;A Visit to Mount Koya;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3852;After a long journey I have arrived at Mount Koya. The sacred monastery is located between the mountain's eight peaks, making it appear almost as if it is situated in a lotus plant, and the sight is impressive even at a distance.\nThough the whole area is sacred and many of the people here might be interesting to talk to, the sheer size of the place is such that it is unlikely that I will be able to find the time to look everywhere for something specific.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3852;I'm sure I'll find something interesting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3854;The monks at Mount Koya are pleased to learn that I have an education focused on religion. When they learn that my education is a bit less extensive than they would have assumed, they immediately offer to help me learn more, and despite not being able to spend much time with them I feel that I understand several things much better now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3854;I have learned much!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3855;After talking to some of the monks at Mount Koya I learn a few new things. Most of them have to do with the Buddhist faith, which is unsurprising, but I can also seee ways to perhaps apply that knowledge to other things, and returning from my pilgrimage with more knowledge is certainly good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3855;This should be useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3856;There are many learned men at Mount Koya, and though most of them are monks and thus have dedicated themselves to the Buddhist faith more thoroughly than I plan to do, there are also some others present that are quite learned. Having spoken to some of these people I start to wonder if I perhaps should dedicate myself to seeking knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3856;I will be a Scholar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3856;Theology feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3856;I shall be a Mystic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3856;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3857;The various holy places at Mount Koya truly are a sight to behold, and the people there are quite friendly and clearly work to better themselves and to helping their fellow Buddhists. I am quite satisfied with what I have seen, and resolve to dedicate myself more fully to my faith from now on, as it is the one and only true way to enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3857;Praise the Buddha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3858;Though the various shrines at Mount Koya looked impressive at first, they get less impressive as I visit them, and both the monks and the other pilgrims are most unhelpful. They might be telling the truth when they claim to follow the teachings of the Buddha, but if that is the case then I doubt that there is any enlightenement to be found down that path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3858;The Buddha was wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3859;Though Mount Koya primarily is a Buddhist holy site there are also some shrines in the area that are dedicated to the kami, and thus I have come across a few Shinto pilgrims and priestesses as well. Though they do not make an effort to convince me that the Shinto faith is superior to the Buddhist faith I still consider conversion for a moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3859;Praise the kami!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3859;I will not betray my faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3860;As I speak to the monks at Mount Koya I start to consider the idea of celibacy. It is certainly not a requirement for anyone to live a celibate life if they are not a monk or a nun, but it might help me further along the path to enlightenment even so, and perhaps it is something that might be of interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3860;Celibacy feels right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3860;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3861;I speak to several of the pilgrims at Mount Koya, inquiring about who they are and why they are there. Many of them are rather uninteresting people, all things considered, but one of them turns out to be a young warrior of some renown, and he offers to teach me a few things, free of charge. I see no reason to refuse, and the lesson goes quite well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3861;He was a good teacher!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3862;I spend a little time visiting the shrines at Mount Koya and speaking to the people found there. Eventually I start to desire some time on my own to reflect on what I have learned, and I resolve to take a walk along the nearby pilgrim route instead. It is certainly pleasant enough, even if I might not have learned much from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3862;I guess it could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3863;Though there might be more to see at Moutn Koya I have spent some time there now and it would be prudent to head home. The journey is quite long, after all, and once I get back to [Root.Capital.GetName] it is quite likely that I will find out that there is work to do, which is unlikely to decrease with time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3863;Time to go home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3865;After a long but uneventful journey home I finally arrive in [Root.Capital.GetName]. The pilgrimage I went on was quite pleasant, all things considered, and though it took some time I do not regret it. Perhaps I will even decide to set out on another pilgrimage in the future, as there are more places to visit and more to discover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3865;A jorney to remember!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3866;After a long but uneventful journey home I finally arrive in [Root.Capital.GetName]. Though there were a few pleasant moments during the pilgrimage I feel that it overall was a letdown, and my faith in the teachings of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith is nowhere near as strong as it once was. I doubt I will ever consider another pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3866;That was a waste of time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3867;After a long but uneventful journey home I finally arrive in [Root.Capital.GetName]. The kami have been silent since the unpleasant welcome my revelation received, and though my faith in them remains unshaken I am certain I have failed them in a way. Perhaps I will give it another attempt in the future, but perhaps not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3867;A journey to forget!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
