# Joining and re-founding
EVTDESC_SOH_803;[Root.GetBestName],\nI welcome you into the ranks of the Hwarang.

EVTDESC_SOH_809;[From.GetBestName] has decreed that the Hwarang, an organization of young warriors serving the kings of Silla before Silla's surrender to Goryeo, is to be refounded under [From.GetHerHis] righteous leadership. Though the decree only was made recently, word is already spreading swiftly, and many have expressed an interest in joining the ranks of the reformed Hwarang.\n\nWhile there might be those that doubt that this new organization will prove to be a worthy successor of the Hwarang of old, it is likely that few openly will question [From.GetBestName]'s decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_809;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_809;An auspicious event!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Spiritual Guidance
EVTDESC_SOH_1001;I have been approached by [FromFrom.GetBestName], a member of the Hwarang. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] is asking me to help [FromFrom.GetHerHim] adhere more closely to the values the Hwarang hold dear by providing spiritual guidance. Should I accept, the decision as to what to teach [FromFrom.GetHerHim] would be up to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1001;Of course I'll help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1001;I'll only do it if you donate to charity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_1001;I would require payment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_1001;I would want a Favor in return!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_1001;I'll only do this as a Favor to you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_1001;I have no interest in this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1002;After considering my request [From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] would be willing to give me spiritual guidance, asking for nothing in return aside from me being an attentive student.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1002;Sounds fair it me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1003;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] is willing to give me spiritual guidance if I am willing to a donation to charity. Of course, I could refuse and look for a teacher elsewhere if I would rather not accomodate this request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1003;That is a reasonable request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1003;Charity? That's not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1004;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] considers a charitable donation to a local shrine a small price to pay for spiritual guidance from me, and [From.GetSheHe] has provided proof that such a payment has been made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1004;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1005;I had expected my request for [From.GetBestName] to make a charitable donation to a local shrine in exchange for my guidance to be more than reasonable, but it seems [From.GetSheHe] is unwilling to make such a payment even if that means no lessons will be forthcoming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1005;Well, [From.GetSheHe] is free to refuse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1006;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] would require monetary compensation for any spiritual guidance [From.GetSheHe] provides. Of course, I can always refuse and try to find another teacher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1006;Of course I'd be willing to pay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1006;I don't see that happening...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1007;It seems [From.GetBestName] is very interested in getting spiritual guidance from me in particular, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] has decided that my request for monetary compensation indeed is reasonable and has provided the requested payment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1007;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1008;I would have expected [From.GetBestName] to be willing to pay for spiritual guidance from me, but it seems [From.GetSheHe] thinks that the request is unreasonable, as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] would rather look for a teacher elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1008;I suppose that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1009;It seems [From.GetBestName] thinks that [From.GetSheHe] would be doing me a great service by agreeing to provide spiritual guidance, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that I would have to grant [From.GetHerHim] a Favor in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1009;A Favor? Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1009;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1010;[From.GetBestName] seems to be very eager indeed to get spiritual guidance from me, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] indeed is willing to owe me a Favor in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1010;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1011;Whether due to mistrust or something else, [From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] does not think that it would be reasonable to owe me a Favor in return for spiritual guidance. [From.GetSheHe] will look for spiritual guidance elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1011;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1012;[From.GetBestName] has considered my request for spiritual guidance and has determined that it only would be reasonable if I am willing to consider it repayment of the Favor [From.GetSheHe] owes me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1012;I can agree to that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1012;I think I'd rather keep the Favor...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1013;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] indeed would be willing to consider spiritual guidance from me repayment of the Favor I owe [From.GetHerHim], much like I had hoped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1013;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1014;It seems [From.GetBestName] does not think that spiritual guidance from me would be sufficient repayment of the Favor I owe [From.GetHerHim], as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] will look for guidance elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1014;I suppose that's reasonable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1015;I would have thought that [From.GetBestName] would have been eager to give me spiritual guidance, or that [From.GetSheHe] at the very least would have been willing to work out a deal, but instead [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it would be a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1015;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1017;After spending some time getting to know [From.GetBestName] better to figure out just what kind of spiritual guidance I reasonably could give [FromFrom.GetHerHim] it is time to make a decision. Maybe there is a particular way I want to change [FromFrom.GetHerHim], regardless of whether it is what the Hwarang would think best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] more chaste!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] more temperate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] more charitable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] more diligent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] more patient!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] kinder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] humbler!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTH_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] braver!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTI_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] more contet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTJ_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] more gregarious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTK_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] more honest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTL_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] more just!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTM_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] more trusting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTN_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] more zealous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTO_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] less chaste!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTP_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] less temperate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTQ_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] greedier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTR_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] more slothful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTS_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] more wroth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTT_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] more envious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTU_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] prouder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTV_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] more arbitrary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTW_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] more craven!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTX_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] less kind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTY_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] more cynical!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTZ_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] less honest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAA_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] paranoid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAB_SOH_1017;I should try to make [From.GetHerHim] more shy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAC_SOH_1017;Actually, I can't think of a good lesson...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1018;After spending some time getting to know me better [From.GetBestName] has finally decided what kind of spiritual guidance [From.GetSheHe] can give me, and [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that the lessons will be on the topic of chastity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1018;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1020;My teacher [From.GetBestName] is giving me spiritual guidance on the topic of chastity, and [From.GetHerHis] words have made me consider whether I actually can make any progress while I have a lover. Maybe I should break up with [breakup_target.GetBestName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1020;I have to end things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1020;Surely that is not necessary...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1021;Today I received word that [From.GetBestName] no longer wishes to be my lover. I knew [From.GetSheHe] was getting spiritual guidance concerned with chastity, but I had not really considered what this could mean for me before today, and now it is too late to change things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1021;[FromFrom.GetBestName] must be behind this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1022;My student, [From.GetBestName], approached me today to inform me that [From.GetSheHe] has taken certain steps to live a chaster life. [From.GetSheHeCap] was unwilling to provide any details, but as best I can tell [From.GetSheHe] was sincere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1022;I think we are making some progress here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1023;Though I have been giving [From.GetBestName] lessons on the subject of chastity for a while now and I think [From.GetSheHe] has made some progress, [From.GetSheHe] approached me today to inform me that [From.GetSheHe] is having some doubts and that certain things I have said really do not appeal to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1023;The lessons obviously need to continue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1024;As [From.GetBestName] continues to give me spiritual guidance related to chastity I find myself wondering if I actually am going to find the lessons appealing at any point. I am not particularly chaste, and maybe I should not try to change myself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1024;It would be a change for the better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1024;Actually, I don't want to change!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1025;I have been having some difficulty teaching [From.GetBestName] how to be more chaste, but at long last I can see some signs of progress. It will probably still be a while before [From.GetSheHe] has reached the point where it is prudent to end the lessons, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1025;I knew [From.GetSheHe] could do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1026;Though I have been doing my best to teach [From.GetBestName] how to be more chaste, [From.GetSheHe] is not really making any progress. As best I can tell, [From.GetSheHe] is trying [From.GetHerHis] best, but considering [From.GetSheHe] definitely is not known for [From.GetHerHis] chastity that might not be enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1026;At least [From.GetSheHe] is trying...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1027;Today [From.GetBestName] approached me to inform me that [From.GetSheHe] no longer is interested in receiving spiritual guidance from me, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] is content to remain the way [From.GetSheHe] is regardless of whether the Hwarang would approve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1027;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1028;Though [From.GetBestName] has provided several arguments as to why chastity would be a good thing, I find myself wondering whether living a chaster life actually would be detrimental as it would make it less likely for my bloodline to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1028;Maybe chastity would be a mistake?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1029;[From.GetBestName] has been getting spiritual guidance from me for a while now, and I have done my best to convince [From.GetHerHim] that chastity would be to [From.GetHerHis] advantage. However, it seems [From.GetBestName] thinks that it might endanger [From.GetHerHis] bloodline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1029;You're overthinking this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1030;I approached [From.GetBestName] with my doubts about chastity due to it potentially endangering my bloodline. It seems this is not an uncommon fear, as [From.GetSheHe] had arguments ready to convince me, and I have been told that [From.Religion.GetHighGodName] will ensure my legacy bloodline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1030;That's fair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1031;I approached [From.GetBestName] with my doubts about chastity due to it potentially endangering my bloodline. Though [From.GetSheHe] had arguments ready, those arguments were unconvincing, and I still wonder whether this is all a big mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1031;Maybe I'll see the point in the future?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1031;I think it is best to end these lessons...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1032;Though I did my best to convince [From.GetBestName] about the value of chastity it seems I did not succeed. [From.GetSheHeCap] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] no longer thinks that spiritual guidance from me is to [From.GetHerHis] advantage, and that it is time for our lessons to end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1032;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1033;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me spiritual guidance, but no matter how many lessons we have it really does not seem to be having any effect. I do my best to pay attention and to reflect on what I am being taught, but there has to be a problem somewhere as we are not making any progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1033;I must be doing something wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1033;[From.GetTitledName] is the problem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1034;[From.GetBestName] confronted me today, telling me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that the spiritual guidance I am providing is insufficient as [From.GetSheHe] really does not feel we are making any progress. [From.GetSheHeCap] asks that I consider what I can do better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1034;I will try to improve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1034;I am not the problem here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_1034;I just can't do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1035;[From.GetBestName] listened to what I had to say regarding our lessons not seeming to have an effect and informed me that [From.GetSheHe] will see what [From.GetSheHe] can do to improve, stating that [From.GetSheHe] is sorry [From.GetSheHe] has not been a better teacher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1035;I guess that's good enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1035;This has gone on long enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1036;I approached [From.GetBestName] and brought up the matter of [From.GetHerHis] lessons really not having an effect and that I thought that [From.GetSheHe] should do better. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] disagrees that [From.GetSheHe] is the problem, and suggests that I should consider what I am doing wrong instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1036;I suppose I could be at fault...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1036;I've had enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1037;I had expected [From.GetBestName] to either make excuses or tell me [From.GetSheHe] would work harder to provide me with useful spiritual guidance, but instead [From.GetSheHe] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] agrees that this is going nowhere and that it is time for our lessons to end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1037;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1038;It seems my response to [From.GetBestName] was not what [From.GetSheHe] wanted, as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that it is best for our lessons to end even though they have not had the desired effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1038;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1039;I have been receiving spiritual guidance from [From.GetBestName] for a while now, but I am starting to have second thoughts about the matter. I can see some value in the lessons I am being given at times, but at other times I feel it would be a mistake to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1039;I want to keep at it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1039;It is time to end this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1040;It seems [From.GetBestName] has grown tired of the spiritual guidance I have been providing as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it best for the lessons to end as they simply do not appeal to [From.GetHerHim] any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1040;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1041;Though I do my best to be mindful of the lessons I have received from [From.GetBestName] at all times, it is sometimes hard to rememver just why chastity was such a good idea. I just came across a very attractive servant, [tempting_servant.GetBestName], who seems really into me, and maybe I should have some fun?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1041;I'll give [tempting_servant.GetHerHim] a good tumble!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1041;[tempting_servant.GetSheHeCap] does not interest me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1042;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] recently experienced a setback when it comes to [From.GetHerHis] ongoing attempt to become a chaster person. [From.GetSheHeCap] was unwilling to provide any specifics, and I am not sure I want them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1042;I don't need to know...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1043;The spiritual guidance I have been receiving from [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. I now see what [From.GetSheHe] has been trying to teach me all along, and looking back it is hard to believe I could ever have wanted to live a different way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1043;I'll be chaste from now on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1043;I'll be both chaste and celibate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1044;The spiritual guidance I have been proving [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. [From.GetSheHeCap] has without a doubt become a chaste person, and no further lessons are necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1044;[From.GetSheHeCap] was a good student!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1045;The spiritual guidance I have been proving [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. [From.GetSheHeCap] has without a doubt become a chaste person, and [From.GetSheHe] has even gone as far as to inform me that [From.GetSheHe] will become celibate. No further lessons are necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1045;[From.GetSheHeCap] was a good student!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1047;The spiritual guidance I am giving to [From.GetBestName] does not seem to be having much of an effect. Though I suppose that not everyone might change their ways quickly, I sometimes wonder whether it is pointless to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1047;I should keep at it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1047;This is pointless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1048;Today [From.GetBestName] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it would be best for [From.GetHerHim] to stop giving me spiritual guidance even though I have not changed my ways as much as initially planned. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] thinks we are just wasting our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1048;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1050;After spending some time getting to know me better [From.GetBestName] has finally decided what kind of spiritual guidance [From.GetSheHe] can give me, and [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that the lessons will be on the topic of temperance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1050;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1052;As [From.GetBestName] continues to give me spiritual guidance related to temperance I find myself wondering if I actually am going to find the lessons appealing at any point. I am not particularly temperate, and maybe I should not try to change myself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1052;It would be a change for the better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1052;Actually, I don't want to change!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_1073;As [From.GetBestName] continues to give me spiritual guidance related to temperance I find myself wondering if I actually am going to find the lessons appealing at any point. I am not particularly charitable, and maybe I should not try to change myself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1076;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1078;I have been giving [From.GetBestName] spiritual guidance related to charity for a while now, and it is important that [From.GetSheHe] learns to willingly part with money. Lately, I have been considering whether I should encourage [From.GetHerHim] to give money to charity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1078;It would be good for [From.GetHerHim]!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1078;It would be a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1079;[From.GetBestName] gave me another lesson on the subject of charity today, and among [From.GetHerHis] ideas as to how I could be more charitable was the suggestion that I could donate some of my money to a local shrine, which [From.GetBestName] really thinks the Hwarang would approve of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1079;I suppose that's reasonable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1079;That sounds like a waste of money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1080;My suggestion that [From.GetBestName] should donate money to charity was well received, and I have received word that [From.GetSheHe] has made a large donation. Though I think further lessons will be necessary, we are clearly making some progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1080;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1081;My suggestion that [From.GetBestName] should donate money to charity was not received well, as [From.GetBestName] seems to think that it would be a waste of [From.GetHerHis] money. It is apparent we will need to continue with the lessons for a while yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1081;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1084;I have been giving [From.GetBestName] spiritual guidance related to charity for a while now, and it is important that [From.GetSheHe] learns to willingly part with money.

EVTOPTA_SOH_1084;It would benefit us both!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1084;It would be a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1085;[From.GetBestName] gave me another lesson on the subject of charity today, and among [From.GetHerHis] ideas as to what I could do to get in the right mindset was the suggestion that I could give some of my money to [From.GetHerHim] so that [From.GetSheHe] could spend it in my stead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1085;I suppose that's reasonable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1085;That sounds like a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_1085;I will not let you take advantage of me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1086;My suggestion that [From.GetBestName] could give me some of [From.GetHerHis] money as an exercise in charity was well received, and I just received a substantial payment from [From.GetHerHim]. Some people might disagree with my methods, but we are clearly making some progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1086;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1087;My suggestion that [From.GetBestName] could give me some of [From.GetHerHis] money as an exercise in charity was not received well, as [From.GetBestName] seemed to think that it would be a waste of [From.GetHerHis] money. It is apparent that we will need to continue with the lessons for a while yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1087;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1088;[From.GetBestName] took the suggestion that [From.GetSheHe] should give me some of [From.GetHerHis] money as an exercise in charity very poorly. [From.GetSheHeCap] thinks I am trying to take advantage of [From.GetHerHim], and has told me that [From.GetSheHe] no longer wishes to receive spiritual guidance from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1088;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1090;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me spiritual guidance, but no matter how many lessons we have it really does not seem to be having any effect. I do my best to pay attention and to reflect on what I am being taught, but there has to be a problem somewhere as we are not making any progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1090;I must be doing something wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1090;[From.GetTitledName] is the problem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1091;[From.GetBestName] confronted me today, telling me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that the spiritual guidance I am providing is insufficient as [From.GetSheHe] really does not feel we are making any progress. [From.GetSheHeCap] asks that I consider what I can do better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1091;I will try to improve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1091;I am not the problem here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_1091;I just can't do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1092;[From.GetBestName] listened to what I had to say regarding our lessons not seeming to have an effect and informed me that [From.GetSheHe] will see what [From.GetSheHe] can do to improve, stating that [From.GetSheHe] is sorry [From.GetSheHe] has not been a better teacher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1092;I guess that's good enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1092;This has gone on long enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1093;I approached [From.GetBestName] and brought up the matter of [From.GetHerHis] lessons really not having an effect and that I thought that [From.GetSheHe] should do better. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] disagrees that [From.GetSheHe] is the problem, and suggests that I should consider what I am doing wrong instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1093;I suppose I could be at fault...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1093;I've had enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1094;I had expected [From.GetBestName] to either make excuses or tell me [From.GetSheHe] would work harder to provide me with useful spiritual guidance, but instead [From.GetSheHe] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] agrees that this is going nowhere and that it is time for our lessons to end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1094;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1095;It seems my response to [From.GetBestName] was not what [From.GetSheHe] wanted, as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that it is best for our lessons to end even though they have not had the desired effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1095;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1096;I have been receiving spiritual guidance from [From.GetBestName] for a while now, but I am starting to have second thoughts about the matter. I can see some value in the lessons I am being given at times, but at other times I feel it would be a mistake to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1096;I want to keep at it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1096;It is time to end this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1097;It seems [From.GetBestName] has grown tired of the spiritual guidance I have been providing as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it best for the lessons to end as they simply do not appeal to [From.GetHerHim] any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1097;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1098;The spiritual guidance I have been receiving from [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. I now see what [From.GetSheHe] has been trying to teach me all along, and looking back it is hard to believe I could ever have wanted to live a different way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1098;I'll be charitable from now on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1099;The spiritual guidance I have been proving [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. [From.GetSheHeCap] has without a doubt become a very charitable person, and no further lessons are necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1099;[From.GetSheHeCap] was a good student!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1101;The spiritual guidance I am giving to [From.GetBestName] does not seem to be having much of an effect. Though I suppose that not everyone might change their ways quickly, I sometimes wonder whether it is pointless to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1101;I should keep at it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1101;This is pointless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1102;Today [From.GetBestName] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it would be best for [From.GetHerHim] to stop giving me spiritual guidance even though I have not changed my ways as much as initially planned. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] thinks we are just wasting our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1102;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1104;After spending some time getting to know me better [From.GetBestName] has finally decided what kind of spiritual guidance [From.GetSheHe] can give me, and [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that the lessons will be on the topic of diligence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1104;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1106;As [From.GetBestName] continues to give me spiritual guidance related to diligence I find myself wondering if I actually am going to find the lessons appealing at any point. I am not particularly diligent, and maybe I should not try to change myself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1106;It would be a change for the better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1106;Actually, I don't want to change!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1107;I have been having some difficulty teaching [From.GetBestName] how to be more diligent, but at long last I can see some signs of progress. It will probably still be a while before [From.GetSheHe] has reached the point where it is prudent to end the lessons, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1107;I knew [From.GetSheHe] could do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1108;Though I have been doing my best to teach [From.GetBestName] how to be more diligent, [From.GetSheHe] is not really making any progress. As best I can tell, [From.GetSheHe] is trying [From.GetHerHis] best, but considering [From.GetSheHe] definitely is not known for [From.GetHerHis] diligence that might not be enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1108;At least [From.GetSheHe] is trying...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1109;Today [From.GetBestName] approached me to inform me that [From.GetSheHe] no longer is interested in receiving spiritual guidance from me, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] is content to remain the way [From.GetSheHe] is regardless of whether the Hwarang would approve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1109;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1110;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me lessons about diligence and things to do to work on becoming more diligent. I suppose I should have expected that it would be a lot of work, but I am not sure if it is too much work for me or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1110;It will be worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1110;It is too much work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1111;Though I would have thought that [From.GetBestName] would have known to expect that it would be hard work to be diligent it seems [From.GetSheHe] had expected an easy time, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] no longer is interested in spiritual guidance from me due to it being too much work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1111;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1112;The spiritual guidance I am receiving from [From.GetBestName] on the subject of diligence is helpful, but though I work hard I keep finding more and more things to do. It is getting exhausing, particularly as I find myself having trouble sleeping due to always thinking about what I need to do next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1112;I'm sure this is for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1113;[From.GetBestName] really seems to be putting in an effort to become more diligent, which you would have expected, but lately you have been noticing that [From.GetSheHe] is looking rather tired, and it is possible [From.GetSheHe] is working too hard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1113;I'm sure it's nothing to worry about!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1114;[From.GetBestName] has been giving me spiritual guidance for a while now, and I am working as hard as I can to become more diligent. However, despite all I am doing [From.GetBestName] keeps telling me I have far to go, and it is really starting to annoy me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1114;I grow impatient!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1115;It seems [From.GetBestName] was expecting the spiritual guidance [From.GetSheHe] receives from me to be something that would not take all that long, and though [From.GetSheHe] used to be known as a rather patient person that no longer seems to be the case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1115;This is most unexpected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1116;[From.GetBestName] is getting more and more impatient for the spiritual guidance I am giving [From.GetHerHim] to come to an end. I have met a good number of impatient people over the years, but [From.GetBestName] really seems determined to prove that [From.GetSheHe] is the most impatient of them all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1116;That really was not the plan...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1117;The spiritual guidance I am receiving from [From.GetBestName] is most helpful. I am starting to see how diligence would help me achieve my goals, and I am also starting to see how the goals I have set in the past have been far smaller than they really should have been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1117;I can achieve so much more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1118;[From.GetBestName] was known as someone that was content with what [From.GetSheHe] had back when I started to give [From.GetHerHim] spiritual guidance, but lately I have noted that that no longer seems to be the case, and though [From.GetHerHis] ambitions still are modest they are clearly growing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1118;Maybe it will pass...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1119;From time to time I have asked [From.GetBestName] about [From.GetHerHis] goals as it would be helpful to know them in order to show [From.GetHerHim] how diligence could be an advantage. The goals you have been told about have been growing for some time, and it has become clear that [From.GetBestName] has grand ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1119;This might be a problem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1120;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me spiritual guidance, but no matter how many lessons we have it really does not seem to be having any effect. I do my best to pay attention and to reflect on what I am being taught, but there has to be a problem somewhere as we are not making any progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1120;I must be doing something wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1121;I will try to improve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1121;I am not the problem here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1128;I'll be diligent from now on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1129;The spiritual guidance I have been proving [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. [From.GetSheHeCap] has without a doubt become quite diligent, and no further lessons are necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1129;[From.GetSheHeCap] was a good student!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1131;The spiritual guidance I am giving to [From.GetBestName] does not seem to be having much of an effect. Though I suppose that not everyone might change their ways quickly, I sometimes wonder whether it is pointless to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1134;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1136;As [From.GetBestName] continues to give me spiritual guidance related to patience I find myself wondering if I actually am going to find the lessons appealing at any point. I am not particularly patient, and maybe I should not try to change myself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1136;It would be a change for the better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1136;Actually, I don't want to change!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_1138;Though I have been doing my best to teach [From.GetBestName] how to be more patient, [From.GetSheHe] is not really making any progress. As best I can tell, [From.GetSheHe] is trying [From.GetHerHis] best, but considering [From.GetSheHe] definitely is not known for [From.GetHerHis] patience that might not be enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1138;At least [From.GetSheHe] is trying...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1139;Today [From.GetBestName] approached me to inform me that [From.GetSheHe] no longer is interested in receiving spiritual guidance from me, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] is content to remain the way [From.GetSheHe] is regardless of whether the Hwarang would approve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1139;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1140;Though it is unsurprising that it would require patience to learn about patience, I sometimes feel [From.GetBestName] is giving me spiritual guidance at a pace that is far too slow. Maybe this really is not for me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1140;It will be worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1140;I don't have the patience for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1141;Though I would have thought that [From.GetBestName] would have known that a certain amount of patience would be required when getting spiritual guidance related to patience, [From.GetSheHe] apparently does not possess enough patience for that, and has seen fit to tell me that [From.GetSheHe] does not want any further guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1141;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1142;The more spiritual guidance I get from [From.GetBestName], the more I realize that I have been working far too hard in general due to my impatience. Seeing as I am trying to become more patient, I should really take it more easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1142;I can relax a bit...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1143;[From.GetBestName] has in the past been a very attentive and diligent student, but lately [From.GetSheHe] seems to be working less hard. It is possible that [From.GetSheHe] is forgetting about diligence as a consequence of trying to become patient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1143;I'm not sure this is good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1144;I have come across many people that would try to work as little as possible over the years, but as of now I think that [From.GetBestName] might make most of them look good by comparison. It seems [From.GetSheHe] has confused the need for patience for a justification to be slothful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1144;This was not the plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1145;As [From.GetBestName] has been giving me lessons about patience I have started to realize that the goals I have set for myself in the past have been something that have made me impatient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1145;I should be more content!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1146;It seems [From.GetBestName] has learned other lessons from me than the ones I had intended, as [From.GetSheHe] seems to have become much less ambitious than [From.GetSheHe] used to be. Seeing as those ambitions might have led to strife with other Hwarang, that is probably good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1146;I must be doing something right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1147;It is becoming clearer and clearer that [From.GetBestName] is learning the value of being content even though I primarily had intended to teach the value of being patient. Without a doubt, this will make it easier for [From.GetHerHim] to get along with many other Hwarang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1147;I think this is for the best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1148;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me spiritual guidance, but no matter how many lessons we have it really does not seem to be having any effect.

EVTDESC_SOH_1160;Today [From.GetBestName] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it would be best for [From.GetHerHim] to stop giving me spiritual guidance even though I have not changed my ways as much as initially planned. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] thinks we are just wasting our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1160;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1162;After spending some time getting to know me better [From.GetBestName] has finally decided what kind of spiritual guidance [From.GetSheHe] can give me, and [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that the lessons will be on the topic of kindness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1162;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1164;As [From.GetBestName] continues to give me spiritual guidance related to kindness I find myself wondering if I actually am going to find the lessons appealing at any point. I am not particularly kind, and maybe I should not try to change myself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1164;It would be a change for the better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1164;Actually, I don't want to change!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1165;I have been having some difficulty teaching [From.GetBestName] how to be kinder, but at long last I can see some signs of progress. It will probably still be a while before [From.GetSheHe] has reached the point where it is prudent to end the lessons, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1165;I knew [From.GetSheHe] could do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1166;I have been having some difficulty teaching [From.GetBestName] how to be kinder, but at long last I can see some signs of progress. It will probably still be a while before [From.GetSheHe] has reached the point where it is prudent to end the lessons, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1166;I knew [From.GetSheHe] could do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1167;Though I have been doing my best to teach [From.GetBestName] how to be kinder, [From.GetSheHe] is not really making any progress. As best I can tell, [From.GetSheHe] is trying [From.GetHerHis] best, but considering [From.GetSheHe] definitely is not known for [From.GetHerHis] kindness that might not be enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1167;At least [From.GetSheHe] is trying...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1168;Today [From.GetBestName] approached me to inform me that [From.GetSheHe] no longer is interested in receiving spiritual guidance from me, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] is content to remain the way [From.GetSheHe] is regardless of whether the Hwarang would approve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1168;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1169;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me spiritual guidance on the topic of kindness, and the more I listen to [From.GetHerHis] words the more I realize that even the most just law is unlikely to be kind. If I am to be kind, a certain degree of flexibity when it comes to legal matters might be for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1169;It is better to be Good than Lawful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1170;When I started teaching [From.GetBestName] about the value of kindness, [From.GetSheHe] was known as someone that valued lawfulness. I thought it would be useful to show [From.GetHerHim] that being just without being kind is dangerous, but it seems [From.GetSheHe] is taking this the wrong way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1170;This is not going as expected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1171;Though [From.GetBestName] is making some progress towards becoming a kinder person [From.GetSheHe] also seems to be making progress towards being someone that does not respect the law. Understandably, the law cannot always be kind, but ignoring it in the name of kindness is still inappropriate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1171;Maybe my lessons are behind this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1172;Though [From.GetBestName] is not giving me spiritual guidance related to patience I am starting to realize that impatience sometimes can lead to unkind actions, and I have realized that this is something I wish to avoid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1172;I should be more patient...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1173;Lately I have noticed that [From.GetBestName] is more patient than [From.GetSheHe] used to be. Though my spiritual guidance has not been focused on the value of patience, I think this might be a side-effect of what I have been trying to teach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1173;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1174;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me spiritual guidance, but no matter how many lessons we have it really does not seem to be having any effect. I do my best to pay attention and to reflect on what I am being taught, but there has to be a problem somewhere as we are not making any progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1174;I must be doing something wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1174;[From.GetTitledName] is the problem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1175;[From.GetBestName] confronted me today, telling me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that the spiritual guidance I am providing is insufficient as [From.GetSheHe] really does not feel we are making any progress. [From.GetSheHeCap] asks that I consider what I can do better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1175;I will try to improve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1175;I am not the problem here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_1175;I just can't do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1176;[From.GetBestName] listened to what I had to say regarding our lessons not seeming to have an effect and informed me that [From.GetSheHe] will see what [From.GetSheHe] can do to improve, stating that [From.GetSheHe] is sorry [From.GetSheHe] has not been a better teacher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1176;I guess that's good enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1176;This has gone on long enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1177;I approached [From.GetBestName] and brought up the matter of [From.GetHerHis] lessons really not having an effect and that I thought that [From.GetSheHe] should do better. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] disagrees that [From.GetSheHe] is the problem, and suggests that I should consider what I am doing wrong instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1177;I suppose I could be at fault...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1177;I've had enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1178;I had expected [From.GetBestName] to either make excuses or tell me [From.GetSheHe] would work harder to provide me with useful spiritual guidance, but instead [From.GetSheHe] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] agrees that this is going nowhere and that it is time for our lessons to end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1178;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1179;It seems my response to [From.GetBestName] was not what [From.GetSheHe] wanted, as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that it is best for our lessons to end even though they have not had the desired effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1179;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1180;I have been receiving spiritual guidance from [From.GetBestName] for a while now, but I am starting to have second thoughts about the matter. I can see some value in the lessons I am being given at times, but at other times I feel it would be a mistake to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1180;I want to keep at it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1180;It is time to end this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1181;It seems [From.GetBestName] has grown tired of the spiritual guidance I have been providing as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it best for the lessons to end as they simply do not appeal to [From.GetHerHim] any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1181;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1182;The spiritual guidance I have been receiving from [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. I now see what [From.GetSheHe] has been trying to teach me all along, and looking back it is hard to believe I could ever have wanted to live a different way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1182;I'll be kind from now on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1183;The spiritual guidance I have been proving [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. [From.GetSheHeCap] has without a doubt become a kind person, and no further lessons are necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1183;[From.GetSheHeCap] was a good student!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1185;The spiritual guidance I am giving to [From.GetBestName] does not seem to be having much of an effect. Though I suppose that not everyone might change their ways quickly, I sometimes wonder whether it is pointless to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1185;I should keep at it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1185;This is pointless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1186;Today [From.GetBestName] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it would be best for [From.GetHerHim] to stop giving me spiritual guidance even though I have not changed my ways as much as initially planned.

EVTDESC_SOH_1188;After spending some time getting to know me better [From.GetBestName] has finally decided what kind of spiritual guidance [From.GetSheHe] can give me, and [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that the lessons will be on the topic of humility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1188;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1190;As [From.GetBestName] continues to give me spiritual guidance related to humility I find myself wondering if I actually am going to find the lessons appealing at any point. I am not particularly humble, and maybe I should not try to change myself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1190;It would be a change for the better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1190;Actually, I don't want to change!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1191;I have been having some difficulty teaching [From.GetBestName] how to be more humble, but at long last I can see some signs of progress. It will probably still be a while before [From.GetSheHe] has reached the point where it is prudent to end the lessons, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1191;I knew [From.GetSheHe] could do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1192;Though I have been doing my best to teach [From.GetBestName] how to be more humble, [From.GetSheHe] is not really making any progress. As best I can tell, [From.GetSheHe] is trying [From.GetHerHis] best, but considering [From.GetSheHe] definitely is not known for [From.GetHerHis] humility that might not be enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1193;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1194;As I hear more about the value of humility from [From.GetBestName] I am starting to reconsider whether I really need to work as hard as I have in the past. After all, if I should not be proud, I do not need to work hard to have something to be proud of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1194;Relaxing sounds good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1195;Lately I have noticed that [From.GetBestName] is not as diligent a student as [From.GetSheHe] used to be. I suspect that [From.GetSheHe] might be confusing my suggestion that [From.GetSheHe] should be less proud of [From.GetHerHis] work for a suggestion that [From.GetSheHe] should work less hard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1195;That is not quite what I expected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1196;As time goes on [From.GetBestName] is becoming more and more slothful. I have asked [From.GetHerHim] about it, and based on what [From.GetSheHe] has told me [From.GetSheHe] thinks that there is less need to work hard if being proud of your accomplishments is undesirable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1196;I didn't plan for this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1197;Though the Hwarang tend to put a lot of emphasis on their appearance, I have lately started to wonder if this is a mistake. [From.GetBestName] keeps telling me about the value of being humble, and I think it is easy to be prideful if you spend too much time focusing on your appearance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1197;Looks are unimportant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1198;In the past I have noticed [From.GetBestName] making an effort to ensure that [From.GetHerHis] appearance was impeccable. This seems to have changed recently, however, possibly as a result of my warnings that those that obsess about their looks at times might be prideful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1198;I suppose it could be worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1199;For the most part, the Hwarang tend to put a lot of effort into their looks. However, this cannot really be said about [From.GetBestName] any longer, and I think it is possible that this is due to some of the lessons that I have given being interpreted the wrong way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1199;This is not right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1200;I have been getting spiritual guidance related to humility for some time now, and it feels like I am making a lot of progress even if [From.GetBestName] tells me that I still have a lot to learn. Looking back, I am really proud at how far I have come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1200;Wait a second...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1201;Today I learned that [From.GetBestName] thinks that [From.GetSheHe] has experienced something of a setback when it comes to learning how to be humble. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] fell into the trap of being proud of how much progress [From.GetSheHe] had made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1201;That's a common mistake to make...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1202;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me spiritual guidance, but no matter how many lessons we have it really does not seem to be having any effect. I do my best to pay attention and to reflect on what I am being taught, but there has to be a problem somewhere as we are not making any progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1202;I must be doing something wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1202;[From.GetTitledName] is the problem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1203;I will try to improve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_SOH_1203;I just can't do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1204;[From.GetBestName] listened to what I had to say regarding our lessons not seeming to have an effect and informed me that [From.GetSheHe] will see what [From.GetSheHe] can do to improve, stating that [From.GetSheHe] is sorry [From.GetSheHe] has not been a better teacher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_1211;The spiritual guidance I have been proving [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. [From.GetSheHeCap] has without a doubt become a humble peron, and no further lessons are necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1211;[From.GetSheHeCap] was a good student!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1213;The spiritual guidance I am giving to [From.GetBestName] does not seem to be having much of an effect. Though I suppose that not everyone might change their ways quickly, I sometimes wonder whether it is pointless to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_1214;Today [From.GetBestName] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it would be best for [From.GetHerHim] to stop giving me spiritual guidance even though I have not changed my ways as much as initially planned. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] thinks we are just wasting our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1214;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1216;After spending some time getting to know me better [From.GetBestName] has finally decided what kind of spiritual guidance [From.GetSheHe] can give me, and [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that the lessons will be on the topic of bravery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1216;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1218;As [From.GetBestName] continues to give me spiritual guidance related to bravery I find myself wondering if I actually am going to find the lessons appealing at any point. I am not particularly brave, and maybe I should not try to change myself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1218;It would be a change for the better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1218;Actually, I don't want to change!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1219;I have been having some difficulty teaching [From.GetBestName] how to be braver, but at long last I can see some signs of progress. It will probably still be a while before [From.GetSheHe] has reached the point where it is prudent to end the lessons, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1219;I knew [From.GetSheHe] could do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1220;Though I have been doing my best to teach [From.GetBestName] how to be braver, [From.GetSheHe] is not really making any progress. As best I can tell, [From.GetSheHe] is trying [From.GetHerHis] best, but considering [From.GetSheHe] definitely is not known for [From.GetHerHis] bravery that might not be enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1221;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1222;Though the kind of bravery [From.GetBestName] is focusing on teaching me tends to have to do with the bravery that would be relevant on the battlefield, I am starting to realize that that is not the only place for bravery. In fact, my mistrust of others might be due to fear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1222;I should be more trusting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1223;When I first started giving spiritual guidance to [From.GetBestName] [From.GetSheHe] was quite paranoid and prone to suspecting the worst in people. This seems to have changed, however, and I think it is possible that this is a result of the lessons I have been giving on the subject of bravery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1223;This is a good thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1224;One of the things a Hwarang is supposed to be working towards is trusting their friends, and though I have noticed [From.GetBestName] not always doing this in the past this seems to have changed. It is possible that this is a positive side-effect of the spiritual guidance I have been giving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1224;This is surely for the best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1225;As [From.GetBestName] keeps giving me spiritual guidance on the topic of bravery I have found myself considering whether my lack of bravery might be due to not trusting that what happens happens for a reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1225;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] will keep me safe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1226;Though [From.GetBestName] has been paying attention during my lessons I have noticed that [From.GetSheHe] has been questioning the theological aspects of those lessons at times. This seems to have gone away recently, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1226;I suppose that might be good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1227;Though faith can be an advantage when it comes to bravery, I am starting to feel that [From.GetBestName] really is taking [From.GetHerHis] faith rather more seriously than [From.GetSheHe] probably should. This could potentially cause issues when it comes to cooperating with other Hwarang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1227;Maybe this has gone too far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1228;As I keep receiving spiritual guidance from [From.GetBestName] I am realizing that there have been times in the past where I have set far too modest goals for myself due to fear, and now that I am learning the value of bravery I can start working on this problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1228;I will not be held back by fear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1229;When I started teaching [From.GetBestName] about bravery [From.GetSheHe] had fairly modest ambitions, and at times it felt as if this was keeping [From.GetHerHim] back. However, I am starting to notice that [From.GetSheHe] is setting grander goals these days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1229;Maybe that will be helpful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1230;With each passing lesson, [From.GetBestName] is setting grander and grander goals for [From.GetHerselfHimself]. I suspect that this might be a side-effect of the lessons I am giving [From.GetHerHim] about the value of bravery, and I am not sure what to think of this change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1230;It could be for the worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1231;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me spiritual guidance, but no matter how many lessons we have it really does not seem to be having any effect. I do my best to pay attention and to reflect on what I am being taught, but there has to be a problem somewhere as we are not making any progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1231;I must be doing something wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_1236;It seems my response to [From.GetBestName] was not what [From.GetSheHe] wanted, as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that it is best for our lessons to end even though they have not had the desired effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1236;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1237;I have been receiving spiritual guidance from [From.GetBestName] for a while now, but I am starting to have second thoughts about the matter. I can see some value in the lessons I am being given at times, but at other times I feel it would be a mistake to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1237;I want to keep at it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1237;It is time to end this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1238;It seems [From.GetBestName] has grown tired of the spiritual guidance I have been providing as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it best for the lessons to end as they simply do not appeal to [From.GetHerHim] any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1238;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1239;The spiritual guidance I have been receiving from [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. I now see what [From.GetSheHe] has been trying to teach me all along, and looking back it is hard to believe I could ever have wanted to live a different way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1239;I'll be brave from now on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1240;The spiritual guidance I have been proving [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. [From.GetSheHeCap] has without a doubt become brave, and no further lessons are necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1240;[From.GetSheHeCap] was a good student!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1242;The spiritual guidance I am giving to [From.GetBestName] does not seem to be having much of an effect. Though I suppose that not everyone might change their ways quickly, I sometimes wonder whether it is pointless to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1242;I should keep at it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1242;This is pointless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1243;Today [From.GetBestName] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it would be best for [From.GetHerHim] to stop giving me spiritual guidance even though I have not changed my ways as much as initially planned. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] thinks we are just wasting our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1243;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1245;After spending some time getting to know me better [From.GetBestName] has finally decided what kind of spiritual guidance [From.GetSheHe] can give me, and [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that the lessons will be on the topic of contentness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1245;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1247;As [From.GetBestName] continues to give me spiritual guidance related to contentness I find myself wondering if I actually am going to find the lessons appealing at any point. I am not particularly content, and maybe I should not try to change myself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1247;It would be a change for the better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1247;Actually, I don't want to change!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1248;I have been having some difficulty teaching [From.GetBestName] how to be more content, but at long last I can see some signs of progress. It will probably still be a while before [From.GetSheHe] has reached the point where it is prudent to end the lessons, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1248;I knew [From.GetSheHe] could do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1249;Though I have been doing my best to teach [From.GetBestName] how to be more content, [From.GetSheHe] is not really making any progress. As best I can tell, [From.GetSheHe] is trying [From.GetHerHis] best, but considering [From.GetSheHe] definitely is not known for [From.GetHerHis] contentness that might not be enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1249;At least [From.GetSheHe] is trying...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1250;Today [From.GetBestName] approached me to inform me that [From.GetSheHe] no longer is interested in receiving spiritual guidance from me, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] is content to remain the way [From.GetSheHe] is regardless of whether the Hwarang would approve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1250;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1251;I have sometimes envied what others have in the past, and though [From.GetBestName]'s spiritual guidance has been focused on contentness I have started to realize that I really should try to be less envious in order to more easily be content.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1251;Begone, envy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1252;I have long thought that part of the reason why [From.GetBestName] struggles with being content is [From.GetHerHim] being envious of others, and though I have not mentioned this much during my lessons [From.GetSheHe] seems to have improved in this regard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1252;That's definitely good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1253;Ambition is sometimes a result of envy, and envy is of course undesirable by itself. Though I have not been addressing this much when teaching [From.GetBestName], [From.GetSheHe] really has turned into one of the least envious members of the Hwarang I have known.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1253;This is most welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1254;[From.GetBestName] keeps teaching me how to be more content, and the more spiritual guidance I receive on the topic the more I realize that I sometimes am not as content as I should be due to not thinking highly enough of what I already have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1254;I should be proud of what I have!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1255;When I started giving [From.GetBestName] spiritual guidance [From.GetSheHe] was very humble, but [From.GetSheHe] seems to be getting prouder. It is possible that this is a side-effect of what I have been teaching [From.GetHerHim], though I am not entirely certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1255;Maybe that is reasonable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1256;Though I can see how being overly humble might cause someone to find it hard to be content, [From.GetBestName] really seems to be taking my advice to be happy with what [From.GetSheHe] has as a justification to be proud, which is not something I really had expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1256;That's not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1257;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me spiritual guidance, but no matter how many lessons we have it really does not seem to be having any effect. I do my best to pay attention and to reflect on what I am being taught, but there has to be a problem somewhere as we are not making any progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1257;I must be doing something wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1257;[From.GetTitledName] is the problem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1258;[From.GetBestName] confronted me today, telling me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that the spiritual guidance I am providing is insufficient as [From.GetSheHe] really does not feel we are making any progress. [From.GetSheHeCap] asks that I consider what I can do better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1258;I will try to improve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1258;I am not the problem here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_1258;I just can't do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1259;[From.GetBestName] listened to what I had to say regarding our lessons not seeming to have an effect and informed me that [From.GetSheHe] will see what [From.GetSheHe] can do to improve, stating that [From.GetSheHe] is sorry [From.GetSheHe] has not been a better teacher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1259;I guess that's good enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1259;This has gone on long enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1260;I approached [From.GetBestName] and brought up the matter of [From.GetHerHis] lessons really not having an effect and that I thought that [From.GetSheHe] should do better. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] disagrees that [From.GetSheHe] is the problem, and suggests that I should consider what I am doing wrong instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1260;I suppose I could be at fault...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1260;I've had enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1261;I had expected [From.GetBestName] to either make excuses or tell me [From.GetSheHe] would work harder to provide me with useful spiritual guidance, but instead [From.GetSheHe] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] agrees that this is going nowhere and that it is time for our lessons to end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1265;I'll be content from now on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1266;The spiritual guidance I have been proving [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. [From.GetSheHeCap] has without a doubt become a content person, and no further lessons are necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_1268;The spiritual guidance I am giving to [From.GetBestName] does not seem to be having much of an effect. Though I suppose that not everyone might change their ways quickly, I sometimes wonder whether it is pointless to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1271;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1273;As [From.GetBestName] continues to give me spiritual guidance related to being gregarious I find myself wondering if I actually am going to find the lessons appealing at any point. I am not particularly gregarious, and maybe I should not try to change myself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1273;It would be a change for the better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1273;Actually, I don't want to change!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1276;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1277;As I receive more and more lessons regarding the value of speaking out and using words well, I am starting to realize that I sometimes have remained silent in the past when I should have been speaking up because I was fearful of offending someone. Clearly, this could easily have been the wrong move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1277;I should say what I think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1278;Though I am starting to make some progress when it comes to teaching [From.GetBestName] how to be more outspoken this seems to have had the side-effect of sometimes making [From.GetHerHim] say things that come across as a bit unkind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1278;Maybe it isn't all bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1279;The more I try to teach [From.GetBestName] about the value of speaking out the more [From.GetSheHe] seems to be willing to say whatever [From.GetSheHe] feels like saying, with little regard for whether [From.GetHerHis] words might upset someone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1279;This was not what I wanted...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1280;I have been receiving spiritual guidance from [From.GetBestName] for a while now, and [From.GetHerHis] lessons about being able to speak the words I need to say have made me realize that those words do not necessarily have to be the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1280;Lies are not always bad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1281;[From.GetBestName] has a reputation for honesty, and in the past I have had little reason to question this reputation. However, I have recently started to wonder whether this reputation still is deserved, seeing as [From.GetHerHis] words sometimes feel untrue to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1281;I suppose it could be worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1282;The spiritual guidance I am giving [From.GetBestName] is supposed to help [From.GetHerHim] become better at saying what [From.GetSheHe] needs to say, but I am starting to wonder if I might be teaching [From.GetHerHim] to be a liar rather than just a skilled orator.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1282;This is potentially a problem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1283;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me spiritual guidance, but no matter how many lessons we have it really does not seem to be having any effect. I do my best to pay attention and to reflect on what I am being taught, but there has to be a problem somewhere as we are not making any progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1299;It would be a change for the better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1299;Actually, I don't want to change!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1302;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1303;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me spiritual guidance on the topic of honesty, and with each passing lesson I feel more and more convinced that I have been in error when I have lied to avoid hurting someone's feelings. I really should try to avoid this in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1303;The truth hurts, but it is the truth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1304;I am making some progress teaching [From.GetBestName] to be honest, but it seems as if this has made [From.GetHerHim] more blunt in general, which sometimes makes [From.GetHerHis] words seem a bit unkind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1304;Maybe this is fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1305;[From.GetBestName] is definitely becoming more honest, but [From.GetSheHe] is also becoming somewhat cruel when it comes to [From.GetHerHis] words, seeing little reason to avoid blunt statements that would hurt someone's feelings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1305;This is a bit troubling...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1306;As [From.GetBestName] keeps giving me lessons related to honesty I am realizing that I at times have remained silent when I should not have been silent simply because I did not know if my honest opinion would have been of value.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1306;I should not be afraid to speak out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1307;I have been teaching [From.GetBestName] about honesty for a while now, and though progress at times leaves something to be desired I am noticing some pleasant side-effects. For one thing, [From.GetSheHe] is no longer as shy as [From.GetSheHe] used to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1307;That is rather welcome...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1308;As [From.GetBestName] is learning more about honesty [From.GetSheHe] seems to be getting more confident in [From.GetHerHis] oratory skills in general. Though being skilled with words potentially allows someone to lie, it is also an advantage when it comes to speaking the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1308;I think this is for the best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1309;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me spiritual guidance, but no matter how many lessons we have it really does not seem to be having any effect.

EVTDESC_SOH_1313;I had expected [From.GetBestName] to either make excuses or tell me [From.GetSheHe] would work harder to provide me with useful spiritual guidance, but instead [From.GetSheHe] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] agrees that this is going nowhere and that it is time for our lessons to end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1313;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1314;It seems my response to [From.GetBestName] was not what [From.GetSheHe] wanted, as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that it is best for our lessons to end even though they have not had the desired effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1314;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1315;I have been receiving spiritual guidance from [From.GetBestName] for a while now, but I am starting to have second thoughts about the matter. I can see some value in the lessons I am being given at times, but at other times I feel it would be a mistake to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1315;I want to keep at it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1315;It is time to end this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1316;It seems [From.GetBestName] has grown tired of the spiritual guidance I have been providing as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it best for the lessons to end as they simply do not appeal to [From.GetHerHim] any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1316;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1317;The spiritual guidance I have been receiving from [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. I now see what [From.GetSheHe] has been trying to teach me all along, and looking back it is hard to believe I could ever have wanted to live a different way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1317;I'll be honest from now on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1318;The spiritual guidance I have been proving [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. [From.GetSheHeCap] has without a doubt become an honest person, and no further lessons are necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1318;[From.GetSheHeCap] was a good student!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1320;The spiritual guidance I am giving to [From.GetBestName] does not seem to be having much of an effect. Though I suppose that not everyone might change their ways quickly, I sometimes wonder whether it is pointless to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1320;I should keep at it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1320;This is pointless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1321;Today [From.GetBestName] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it would be best for [From.GetHerHim] to stop giving me spiritual guidance even though I have not changed my ways as much as initially planned. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] thinks we are just wasting our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1321;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1323;After spending some time getting to know me better [From.GetBestName] has finally decided what kind of spiritual guidance [From.GetSheHe] can give me, and [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that the lessons will be on the topic of justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1323;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1325;As [From.GetBestName] continues to give me spiritual guidance related to justice I find myself wondering if I actually am going to find the lessons appealing at any point. I am not particularly just, and maybe I should not try to change myself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1325;It would be a change for the better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1325;Actually, I don't want to change!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1326;I have been having some difficulty teaching [From.GetBestName] how to be more just, but at long last I can see some signs of progress. It will probably still be a while before [From.GetSheHe] has reached the point where it is prudent to end the lessons, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1326;I knew [From.GetSheHe] could do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1327;Though I have been doing my best to teach [From.GetBestName] how to be more just, [From.GetSheHe] is not really making any progress. As best I can tell, [From.GetSheHe] is trying [From.GetHerHis] best, but considering [From.GetSheHe] definitely is not known for [From.GetHerHis] justice that might not be enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1327;At least [From.GetSheHe] is trying...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1328;Today [From.GetBestName] approached me to inform me that [From.GetSheHe] no longer is interested in receiving spiritual guidance from me, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] is content to remain the way [From.GetSheHe] is regardless of whether the Hwarang would approve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1328;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1329;As I keep receiving spiritual guidance related to the topic of justice from [From.GetBestName] I am realizing that the law does not always allow for kindness, and though kindness generally is seen as a good thing it is clear that the law should take precedence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1329;I'd rather be Lawful than Good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1330;When I started giving [From.GetBestName] spiritual guidance [From.GetSheHe] was widely regarded as a kind person. However, it seems [From.GetSheHe] sees less value in kindness these days, possibly as a consequence of trying to learn to be more impartial due to my lessons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1330;I suppose that's to be expected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1331;Though I feel I am making [From.GetBestName] see the value of justice, I fear [From.GetSheHe] also is starting to lose [From.GetHerHim] appreciation of kindness. I know very well that sometimes the law does not allow for kindness, but [From.GetSheHe] really seems to be taking this too far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1331;This is not what I intended...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1332;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me spiritual guidance, but no matter how many lessons we have it really does not seem to be having any effect. I do my best to pay attention and to reflect on what I am being taught, but there has to be a problem somewhere as we are not making any progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1332;I must be doing something wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1332;[From.GetTitledName] is the problem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1333;[From.GetBestName] confronted me today, telling me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that the spiritual guidance I am providing is insufficient as [From.GetSheHe] really does not feel we are making any progress. [From.GetSheHeCap] asks that I consider what I can do better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1333;I will try to improve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1333;I am not the problem here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_1333;I just can't do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1334;[From.GetBestName] listened to what I had to say regarding our lessons not seeming to have an effect and informed me that [From.GetSheHe] will see what [From.GetSheHe] can do to improve, stating that [From.GetSheHe] is sorry [From.GetSheHe] has not been a better teacher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1334;I guess that's good enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1334;This has gone on long enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1335;I approached [From.GetBestName] and brought up the matter of [From.GetHerHis] lessons really not having an effect and that I thought that [From.GetSheHe] should do better. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] disagrees that [From.GetSheHe] is the problem, and suggests that I should consider what I am doing wrong instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1335;I suppose I could be at fault...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1335;I've had enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1336;I had expected [From.GetBestName] to either make excuses or tell me [From.GetSheHe] would work harder to provide me with useful spiritual guidance, but instead [From.GetSheHe] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] agrees that this is going nowhere and that it is time for our lessons to end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1340;I'll be just from now on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1341;The spiritual guidance I have been proving [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. [From.GetSheHeCap] has without a doubt become a just person, and no further lessons are necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1346;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1348;As [From.GetBestName] continues to give me spiritual guidance related to trust I find myself wondering if I actually am going to find the lessons appealing at any point. I am not particularly just, and maybe I should not try to change myself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1350;At least [From.GetSheHe] is trying...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1351;Today [From.GetBestName] approached me to inform me that [From.GetSheHe] no longer is interested in receiving spiritual guidance from me, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] is content to remain the way [From.GetSheHe] is regardless of whether the Hwarang would approve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1351;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1352;I keep getting lessons from [From.GetBestName] concerning trust, and I am starting to believe that part of why I do not trust people is that I know I talk a lot and always feel the need to consider just what I am saying and how others might think of me based on my words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1352;I could speak less...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1353;I have known [From.GetBestName] for a while, and [From.GetSheHe] has usually been good with words. However, recently I have noted that [From.GetSheHe] seems less eager to speak to others, and I am not sure if this is due to something I accidentally have told [From.GetHerHim] or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1353;Well, maybe it will help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1354;The more time I spend in [From.GetBestName]'s presence the more I notice that [From.GetSheHe] seems to be getting shyer and shyer. I think we are making some progress when it comes to trust, but it is a bit hard to tell when [From.GetSheHe] rarely speaks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1354;This is unexpected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1355;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me spiritual guidance, but no matter how many lessons we have it really does not seem to be having any effect.

EVTDESC_SOH_1364;The spiritual guidance I have been proving [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. [From.GetSheHeCap] has without a doubt become quite trusting, and no further lessons are necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1364;[From.GetSheHeCap] was a good student!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1366;The spiritual guidance I am giving to [From.GetBestName] does not seem to be having much of an effect. Though I suppose that not everyone might change their ways quickly, I sometimes wonder whether it is pointless to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1369;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1371;As [From.GetBestName] continues to give me spiritual guidance related to zeal I find myself wondering if I actually am going to find the lessons appealing at any point. I am not particularly zealous, and maybe I should not try to change myself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1374;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1375;[From.GetBestName] keeps teaching me about the value of zeal, but [From.GetSheHe] follows the [From.Religion.GetName] faith rather than the [Root.Religion.GetName]. Am I really supposed to learn zeal from [From.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1375;[From.GetHerHisCap] faith is the true faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1375;I can't accept any more lessons from [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_1375;[From.GetHerHis] faith is a false faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1376;I have been trying to teach [From.GetBestName] the value of zeal for a while now, and there have been some difficulties due to [From.GetHerHim] not sharing my faith. However, today [From.GetSheHe] informed me that I have convinced [From.GetHerHim] to convert.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1376;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1377;I have been trying to teach [From.GetBestName] the value of zeal for a while now, and there have been some difficulties due to [From.GetHerHim] not sharing my faith. Today [From.GetSheHe] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] does not think it is appropriate for me to try to teach [From.GetHerHim] about zeal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1377;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1378;I have been trying to teach [From.GetBestName] the value of zeal for a while now, and there have been some difficulties due to [From.GetHerHim] not sharing my faith. [From.GetSheHeCap] has certainly become zealous, but [From.GetSheHe] has also kept [From.GetHerHis] own faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1378;That's not what I was going for...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1379;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me lessons about zeal, and I am starting to see some value in it. In the past, I feel I have doubted because I was not really proud of being someone following the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, but now I think I see why I should be proud of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1379;I should be proud of my faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1380;I have been teaching [From.GetBestName] about the value of zeal for a while, and at times it has felt as if [From.GetSheHe] did not think zeal was something to be proud of. This seems to have changed, though [From.GetSheHe] also seems to have become less humble overall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1380;I suppose that's fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1381;Though [From.GetBestName] certainly is becoming more zealous, [From.GetSheHe] is also becoming a lot prouder. It is possible that [From.GetSheHe] has learned the wrong lesson due to me telling [From.GetHerHim] that there is little wrong with being proud of your faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1381;Not quite as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1382;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me spiritual guidance, but no matter how many lessons we have it really does not seem to be having any effect.

EVTOPTB_SOH_1388;It is time to end this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1389;It seems [From.GetBestName] has grown tired of the spiritual guidance I have been providing as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it best for the lessons to end as they simply do not appeal to [From.GetHerHim] any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1389;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1390;The spiritual guidance I have been receiving from [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. I now see what [From.GetSheHe] has been trying to teach me all along, and looking back it is hard to believe I could ever have wanted to live a different way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1390;I'll be zealous from now on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1391;The spiritual guidance I have been proving [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. [From.GetSheHeCap] has without a doubt become a zealot, and no further lessons are necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1391;[From.GetSheHeCap] was a good student!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1393;The spiritual guidance I am giving to [From.GetBestName] does not seem to be having much of an effect. Though I suppose that not everyone might change their ways quickly, I sometimes wonder whether it is pointless to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1393;I should keep at it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1393;This is pointless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1394;Today [From.GetBestName] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it would be best for [From.GetHerHim] to stop giving me spiritual guidance even though I have not changed my ways as much as initially planned. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] thinks we are just wasting our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1394;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1396;After spending some time getting to know me better [From.GetBestName] has finally decided what kind of spiritual guidance [From.GetSheHe] can give me, and [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that the lessons will be on the topic of chastity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1396;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1398;As [From.GetBestName] continues to give me spiritual guidance related to chastity I find myself wondering if I actually am going to find the lessons useful at any point. I am already rather chaste, and maybe this is a waste of my time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1398;These lessons might actually be good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1398;I think we are done here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1399;I have been having some difficulty teaching [From.GetBestName] that chastity is not a good thing, but at long last I can see some signs of progress. It will probably still be a while before [From.GetSheHe] has reached the point where it is prudent to end the lessons, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1399;I knew I could do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1400;Though I have been doing my best to teach [From.GetBestName] that chastity is not a good thing, [From.GetSheHe] is not really making any progress. Since [From.GetSheHe] is known for [From.GetHerHis] chastity, this is hardly surprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1400;I suppose I need to work harder...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1401;Today [From.GetBestName] approached me to inform me that [From.GetSheHe] no longer is interested in receiving spiritual guidance from me, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] thinks [From.GetSheHe] knows quite a bit about the topic already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1401;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1402;As [From.GetBestName] continues to give me spiritual guidance related to chastity I find myself wondering if I actually am going to find the lessons useful at any point. I am already celibate, and maybe this is a waste of my time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_1406;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me lessons that supposedly are about chastity, but the more I hear from [From.GetHerHim] the more convinced I become that [From.GetSheHe] actually is trying to make me find chastity less appealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1406;Something is not quite right here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1407;Today [From.GetBestName] confronted me, asking if I am lying to [From.GetHerHim] about teaching [From.GetHerHim] about chastity. It is possible I could convince [From.GetHerHim] that I am not lying, but it might be risky to attempt it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1407;So what if I lied?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1407;I mean well, I assure you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_1407;I can't teach you if you're this ungrateful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1408;To my surprise, [From.GetBestName] admitted that [From.GetSheHe] has been lying to me about what [From.GetSheHe] was trying to teach me when I confronted [From.GetHerHim].

EVTOPTA_SOH_1408;This ends now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1409;I asked [From.GetBestName] if [From.GetSheHe] really had been trying to give me lessons on the topic [From.GetSheHe] had been claiming to be trying to teach me, and [From.GetSheHe] did [From.GetHerHis] best to assure me that everything will make sense in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1409;I suppose you know best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1409;You lie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1410;[From.GetBestName] did not take me inqiring about the content of [From.GetHerHis] lessons well, and declared that I was a most ungrateful student that [From.GetSheHe] is unwilling to try to teach anything further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1410;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1411;It seems [From.GetBestName] saw through my lies about the lessons I have been giving [From.GetHerHim], as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] considers me a liar and no longer wishes to receive any lessons from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1460;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1462;As [From.GetBestName] continues to give me spiritual guidance related to diligence I find myself wondering if I actually am going to find the lessons useful at any point. I am already rather diligent, and maybe this is a waste of my time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SOH_1462;I think we are done here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1463;I have been having some difficulty teaching [From.GetBestName] that diligence is not a good thing, but at long last I can see some signs of progress.

EVTOPTA_SOH_1465;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1466;[From.GetBestName]'s spiritual guidance has made me realize that there is a danger in overworking myself and getting stressed due to the goals I set for myself. Considering the Hwarang disapprove of ambition, I should probably have considered this sooner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1466;I could be more content...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1467;Though I have been trying to make [From.GetBestName] become more slothful I have apparently also managed to teach [From.GetHerHim] other things. It seems [From.GetSheHe] no longer sees ambition as a great thing, which might please the Hwarang as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1467;I suppose that's fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1468;As a side-effect of my lessons, [From.GetBestName] seems to have become rather more content with what [From.GetSheHe] has. Doubtlessly, the Hwarang as a whole will approve of this change, even if it is not the change I was going for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1468;Maybe that is good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1469;[From.GetBestName]'s lessons have mainly been concerned with diligence and the dangers of taking it too far, and I have started to realize that it is possible to work too hard due to being impatient. Given that the Hwarang approve of patience, I should have seen this sooner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1469;I should be more patient...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1470;It seems [From.GetBestName] has become quite a bit less impatient since I started trying to convince [From.GetHerHim] of the dangers of diligence. Doubtlessly, the Hwarang as a whole will approve of this change, even if it was not something I planned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1470;I can live with that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1471;[From.GetBestName] has become quite patient as of late, possibly as a side-effect of my lessons. Given that someone that is impatient be more diligent due to wanting to achieve something sooner, it could be a sign of progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1471;This might be helpful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1472;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me lessons that supposedly are about diligence, but the more I hear from [From.GetHerHim] the more convinced I become that [From.GetSheHe] actually is trying to make me find diligence less appealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_1473;Today [From.GetBestName] confronted me, asking if I am lying to [From.GetHerHim] about teaching [From.GetHerHim] about diligence. It is possible I could convince [From.GetHerHim] that I am not lying, but it might be risky to attempt it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1473;So what if I lied?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1473;I mean well, I assure you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_1473;I can't teach you if you're this ungrateful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1474;To my surprise, [From.GetBestName] admitted that [From.GetSheHe] has been lying to me about what [From.GetSheHe] was trying to teach me when I confronted [From.GetHerHim]. It is abundantly clear that I cannot accept any more lessons from [From.GetHerHim] at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1474;This ends now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1475;I asked [From.GetBestName] if [From.GetSheHe] really had been trying to give me lessons on the topic [From.GetSheHe] had been claiming to be trying to teach me, and [From.GetSheHe] did [From.GetHerHis] best to assure me that everything will make sense in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1475;I suppose you know best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1475;You lie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1476;[From.GetBestName] did not take me inqiring about the content of [From.GetHerHis] lessons well, and declared that I was a most ungrateful student that [From.GetSheHe] is unwilling to try to teach anything further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1476;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1477;It seems [From.GetBestName] saw through my lies about the lessons I have been giving [From.GetHerHim], as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] considers me a liar and no longer wishes to receive any lessons from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1477;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1478;I have been receiving spiritual guidance from [From.GetBestName] for a while now, but I am starting to have second thoughts about the matter. I can see some value in the lessons I am being given at times, but at other times I feel it would be a mistake to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1478;I want to keep at it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1478;It is time to end this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1479;It seems [From.GetBestName] has grown tired of the spiritual guidance I have been providing as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it best for the lessons to end as they simply do not appeal to [From.GetHerHim] any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1479;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1480;The spiritual guidance I have been receiving from [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. I now see what [From.GetSheHe] has been trying to teach me all along, and looking back it is hard to believe I could ever have wanted to live a different way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1480;Diligence is foolish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1481;The spiritual guidance I have been proving [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. [From.GetSheHeCap] has without a doubt become slothful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1481;Just as I intended!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1483;The spiritual guidance I am giving to [From.GetBestName] does not seem to be having much of an effect. Though I suppose that not everyone might change their ways quickly, I sometimes wonder whether it is pointless to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1483;I should keep at it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1483;This is pointless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1484;Today [From.GetBestName] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it would be best for [From.GetHerHim] to stop giving me spiritual guidance even though I have not changed my ways as much as initially planned. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] thinks we are just wasting our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1484;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1486;After spending some time getting to know me better [From.GetBestName] has finally decided what kind of spiritual guidance [From.GetSheHe] can give me, and [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that the lessons will be on the topic of patience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1486;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1488;As [From.GetBestName] continues to give me spiritual guidance related to patience I find myself wondering if I actually am going to find the lessons useful at any point. I am already rather patient, and maybe this is a waste of my time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1488;These lessons might actually be good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1488;I think we are done here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1489;I have been having some difficulty teaching [From.GetBestName] that patience is not a good thing, but at long last I can see some signs of progress. It will probably still be a while before [From.GetSheHe] has reached the point where it is prudent to end the lessons, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1489;I knew I could do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1490;Though I have been doing my best to teach [From.GetBestName] that patience is not a good thing, [From.GetSheHe] is not really making any progress. Since [From.GetSheHe] is known for [From.GetHerHis] patience, this is hardly surprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1490;I suppose I need to work harder...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1491;Today [From.GetBestName] approached me to inform me that [From.GetSheHe] no longer is interested in receiving spiritual guidance from me, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] thinks [From.GetSheHe] knows quite a bit about the topic already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1491;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1492;I have been receiving spiritual guidance from [From.GetBestName] for a while now, and [From.GetSheHe] has several times brought up the need to consider how patience can be detrimental at times, such as when it comes to it being an excuse to be slothful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1492;I must work harder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1493;[From.GetBestName] has been rather slothful in the past, but seems to have become rather less so recently. It is possible that my lessons about the need to be less patient is what has caused this change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1493;Maybe it'll help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1494;[From.GetBestName] has really become a diligent student as of late. It is possible this is a result of my attempt to persuade [From.GetHerHim] that patience is not as great as [From.GetSheHe] thinks it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1494;I suppose it could be useful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1495;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me lessons that supposedly are about patience, but the more I hear from [From.GetHerHim] the more convinced I become that [From.GetSheHe] actually is trying to make me find patience less appealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1496;So what if I lied?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1496;I mean well, I assure you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1504;Just as I intended!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1506;The spiritual guidance I am giving to [From.GetBestName] does not seem to be having much of an effect. Though I suppose that not everyone might change their ways quickly, I sometimes wonder whether it is pointless to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1514;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1515;[From.GetBestName] has been teaching me about kindness for a while now, and though some of the lessons have been a bit strange I really feel that [From.GetSheHe] has a point when [From.GetSheHe] says that the law must be followed even if it is a bit unkind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1515;I should definitely be Lawful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1516;As part of my attempt to teach [From.GetBestName] that kindness is not as good as [From.GetSheHe] thinks it is I have pointed out that the Hwarang generally strive to follow the law even if it is a bit unkind, and [From.GetBestName] seems to have more interest in following the law these days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1516;I suppose it is reasonable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1517;While I have brought up how the law cannot always afford to be kind in my attempt to make [From.GetBestName] think less highly of kindness, I had not expected [From.GetHerHim] to decide that [From.GetSheHe] really must act in a just manner at all times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1517;I guess I should have seen this coming...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1518;[From.GetBestName]'s spiritual guidance has made me realize that I at times am rather too unwilling to pursue my goals because I perceive it as being unkind, and that those goals sometimes would be well worth pursuing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1518;I can't afford to be content!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1519;There was a time when I would have struggled to find someone more content than [From.GetBestName], but that has changed recently. Maybe [From.GetSheHe] has learned a different lesson than I expected when I told [From.GetHerHim] that [From.GetHerHis] kindness might stand in the way of [From.GetHerHis] goals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1519;Not quite what I expected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1520;While my attempt to make [From.GetBestName] more envious still has not gone quite as well as I would have liked [From.GetSheHe] seems to have become quite ambitious as of late. I suppose I can see how that could have happened, even if that was not my intention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1520;Maybe this will help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1521;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me lessons that supposedly are about kindness, but the more I hear from [From.GetHerHim] the more convinced I become that [From.GetSheHe] actually is trying to make me find patience less appealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_1529;The spiritual guidance I have been receiving from [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. I now see what [From.GetSheHe] has been trying to teach me all along, and looking back it is hard to believe I could ever have wanted to live a different way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1529;Kindness is foolish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1530;The spiritual guidance I have been proving [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. [From.GetSheHeCap] has without a doubt become very envious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1530;Just as I intended!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1532;The spiritual guidance I am giving to [From.GetBestName] does not seem to be having much of an effect. Though I suppose that not everyone might change their ways quickly, I sometimes wonder whether it is pointless to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] thinks we are just wasting our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1533;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1535;After spending some time getting to know me better [From.GetBestName] has finally decided what kind of spiritual guidance [From.GetSheHe] can give me, and [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that the lessons will be on the topic of humility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1535;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1537;As [From.GetBestName] continues to give me spiritual guidance related to humility I find myself wondering if I actually am going to find the lessons useful at any point. I am already rather humble, and maybe this is a waste of my time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1537;These lessons might actually be good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1537;I think we are done here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1538;I have been having some difficulty teaching [From.GetBestName] that humility is not a good thing, but at long last I can see some signs of progress. It will probably still be a while before [From.GetSheHe] has reached the point where it is prudent to end the lessons, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1540;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1541;I have been getting spiritual guidance from [From.GetBestName] for a while now, and as [From.GetSheHe] has mentioned that my humility sometimes might keep me from realizing that my ambitions are unseemly for a member of the Hwarang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1541;I can be more content!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1542;It seems [From.GetBestName] has come to the conclusion that [From.GetHerHis] ambitions are unseemly and have started to reconsider them. It is very possible that [From.GetSheHe] has come to this conclusion due to my lessons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1542;Not quite was I was going for...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1543;[From.GetBestName] has really become content lately, quite possibly as a result of my lessons. Given that I was hoping to make [From.GetHerHim] realize that humility is undesirable, this is not really according to plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1543;This might be unhelpful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1544;[From.GetBestName] has been giving me spiritual guidance related to humility for a while now, and though I think I might have made some progress it is very possible that I have not made as much progress as I think I have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1544;I should not be proud of my progress...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1545;Despite my intentions it seems like [From.GetBestName] is becoming a bit more humble as time goes on. Given that I am trying to teach [From.GetHerHim] the value of being proud, this is certainly a setback.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1545;I must be doing something wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1546;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me lessons that supposedly are about humility, but the more I hear from [From.GetHerHim] the more convinced I become that [From.GetSheHe] actually is trying to make me find humility less appealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1546;Something is not quite right here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1547;Today [From.GetBestName] confronted me, asking if I am lying to [From.GetHerHim] about teaching [From.GetHerHim] about humility. It is possible I could convince [From.GetHerHim] that I am not lying, but it might be risky to attempt it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1547;So what if I lied?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1547;I mean well, I assure you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_1547;I can't teach you if you're this ungrateful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1548;To my surprise, [From.GetBestName] admitted that [From.GetSheHe] has been lying to me about what [From.GetSheHe] was trying to teach me when I confronted [From.GetHerHim]. It is abundantly clear that I cannot accept any more lessons from [From.GetHerHim] at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1548;This ends now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1549;I asked [From.GetBestName] if [From.GetSheHe] really had been trying to give me lessons on the topic [From.GetSheHe] had been claiming to be trying to teach me, and [From.GetSheHe] did [From.GetHerHis] best to assure me that everything will make sense in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1549;I suppose you know best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1549;You lie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1550;[From.GetBestName] did not take me inqiring about the content of [From.GetHerHis] lessons well, and declared that I was a most ungrateful student that [From.GetSheHe] is unwilling to try to teach anything further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1550;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1551;It seems [From.GetBestName] saw through my lies about the lessons I have been giving [From.GetHerHim], as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] considers me a liar and no longer wishes to receive any lessons from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1551;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1552;I have been receiving spiritual guidance from [From.GetBestName] for a while now, but I am starting to have second thoughts about the matter. I can see some value in the lessons I am being given at times, but at other times I feel it would be a mistake to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1552;I want to keep at it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1552;It is time to end this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1553;It seems [From.GetBestName] has grown tired of the spiritual guidance I have been providing as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it best for the lessons to end as they simply do not appeal to [From.GetHerHim] any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1553;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1554;The spiritual guidance I have been receiving from [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. I now see what [From.GetSheHe] has been trying to teach me all along, and looking back it is hard to believe I could ever have wanted to live a different way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1554;Humility is foolish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1555;The spiritual guidance I have been proving [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. [From.GetSheHeCap] has without a doubt become quite proud of [From.GetHerselfHimself].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1555;Just as I intended!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1557;The spiritual guidance I am giving to [From.GetBestName] does not seem to be having much of an effect. Though I suppose that not everyone might change their ways quickly, I sometimes wonder whether it is pointless to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1557;I should keep at it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1557;This is pointless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1558;Today [From.GetBestName] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it would be best for [From.GetHerHim] to stop giving me spiritual guidance even though I have not changed my ways as much as initially planned. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] thinks we are just wasting our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1558;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1560;After spending some time getting to know me better [From.GetBestName] has finally decided what kind of spiritual guidance [From.GetSheHe] can give me, and [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that the lessons will be on the topic of justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1560;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1562;As [From.GetBestName] continues to give me spiritual guidance related to justice I find myself wondering if I actually am going to find the lessons useful at any point. I am already rather just, and maybe this is a waste of my time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1562;These lessons might actually be good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1562;I think we are done here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1563;I have been having some difficulty teaching [From.GetBestName] that justice is not a good thing, but at long last I can see some signs of progress. It will probably still be a while before [From.GetSheHe] has reached the point where it is prudent to end the lessons, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1563;I knew I could do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1564;Though I have been doing my best to teach [From.GetBestName] that justice is not a good thing, [From.GetSheHe] is not really making any progress. Since [From.GetSheHe] is known for [From.GetHerHis] justice, this is hardly surprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1564;I suppose I need to work harder...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1565;Today [From.GetBestName] approached me to inform me that [From.GetSheHe] no longer is interested in receiving spiritual guidance from me, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] thinks [From.GetSheHe] knows quite a bit about the topic already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1565;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1566;[From.GetBestName]'s spiritual guidance has been on the topic of justice, but as [From.GetSheHe] is fond of pointing out justice is hardly the only thing that should matter to a member of the Hwarang. Sometimes the law can be unreasonably cruel, and in those situations following the law might be wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1566;It is better to be Good than Lawful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1567;[From.GetBestName] used to be rather cruel in the past, and I had thought that this might have been something that could convince [From.GetHerHim] that the law is not all-important. However, to my surprise [From.GetSheHe] seems to have become kinder instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1567;That's a bit unexpected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1568;As time goes on it seems as if [From.GetBestName] is putting more and more effort into being kind even though my lessons have been concerned with pointing out flaws related to various laws and how they clearly are unkind at times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1568;Maybe it will be useful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1569;[From.GetBestName] has from time to time pointed out to me how various laws make little sense when examined more closely. Though I am not entirely convinced of this I have also examined other things more closely as of recently, and the [Root.Religion.GetName] contains a lot more contradictions than I once thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1569;Maybe my faith is wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1570;[From.GetBestName] has come across as a zealous believer in the [From.Religion.GetName] faith in the past, but as of late [From.GetHerHis] zeal seems to have diminished quite a bit. I do not know if it is due to my lessons or not, but it is certainly not something I intended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1570;It could be for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1571;Though it is useful for me if [From.GetBestName] questions what [From.GetSheHe] once believed if I want [From.GetHerHim] to stop being a strong believer in the rule of law, [From.GetSheHe] really is questioning [From.GetHerHis] faith a lot as of recently, and I am not sure that is beneficial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1571;It was certainly not the plan...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1572;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me lessons that supposedly are about justice, but the more I hear from [From.GetHerHim] the more convinced I become that [From.GetSheHe] actually is trying to make me find justice less appealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1572;Something is not quite right here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1573;Today [From.GetBestName] confronted me, asking if I am lying to [From.GetHerHim] about teaching [From.GetHerHim] about justice. It is possible I could convince [From.GetHerHim] that I am not lying, but it might be risky to attempt it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1573;So what if I lied?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1573;I mean well, I assure you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_1573;I can't teach you if you're this ungrateful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1574;To my surprise, [From.GetBestName] admitted that [From.GetSheHe] has been lying to me about what [From.GetSheHe] was trying to teach me when I confronted [From.GetHerHim]. It is abundantly clear that I cannot accept any more lessons from [From.GetHerHim] at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1574;This ends now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1575;I asked [From.GetBestName] if [From.GetSheHe] really had been trying to give me lessons on the topic [From.GetSheHe] had been claiming to be trying to teach me, and [From.GetSheHe] did [From.GetHerHis] best to assure me that everything will make sense in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1575;I suppose you know best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1575;You lie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1576;[From.GetBestName] did not take me inqiring about the content of [From.GetHerHis] lessons well, and declared that I was a most ungrateful student that [From.GetSheHe] is unwilling to try to teach anything further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1576;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1577;It seems [From.GetBestName] saw through my lies about the lessons I have been giving [From.GetHerHim], as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] considers me a liar and no longer wishes to receive any lessons from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1577;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1578;I have been receiving spiritual guidance from [From.GetBestName] for a while now, but I am starting to have second thoughts about the matter. I can see some value in the lessons I am being given at times, but at other times I feel it would be a mistake to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1578;I want to keep at it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1578;It is time to end this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1579;It seems [From.GetBestName] has grown tired of the spiritual guidance I have been providing as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it best for the lessons to end as they simply do not appeal to [From.GetHerHim] any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1580;Justice is foolish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1581;The spiritual guidance I have been proving [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. [From.GetSheHeCap] has without a doubt become quite arbitrary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1581;Just as I intended!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1583;The spiritual guidance I am giving to [From.GetBestName] does not seem to be having much of an effect. Though I suppose that not everyone might change their ways quickly, I sometimes wonder whether it is pointless to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1584;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1586;After spending some time getting to know me better [From.GetBestName] has finally decided what kind of spiritual guidance [From.GetSheHe] can give me, and [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that the lessons will be on the topic of bravery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1586;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1588;As [From.GetBestName] continues to give me spiritual guidance related to bravery I find myself wondering if I actually am going to find the lessons useful at any point. I am already rather brave, and maybe this is a waste of my time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1588;These lessons might actually be good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1588;I think we are done here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1589;I have been having some difficulty teaching [From.GetBestName] that bravery is not a good thing, but at long last I can see some signs of progress. It will probably still be a while before [From.GetSheHe] has reached the point where it is prudent to end the lessons, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1589;I knew I could do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1591;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1592;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me spiritual guidance related to bravery, and [From.GetSheHe] has several times pointed out that too much bravery is foolish. I suspect that [From.GetSheHe] mainly was referring to situations on the battlefield, but it is certainly applicable in other contexts too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1592;I really am too trusting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1593;[From.GetBestName] used to be so trusting most would have called [From.GetHerHim] a bit too gullible, which I certainly thought would be an advantage when it came to my plans, but [From.GetSheHe] seems to have become a bit less gullible as of late. Maybe it is as a consequence of my lectures, but maybe not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1593;This was not the plan...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1594;As time goes on [From.GetBestName] gets less and less trusting. Doubtlessly, the Hwarang will not be pleased by this, and it is also possible that this will interfere with my plans as [From.GetSheHe] might suspect that I am not teaching [From.GetHerHim] what I claim to be teaching [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1594;This could be a problem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1595;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me lessons that supposedly are about bravery, but the more I hear from [From.GetHerHim] the more convinced I become that [From.GetSheHe] actually is trying to make me find bravery less appealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_1635;I have been receiving spiritual guidance from [From.GetBestName] for a while now, and [From.GetSheHe] has repeatedly made it clear that [From.GetSheHe] is of the opinion that zeal often is pride in disguise. Pride is certainly undesirable, and I have done my best to become less proud as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1635;Humility is far better than pride!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1636;I have been giving [From.GetBestName] spiritual guidance for a while now, and as part of my attempt to teach [From.GetHerHim] to be less zealous I have pointed out that many that are zealous also are proud, and that pride is undesirable in a member of the Hwarang. [From.GetSheHeCap] certainly seems to have become less proud as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1636;This might be useful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1637;As I keep giving [From.GetBestName] spiritual guidance [From.GetSheHe] seems to become more and more humble. My goal is to make [From.GetHerHim] less zealous, so this is not quite what I had planned, but a humble student is more likely to listen to my words than a prideful one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1637;That's likely helpful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1638;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me lessons that supposedly are about zeal, but the more I hear from [From.GetHerHim] the more convinced I become that [From.GetSheHe] actually is trying to make me find zeal less appealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1638;Something is not quite right here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1639;Today [From.GetBestName] confronted me, asking if I am lying to [From.GetHerHim] about teaching [From.GetHerHim] about zeal. It is possible I could convince [From.GetHerHim] that I am not lying, but it might be risky to attempt it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1639;So what if I lied?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1639;I mean well, I assure you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_1639;I can't teach you if you're this ungrateful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1640;To my surprise, [From.GetBestName] admitted that [From.GetSheHe] has been lying to me about what [From.GetSheHe] was trying to teach me when I confronted [From.GetHerHim]. It is abundantly clear that I cannot accept any more lessons from [From.GetHerHim] at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1640;This ends now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1641;I asked [From.GetBestName] if [From.GetSheHe] really had been trying to give me lessons on the topic [From.GetSheHe] had been claiming to be trying to teach me, and [From.GetSheHe] did [From.GetHerHis] best to assure me that everything will make sense in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1641;I suppose you know best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1641;You lie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1642;[From.GetBestName] did not take me inqiring about the content of [From.GetHerHis] lessons well, and declared that I was a most ungrateful student that [From.GetSheHe] is unwilling to try to teach anything further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1642;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1643;It seems [From.GetBestName] saw through my lies about the lessons I have been giving [From.GetHerHim], as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] considers me a liar and no longer wishes to receive any lessons from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1643;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1644;I have been receiving spiritual guidance from [From.GetBestName] for a while now, but I am starting to have second thoughts about the matter. I can see some value in the lessons I am being given at times, but at other times I feel it would be a mistake to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1644;I want to keep at it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1644;It is time to end this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1645;It seems [From.GetBestName] has grown tired of the spiritual guidance I have been providing as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it best for the lessons to end as they simply do not appeal to [From.GetHerHim] any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1645;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1646;The spiritual guidance I have been receiving from [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. I now see what [From.GetSheHe] has been trying to teach me all along, and looking back it is hard to believe I could ever have wanted to live a different way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1646;Zeal is foolish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1647;The spiritual guidance I have been proving [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. [From.GetSheHeCap] has without a doubt become a cynical person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1647;Just as I intended!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1649;The spiritual guidance I am giving to [From.GetBestName] does not seem to be having much of an effect. Though I suppose that not everyone might change their ways quickly, I sometimes wonder whether it is pointless to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1649;I should keep at it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1649;This is pointless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1650;Today [From.GetBestName] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it would be best for [From.GetHerHim] to stop giving me spiritual guidance even though I have not changed my ways as much as initially planned. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] thinks we are just wasting our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1650;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1652;After spending some time getting to know me better [From.GetBestName] has finally decided what kind of spiritual guidance [From.GetSheHe] can give me, and [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that the lessons will be on the topic of honesty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1652;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1654;As [From.GetBestName] continues to give me spiritual guidance related to honesty I find myself wondering if I actually am going to find the lessons useful at any point. I am already rather honest, and maybe this is a waste of my time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1654;These lessons might actually be good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_1654;I think we are done here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1655;I have been having some difficulty teaching [From.GetBestName] that honesty is not a good thing, but at long last I can see some signs of progress. It will probably still be a while before [From.GetSheHe] has reached the point where it is prudent to end the lessons, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1655;I knew I could do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1656;Though I have been doing my best to teach [From.GetBestName] that honesty is not a good thing, [From.GetSheHe] is not really making any progress. Since [From.GetSheHe] is known for [From.GetHerHis] honesty, this is hardly surprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1656;I suppose I need to work harder...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1657;Today [From.GetBestName] approached me to inform me that [From.GetSheHe] no longer is interested in receiving spiritual guidance from me, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] thinks [From.GetSheHe] knows quite a bit about the topic already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1657;If that's what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1658;[From.GetBestName] has been giving me spiritual guidance related to honesty for a while, and [From.GetSheHe] has pointed out that there are times when being honest might put me at risk. I know the Hwarang want me to trust people, but maybe I am taking it too far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1658;I should not trust quite as much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1659;[From.GetBestName] was rather trusting when I started giving [From.GetHerHim] spiritual guidance, which certainly has been helpful, but this seems to have changed. At the moment, I doubt [From.GetSheHe] suspects I have ulterior motives, but maybe that will change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1659;This could be a problem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1660;Though I doubt [From.GetBestName] has realized that I am not actually giving [From.GetHerHim] spiritual guidance meant to make [From.GetHerHim] more honest [From.GetHerHis] growing paranoia makes me think it only is a matter of time before [From.GetSheHe] starts suspecting I am up to no good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1660;I don't like this at all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1661;[From.GetBestName] keeps giving me lessons that supposedly are about honesty, but the more I hear from [From.GetHerHim] the more convinced I become that [From.GetSheHe] actually is trying to make me find honesty less appealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SOH_1662;I mean well, I assure you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_1670;The spiritual guidance I have been proving [From.GetBestName] has really paid off. [From.GetSheHeCap] has without a doubt become a very deceitful person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1670;Just as I intended!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1672;The spiritual guidance I am giving to [From.GetBestName] does not seem to be having much of an effect. Though I suppose that not everyone might change their ways quickly, I sometimes wonder whether it is pointless to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_1675;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1677;As [From.GetBestName] keeps giving me spiritual guidance about trust [From.GetSheHe] often mentions how there are times when people will take advantage of blind trust, and I find myself wondering if this has been the case when it comes to my belief in the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1677;Is my faith wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1678;[From.GetBestName] has been quite the zealot in the past, which I know has caused some issues with others that are not as zealous, but it seems this has changed as of late. It is possible my spiritual guidance has resulted in this, even if I cannot say for sure if that is the case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1678;That's not all bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1679;The more time I spend with [From.GetBestName], the more [From.GetSheHe] strikes me as a rather cynical person. This was not the case in the past, and I think it possible that my attempt to make [From.GetHerHim] less trusting is behind this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1679;This might help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1680;As I keep getting spiritual guidance related to trust from [From.GetBestName] I realize more and more that some of my friends might not be true friends after all. [friend_to_remove.GetBestName] in particular strikes me as rather less trustworthy these days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1680;We can't be friends any longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1681;[From.GetBestName] and [friend_to_remove.GetBestName] used to be close friends, but they have clearly drifted apart as of late. I suspect that the spiritual guidance I have been giving [From.GetBestName] is what has caused the end of their friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1681;I think I'm making some progress...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1682;I have considered [From.GetBestName] a good friend for quite some time, but today it became clear that this is not mutual as [From.GetSheHe] told me that [From.GetSheHe] no longer wishes to associate with me. I am not sure what might have caused this, but I do not think it is something I have done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1682;I can't change [From.GetHerHis] mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1683;I have been receiving spiritual guidance from [From.GetBestName] for a while now, but I am starting to have second thoughts about the matter. I can see some value in the lessons I am being given at times, but at other times I feel it would be a mistake to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_1810;I have spent several days meditating on how to better myself, questioning why I have struggled with being chaste in the past.

EVTDESC_SOH_1811;I have spent several days meditating on how to better myself, and though I do not feel I have made any significant progress I feel that it has been a worthwhile experience, and possibly something that might help me in the right direction in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_1814;I have spent several days meditating on how to better myself, but as I kept meditating I started questioning why I am trying to change myself and whether I am simply trying to please others at the expense of being true to myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_1816;[From.GetBestName], a friend and a fellow member of the Hwarang, has asked me for some tips on how to be more chaste, as [From.GetSheHe] wishes to improve in that regard to be a better person and a better member of the Hwarang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1816;I will give [From.GetHerHim] some useful tips;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1817;[From.GetBestName] gave me quite a few tips regarding how I could think to be more chaste, and it did not take me long to figure out how they were applicable for me in particular. I have definitely made some noticeable progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_1818;I got quite a few tips from [From.GetBestName], but so far I have not managed to figure out just how they might be applicable for me. Maybe some of them will not be useful in the end, but others could certainly be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_1896;[From.GetBestName], a friend and a fellow member of the Hwarang, has asked me for some tips on how to be more patient, as [From.GetSheHe] wishes to improve in that regard to be a better person and a better member of the Hwarang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_1896;I will give [From.GetHerHim] some useful tips;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_1897;[From.GetBestName] gave me quite a few tips regarding how I could think to be more patient, and it did not take me long to figure out how they were applicable for me in particular. I have definitely made some noticeable progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_2069;I am trying to become zealous to be a better member of the Hwarang, and though it might take me several tries to improve in that regard I need to figure out how I want to approach the matter for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2069;I will meditate on the matter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2069;I will speak to [hwarang_self_reflection_help.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2069;I will request help from the Hwarang!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_2069;I will visit a temple for assistance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2070;I have spent several days meditating on how to better myself, questioning why I have struggled with being zealous in the past. Initially I did not expect much, but as I kept meditating I discovered things about myself I did not know before, and I have definitely made significant progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2070;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2071;I have spent several days meditating on how to better myself, and though I do not feel I have made any significant progress I feel that it has been a worthwhile experience, and possibly something that might help me in the right direction in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2071;That wasn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2072;I have spent several days meditating on how to better myself, and though I do not feel I have made any significant progress I feel that it has been a worthwhile experience, and possibly something that might help me in the right direction in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2072;That wasn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2073;I have spent several days meditating on how to better myself, but though it certainly could have been worse I also feel I have not made any progress whatsoever, and it is possible the whole thing was a waste of my time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2073;I expected more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2074;I have spent several days meditating on how to better myself, but as I kept meditating I started questioning why I am trying to change myself and whether I am simply trying to please others at the expense of being true to myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2074;Is this a mistake?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2075;I have spent several days meditating on how to better myself, but as I kept meditating I started questioning why I am trying to change myself and whether I am simply trying to please others at the expense of being true to myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2075;Is this a mistake?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2076;[From.GetBestName], a friend and a fellow member of the Hwarang, has asked me for some tips on how to be more zealous, as [From.GetSheHe] wishes to improve in that regard to be a better person and a better member of the Hwarang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2076;I will give [From.GetHerHim] some useful tips;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2077;[From.GetBestName] gave me quite a few tips regarding how I could think to be more zealous, and it did not take me long to figure out how they were applicable for me in particular. I have definitely made some noticeable progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2077;That was helpful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2078;I got quite a few tips from [From.GetBestName], but so far I have not managed to figure out zealous how they might be applicable for me. Maybe some of them will not be useful in the end, but others could certainly be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2078;It was certainly not bad advice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2079;I got quite a few tips from [From.GetBestName], but so far I have not managed to figure out zealous how they might be applicable for me. Maybe some of them will not be useful in the end, but others could certainly be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2079;It was certainly not bad advice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2080;One of the advantages of being a member of the Hwarang is that there are always someone around to ask for assistance, and as such it was not too much trouble for me to find someone that could help me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2080;Together, we can achieve anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2081;I visited a temple as planned to seek assitance from the people there, and I got some advice that certainly will help me be more zealous. Moreover, I felt as if the people at the temple really appreciated my visit and my attempt to better myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2081;Time well spent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2082;I visited a temple as planned for some help with my self-reflection. I felt very welcome there, and though the visit did not really result in any progress it did not feel as if it was a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_2083;I got a few good tips, at least...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2084;My visit to a temple for help with my self-reflection was very uneventful. None of those there had any useful tips to give me, and though I did not feel unwelcome I feel as if it was not time well spent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2084;That didn't help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2085;I felt most unwelcome when I visited a temple for some help with my self-reflection. None of those there could offer me any useful tips, and some of them even seemed to be displeased to see me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2085;I expected so much more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2087;I have been attempting to become more zealous for a while now, but I have not succeeded in reaching my goal yet. It is possible I am wasting my time, but also possible I can succeed if I keep on trying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2087;I will keep trying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2087;This is going nowhere...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Other powers
EVTDESC_SOH_2101;It is possible for me to leave the Hwarang if I feel that I am too old to remain part of the society, but anyone that stops being a member of the society will never be allowed to re-join. If I leave now, I would get [hwarang_cash_out.GetValue] prestige and piety due my current Devotion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2101;It is time for me to leave the Hwarang!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2101;Actually, I think I'll remain a member...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2102;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] has decided to leave the Hwarang, citing [From.GetHerHis] age as [From.GetHerHis] reason for doing so. This is certainly not unusual, as few remain part of the Hwarang until the day they die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2102;Good to know, regardless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2104;It is no secret that [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] is a member of the Hwarang and that the Hwarang put a great stock in loyalty, but I did not know just how highly they thought of [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] before a number of them approached me today, pointing out the many benefits of being a loyal subject of [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2104;Maybe we should try to be friends?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2104;Maybe it is time for our rivalry to end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2104;I should really be less ambitious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_2104;I don't really care about one of my claims...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_2104;I could be more chaste, like [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_2104;I could be more temperate, like [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_SOH_2104;I could be more charitable, like [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTH_SOH_2104;I could be more diligent, like [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTI_SOH_2104;I could be more patient, like [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTJ_SOH_2104;I could be more kind, like [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTK_SOH_2104;I could be more humble, like [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTL_SOH_2104;I could be more zealous, like [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTM_SOH_2104;I could be more just, like [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTN_SOH_2104;I guess I can make an effort...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2105;It seems my attempt to inspire loyalty from [From.GetBestName] has gone better than expected, as [From.GetSheHe] has written to me suggesting that we perhaps have a lot in common and should be friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2105;That's a great idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2105;I think not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2106;My attempt to befriend [From.GetBestName] was not in vain, as it seems [From.GetSheHe] also thinks we have a lot in common and wishes to spend more time with me. This surely will mean great things for both of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2106;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2107;It seems [From.GetBestName] does not want to be my friend at this time. Perhaps it is due to lingering doubts about my loyalty from before the Hwarang visited me, or perhaps there is something else to it that I am not aware of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2107;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2108;It seems my attempt to inspire loyalty from [From.GetBestName] has gone better than expected, as [From.GetSheHe] has written to me suggesting that perhaps it is time for the two of us to set aside our ongoing rivalry and work together, for the good of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2108;It is time for our rivalry to end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2108;I have neither forgotten nor forgiven!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2109;[From.GetBestName] was quite receptive to my idea to end our rivalry in the name of what's best for the realm. We are certainly not friends, but we should be able to get along quite a bit better now if both of us were sincere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2109;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2110;It seems [From.GetBestName] still has a strong dislike of me, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] has let me know that [From.GetSheHe] has no intention of ending our rivalry, stating that I do not deserve anything more than [From.GetHerHis] enmity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2110;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2111;It seems the Hwarang I sent to speak with [From.GetBestName] made an impression, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] seems to be rather less ambitious now. This will surely make [From.GetHerHim] much more loyal than [From.GetSheHe] previously was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2111;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2112;I have received word that [From.GetBestName] publicly has renounced [From.GetHerHis] claim on one of my titles. It seems the Hwarang I sent to [From.GetHerHim] to lecture [From.GetHerHim] about loyalty made quite the impression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2112;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2113;It seems [From.GetBestName] felt inspired by what the Hwarang I sent to speak to [From.GetHerHim] had to say about me, as [From.GetSheHe] seems to have made an effort to become more chaste due to me being more chaste than [From.GetSheHe] was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_2117;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2118;It seems [From.GetBestName] felt inspired by what the Hwarang I sent to speak to [From.GetHerHim] had to say about me, as [From.GetSheHe] seems to have made an effort to become more kind due to me being more kind than [From.GetSheHe] was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2118;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_2121;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2122;I had hoped that the Hwarang I sent to speak with [From.GetBestName] would convince [From.GetHerHim] to take some step to get along better with me, but it seems [From.GetSheHe] has not seen fit to do anything of the sort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2122;At least [From.GetSheHe] seems slightly more loyal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2124;There are quite a few lifestyles that would be deemed appropriate for a member of the Hwarang. The question is, which would be the most fitting for me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2124;I will spend more time with people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2124;I will dedicate myself to games!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2124;Perhaps something else;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SOH_2125;I will become a skilled hunter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_SOH_2127;Perhaps something else;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_2127;I need more time to think about this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2128;I have just received an emissary from [FromFrom.GetBestName], bringing a proposal that the two of us should enter into a non-aggression pact. Perhaps it would be beneficial for me as well as [FromFrom.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2128;An excellent idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2128;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2129;The emissary I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with good news. [From.GetBestName] has agreed to a non-aggression pact with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2129;Just as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2130;The emissary I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with bad news. [From.GetBestName] has not agreed to a non-aggression pact with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2130;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2131;[From.GetBestName] has put forward a demand that I should step aside as the leader of the Hwarang and instead let [From.GetHerHim] lead the society, claiming that I am getting too old to be an effective leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2131;I suppose that's a reasonable request...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2131;I can't refuse, but I will remember this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2131;Such an outrageous demand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_2131;Let you lead? Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2132;[From.GetBestName] has seen fit to agree to my request that [From.GetSheHe] should step aside and let me lead the Hwarang. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] is not entirely pleased with this, though at least [From.GetSheHe] stepped aside rather gracefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2132;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2133;Though my demand that [From.GetBestName] should step aside as the leader of the Hwarang was something that several other members found reasonable, it seems [From.GetBestName] still has sufficient support to remain in charge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2133;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# General flavor events
EVTDESC_SOH_2201;As a young member of the Hwarang I have often encountered older members that are eager to give me suggestions about what I could do better. These suggestions tend to be rather limited, however, so maybe I should approach someone like [hwarang_mentor.GetBestName] to see if I could get some more extensive guidance?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2201;I'll ask [hwarang_mentor.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2201;I don't want to bother [hwarang_mentor.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2202;Today I was approached by [From.GetBestName], a younger member of the Hwarang. It seems [From.GetSheHe] wishes to learn how to become a better member of the Hwarang and that [From.GetSheHe] thinks I am someone that could give [From.GetHerHim] some guidance in that regard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2202;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2202;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2203;[From.GetBestName] has agreed to give me some more extensive guidance to let me be a better member of the Hwarang in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2203;Just was I expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2204;[From.GetHerHim] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] does not have the time or the interest to help me become a better member of the Hwarang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2204;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2206;[From.GetBestName] has given me several useful lessons recently, focusing on teaching me how to better at fighting. I expect the Hwarang as a whole will approve of both my progress and [From.GetHerHis] help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_2295;My attempt to convince [From.GetBestName] to join the Hwarang was not in vain, as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] is willing to join the society at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2295;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2296;Despite doing my best to make [From.GetBestName] see the benefits of joining the Hwarang [From.GetSheHe] has told me that [From.GetSheHe] sees little reason to join the society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2296;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2297;Despite the Hwarang valuing cooperation and trust in its ranks there are those that are not worthy of either, such as [nammo.GetBestName]. I do not like her, and she does not like me, and perhaps it would be for the best if she no longer was among the living...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2297;I will try to meet and kill her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2297;It would be wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2298;My rival, [junjeong.GetBestName], has invited me to an informal meeting at a tea house, supposedly to discuss our differences. The Hwarang would approve of me attending, without a doubt, but I am not sure meeting with her is all that appealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SOH_2298;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_SOH_2298;It is an unnecessary risk...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2299;[nammo.GetBestName] has refused to meet with me, offering no reasonable excuse. I am not sure if she suspected a trap or not, but it is clear I will have to figure out some other way to get her out of the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_2300;[nammo.GetBestName] has agreed to meet me at a tea house. It is possible she suspects a trap, but at least I will have an opportunity to get her out of the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2300;Brave, but foolish...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2302;I have arrived at the tea house where I am to meet with [nammo.GetBestName] and it is time for me to decide how to approach the matter of her death or whether I should abandon the whole idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2302;I will arrange for her tea to be poisoned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2302;I will try to cut her down once we are seated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_2303;I arrived at the tea house shortly after [junjeong.GetBestName] and greeted her as courteously as I could given my dislike for her. It did not take long for our tea to arrive, and it was well worth the wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2303;This is some good tea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2304;[nammo.GetBestName] arrived shortly afer me and we exchanged greetings as courteously as we could. It did not take long for the tea to arrive, and [nammo.GetBestName] drank hers quite eagerly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_2305;I found myself wondering whether [nammo.GetBestName] would notice that something was wrong before we were finished at the tea house, but she clearly did not, and I made sure to have an excuse ready to leave rather quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2305;It won't be long now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2306;[junjeong.GetBestName] had to leave our meeting rather abruptly, which certainly was to my liking. Shortly after she left I started feeling unwell, and before long all of my strength was slipping away...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2306;Poison...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2307;It did not take long for the agent I left behind at the tea house to catch up to me with word that [nammo.GetBestName] died from the poison in her tea and that the local authorities seem to think that she died of natural causes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2307;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2308;I arrived at the tea house shortly after [junjeong.GetBestName] and after receiving word from my agents that [junjeong.GetBestName] had arranged to have my tea poisoned. When the tea is served, I will need to have a plan for how to handle it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2308;I will try to make her drink it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hwarang_junjeong_nammo_swap;I will swap our tea cups, hopefully poisoning my rival, [junjeong.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2308;I will knock it over...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hwarang_junjeong_nammo_spill;I will spill my tea, ensuring that nobody drinks the poison;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2309;[nammo.GetBestName] arrived shortly afer me and we exchanged greetings as courteously as we could. It did not take long for the tea to arrive, and [nammo.GetBestName] drank hers quite eagerly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2309;Everything is going as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2310;[junjeong.GetBestName] did not notice the swap, and though it was a bit difficult to do so I managed to keep myself from smiling as she made an excuse to leave early, knowing that things were not going as she had expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2310;She's already dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2311;I made sure to have an excuse ready to leave rather quickly and thus departed well before [nammo.GetBestName] was finished at the tea house. However, not long after I left I found my strength slipping away, and realized that things had not gone as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2311;She... tricked me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2312;I had my agent follow [junjeong.GetBestName] as she left the tea house and it did not take long before I heard that she had collapsed on the road and that none of her servants had managed to save her life. Even better, nobody suspects foul play.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2312;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2313;[nammo.GetBestName] apparently suspects poison, seeing as she swaps our cups in a manner that is not quite as stealthily as she thinks it is. I should certainly not drink my tea, but the question is what I should do now that my plan has been foiled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2313;I will spill it and try to make this end peacefully...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2313;It is time for a more direct approach!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hwarang_junjeong_nammo_attack;I will attack my rival, abandoning all subtlety;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2314;[junjeong.GetBestName] spills her tea before drinking any of it and arranges to have a new cup delivered at once. It is unclear if she noticed the swap or if she was just a bit clumsy, but it is clear that we are both going to be leaving alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2314;Well, that ends that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2315;Matters at the tea house did not go as expected. Both I and [nammo.GetBestName] survived, and she likely knows I am trying to kill her now. Worse, she might be trying to kill me too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2315;I need to watch my back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2316;Both I and [junjeong.GetBestName] survived our meeting, but it is clear that she is trying to kill me, and she might suspect that I am trying to kill her even if I only attempted to turn matters around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2316;I need to watch my back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2317;Before either of us can start drinking our tea [junjeong.GetBestName] pulls free a dagger and lunges at me, letting out a loud battle cry. It is clear one of us will not be alive much longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2317;I will kill you before you kill me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2318;I attack [nammo.GetBestName] with my dagger and she pulls out one of her own. It is unclear if she expected such an attack or not, but before long she gains the upper hand and I find myself on the floor, bleeding out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2318;No! No! No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2319;I pull out a dagger of my own and defend myself against [junjeong.GetBestName]'s attack. It is unclear whether she expected me to put up a fight or not, but before long I gain the upper hand and she finds herself on the floor, bleeding out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2319;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2320;I attack [nammo.GetBestName] with my dagger and she pulls out one of her own. It is unclear if she expected such an attack or not, but before long I gain the upper hand and she finds herself on the floor, bleeding out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2320;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2321;I pull out a dagger of my own and defend myself against [junjeong.GetBestName]'s attack. It is unclear whether she expected me to put up a fight or not, but before long she gains the upper hand and I finds myself on the floor, bleeding out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2321;No! No! No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2322;I do not know if [nammo.GetBestName] suspected that her tea was poisoned or if she was just clumsy, but she managed to spill her tea before drinking any of it. It is clear my plan has failed, and safest to take no further action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2322;Well, that ends that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2323;It is hard to tell if [nammo.GetBestName] is more suspicious towards me than usual when it is time to leave the tea house, but regardless of whether that is the case both of us will be leaving alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2323;That did not go as expected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2324;I do not know if [junjeong.GetBestName] suspects that I intentionally spilled my tea or not, but it is clear that she cannot be trusted at all since she clearly dislikes me enough to try to kill me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2324;I need to watch my back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2325;Before either of us can start drinking our tea [junjeong.GetBestName] pulls free a dagger and lunges at me, letting out a loud battle cry. It is clear one of us will not be alive much longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2325;I will kill you before you kill me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2326;I attack [nammo.GetBestName] with my dagger and she pulls out one of her own. It is unclear if she expected such an attack or not, but before long she gains the upper hand and I find myself on the floor, bleeding out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2326;No! No! No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2327;I pull out a dagger of my own and defend myself against [junjeong.GetBestName]'s attack. It is unclear whether she expected me to put up a fight or not, but before long I gain the upper hand and she finds herself on the floor, bleeding out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2327;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2328;I attack [nammo.GetBestName] with my dagger and she pulls out one of her own. It is unclear if she expected such an attack or not, but before long I gain the upper hand and she finds herself on the floor, bleeding out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2328;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2329;I pull out a dagger of my own and defend myself against [junjeong.GetBestName]'s attack. It is unclear whether she expected me to put up a fight or not, but before long she gains the upper hand and I finds myself on the floor, bleeding out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2329;No! No! No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2330;[junjeong.GetBestName] and I converse for a while while drinking our tea. We manage to avoid various topics that would make it hard for us to have a civil conversation, even if things certainly are a bit strained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2330;At least the tea was nice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2331;[nammo.GetBestName] and I leave the tea house without anything of note happening. I expect that the other Hwarang will approve of the meeting we had, since it was reasonably friendly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SOH_2331;Well, it could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2332;[junjeong.GetBestName] and I leave the tea house without anything of note happening. I expect that the other Hwarang will approve of the meeting we had, since it was reasonably friendly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SOH_2332;Well, it could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2333;[junjeong.GetBestName] surprises me when I arrive at the tea house by greeting me in a rather friendly manner. Shortly after the tea arrives, she surprises me even more by suggesting that maybe it is time for us to put our rivalry aside, seeing as the Hwarang as a whole disapprove of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2333;I suppose that's agreeable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2333;What an outrageous suggestion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2334;[nammo.GetBestName] is quite receptive to my suggestion that we should end our rivalry, and though we certainly do not become friends during our meeting we manage to find some common ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2334;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2335;It feels rather strange to leave the tea house on good terms with [nammo.GetBestName], but the Hwarang as a whole will approve of us being on friendlier terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2335;This will surely be good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2336;It feels rather strange to leave the tea house on good terms with [junjeong.GetBestName], but the Hwarang as a whole will approve of us being on friendlier terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2336;This will surely be good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2337;[nammo.GetBestName] makes it abundantly clear that she has no interest in ending our rivalry almost before I can finish the suggestion. The rest of our conversation is rather strained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2337;I don't know what I expected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2338;The Hwarang as a whole will likely approve of my attempt to end my rivalry with [nammo.GetBestName] even though it did not work out, but it is rather clear that [nammo.GetBestName] is someone I need to be wary of as she clearly does not like me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2338;This could have gone better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2339;It is very likely that the Hwarang will not approve of my refusal to end my rivalry with [junjeong.GetBestName], but I do not trust her, and I should be wary of her even though she claims to want to reconcile with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2339;She cannot be trusted...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2340;A young man by the name of [new_hwarang.GetBestName] has approached me with an offer to enter my service in exchange for me helping him become a member of the Hwarang despite the fact that he hardly is from an influential family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2340;I will put in a good word for you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2340;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2341;With many members of the Hwarang having an interest in Buddhism it is not unusual for monks and nuns to work closely with certain Hwarang, and one such individual has approached me and offered to work for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2341;I could use a [new_buddhist.GetManWoman] like you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2341;I don't need you or your help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2342;With many members of the Hwarang having an interest in Buddhism it is not unusual for monks and nuns to work closely with certain Hwarang, and one such individual has approached me and offered to work for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2342;I could use a [new_buddhist.GetManWoman] like you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2342;I don't need you or your help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2343;One of the guiding principles of the Hwarang is to show loyalty towards one's liege, and as a member of the Hwarang I am naturally expected to show such loyalty. Perhaps it would be a good idea to visit my liege's court to show my loyalty in person?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2343;I will visit [hwarang_liege.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2343;I have better things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2344;A member of the Hwarang, [From.GetBestName], has arrived at my court, supposedly intending to show [From.GetHerHis] loyalty in accordance with the guiding principles of the Hwarang. Should I welcome this unexpected guest?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2344;I'll welcome [From.GetHerHim], of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2344;I have no time for [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2345;It seems [From.GetBestName] does not value my loyalty as much as I expected as [From.GetSheHe] sent a servant to inform me that [From.GetSheHe] did not have time to deal with an unexpected guest and that [From.GetSheHe] thought it best if I returned some other time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2345;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2346;[From.GetBestName] welcomed me personally when I arrived and seemed quite pleased to see me even though I had not let [From.GetHerHim] know I was coming. Now I need to decide what I can do to show my appreciation and loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2346;I'll just try to hold a friendly conversation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2346;I'll offer to help [From.GetHerHim] become more virtuous;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2346;I'll freely give up a claim;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2347;Wanting to be a good host, I did my best to spend as much time as I could with [From.GetBestName] after [From.GetHerHis] unexpected arrival, conversing on a number of topics with [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetBestName] was quite eloquent, and it is clear that [From.GetSheHe] appreciates me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2347;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2348;My conversation with [From.GetBestName] went quite well, and I managed to make [From.GetHerHim] understand how much I appreciate [From.GetHerHim]. I expect that [From.GetSheHe] appreciates me more now as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2348;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2349;I did my best to be a good host and to spend time with [From.GetBestName], conversing on a number of topics. Sadly, it seems [From.GetBestName] either is very poor at choosing [From.GetHerHis] words or does not appreciate me as much as I thought, as some of the things [From.GetSheHe] said sounded quite insulting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2349;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2350;I did my best to tell [From.GetBestName] how much I appreciated [From.GetHerHim] and everything [From.GetSheHe] has done for the realm, but it seems I misspoke as [From.GetSheHe] seemed quite insulted by my words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2350;That did not go as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2351;[From.GetBestName] did not waste much time before telling me that [From.GetSheHe] feels [From.GetSheHe] could help me learn how to be a bit more virtuous, if that is something I would be interested in. Being a member of the Hwarang, [From.GetSheHe] probably knows what [From.GetSheHe] is talking about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2351;I accept this offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2351;I don't need [From.GetHerHis] help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2352;[From.GetBestName] was quite pleased with my offer to teach [From.GetHerHim] how to be a bit more virtuous, and being a member of the Hwarang I had little difficulty figuring out what woudl be reasoanble advice to give [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2352;I think that went well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2353;[From.GetBestName] turned down my offer to teach [From.GetHerHim] how to be a bit more virtuous. I do not know if [From.GetSheHe] was insulted by the offer or not, but it is clear that [From.GetSheHe] is happy to remain as [From.GetSheHe] is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2353;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2354;[From.GetBestName] really seems to be quite sincere in [From.GetHerHis] desire to show that [From.GetSheHe] is a loyal subject of mine, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] did not waste much time before informing me that [From.GetSheHe] was willing to publicly renounce [From.GetHerHis] claim on one of my titles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2354;That is indeed a sign of loyalty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2356;My visit to [hwarang_liege.GetBestName]'s court is nearing its end, and it seems to have gone rather well. It is possible I and [hwarang_liege.GetBestName] could become close friends, but perhaps that is not entirely appealing to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2356;I will suggest becoming friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2356;I have enough friends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2357;As [From.GetBestName] is about to depart [From.GetSheHe] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] has had a great time at my court and that [From.GetSheHe] wonders if it is the start of a true friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2357;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2357;I have enough friends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2358;[From.GetBestName] had apparently also had a good time, as [From.GetSheHe] was quite eager to accept my suggestion that we should become friends. I expect that we will find reason to meet agian in the future, and hopefully we will have a good time doing so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2358;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2359;It seems [From.GetBestName] has not found my visit as pleasant as I have found it, as [From.GetSheHe] turned down my offer to become friends, claiming that we really do not know one another well enough for that to be a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2359;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2360;It is time for me to return home from [hwarang_liege.GetBestName]'s court after a pleasant visit. Without doubt, the Hwarang as a whole will approve of the visit, as I clearly have showed my loyalty to my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2360;That was quite fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2361;[From.GetBestName] has finally departed from my court after a visit that was rather pleasant. I think [From.GetSheHe] really showed that [From.GetSheHe] is someone that tries [From.GetHerHis] best to follow the guiding principles of the Hwarang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2361;That was quite fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2362;It is finally time for me to leave [hwarang_liege.GetBestName]'s court and return home. The visit has not gone well, and though the Hwarang as a whole might be pleased by me making an attempt to show my loyalty it has not been enjoyable to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2362;At least it is over now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2363;[From.GetBestName] has finally departed after a visit to my court that certainly was unpleasant for both of us. The Hwarang as whole might approve of [From.GetHerHim] showing up to show [From.GetHerHis] loyalty, but I would have preferred if [From.GetSheHe] had not bothered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2363;Finally [From.GetSheHe] is gone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2364;One of the guiding principles of the Hwarang is to show that you trust other meembers, and as a member of the Hwarang I am naturally expected to show such trust. Perhaps it would be a good idea to visit [hwarang_host.GetBestName]'s court to show my trust?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2364;I will visit [hwarang_host.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2364;I have better things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2365;A fellow member of the Hwarang, [From.GetBestName], has arrived at my court, supposedly intending to show [From.GetHerHis] trust in accordance with the guiding principles of the Hwarang. Should I welcome this unexpected guest?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2365;I'll welcome [From.GetHerHim], of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2365;I have no time for [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_2379;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2380;It seems [From.GetBestName] has not found my visit as pleasant as I have found it, as [From.GetSheHe] turned down my offer to become friends, claiming that we really do not know one another well enough for that to be a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2380;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2381;It is time for me to return home from [hwarang_host.GetBestName]'s court after a pleasant visit. Without doubt, the Hwarang as a whole will approve of the visit, as I clearly have showed my trust in [hwarang_host.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2381;That was quite fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2382;[From.GetBestName] has finally departed from my court after a visit that was rather pleasant. I think [From.GetSheHe] really showed that [From.GetSheHe] is someone that tries [From.GetHerHis] best to follow the guiding principles of the Hwarang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2382;That was quite fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2383;It is finally time for me to leave [hwarang_host.GetBestName]'s court and return home. The visit has not gone well, and though the Hwarang as a whole might be pleased by me making an attempt to show my trust it has not been enjoyable to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2383;At least it is over now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2384;[From.GetBestName] has finally departed after a visit to my court that certainly was unpleasant for both of us. The Hwarang as whole might approve of [From.GetHerHim] showing up to show [From.GetHerHis] trust, but I would have preferred if [From.GetSheHe] had not bothered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2384;Finally [From.GetSheHe] is gone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2385;The Hwarang consider it important to remain on good terms with your family, and it is no secret that I and [hwarang_rival.GetBestName] are not on good terms. Perhaps I should try to reconcile with [hwarang_rival.GetHerHim], as the Hwarang as a whole would approve of it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2385;I will attempt to end our rivalry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2385;[hwarang_rival.GetSheHeCap] will always be my rival!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2386;[From.GetBestName] has reached out to me, suggesting that it perhaps is time for us to end our rivalry. I suspect [From.GetSheHe] is doing it because [From.GetSheHe] is a member of the Hwarang and the Hwarang as a whole disapprove of our rivalry, but perhaps it is still worth reconciling?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2386;It is time for our rivalry to end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2386;I will never stop being [From.GetHerHis] rival!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2387;[From.GetBestName] was receptive to my suggestion that it is time for our rivalry to end, and [From.GetSheHe] and I have managed to reach a point where we can hold a civil conversation even if we certainly are not friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2387;This is for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2388;[From.GetBestName] was unwilling to consider ending our rivalry, which I suppose should have been no surprise. The Hwarang as a whole will not like this outcome, but it is likely they will not hold it against me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2388;At least I tried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2389;The Hwarang as a whole tend to pay a lot of attention to their appearance, and I have done the same as a member, and this sometimes has its benefits. Today, a [hwarang_lover.GetManWoman] named [hwarang_lover.GetBestName] approached me and told me that [hwarang_lover.GetSheHe] would not mind getting to know me quite intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2389;I'll make [hwarang_lover.GetHerHim] my lover!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2389;I suppose we can have a quick tumble...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2389;It would be wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2390;It is no secret that I am not particularly good at intrigue despite having an education related to it, and the Hwarang do not approve of it in the first place. Since there are many members of the Hwarang that have some knowledge related to other fields, maybe I should take advantage of this to learn the basics in another field?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2390;I will choose another path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2390;I am happy the way I am!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2391;Having decided that I want to focus on something else, I need to figure out just what it should be. The Hwarang approve of all fields other than intrigue, so I have several choices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2391;I will focus on diplomacy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2391;I will focus on warfare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2391;I will focus on rulership!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_2391;I will focus on religion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2392;I did hardly do well in the field I studied as a child, and maybe it is wrong for me. The Hwarang have many members that know enough about other approved fields to teach me the basics should I decide I want to focus on something else instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2392;I would rather focus on diplomacy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2392;I would rather focus on warfare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2392;I would rather focus on rulership!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_2392;I would rather focus on religion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_2392;I will not change myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2393;Some other members of the Hwarang have invited me to participate in a discussion of matters related to diplomacy in the hopes that we all may learn something from one another. I am free to turn down the offer, of course, but perhaps it would be in my interest to participate?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2393;I will participate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2393;I have better things to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2394;I did quite well during the discussion with the other members of the Hwarang, and while I did not learn anything in particular several of the others praised my knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2394;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2395;I did quite well during the discussion with the other members of the Hwarang, and while I did not learn anything in particular several of the others praised my knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2395;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2396;I learned a lot discussing diplomatic matters some other members of the Hwarang, and I feel I really have a much better understanding of the subject now than I had previously.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2396;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2397;The discussion I had with the other members of the Hwarang could certainly have gone better, but unlike some of those present I did not make a fool out of myself by showing that I was completely ignorant of the subject we were discussing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2397;I suppose that went okay...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2398;I did very poorly during the discussing with the other members of the Hwarang, and I also did not learn anything of note. It is clear that several of those present respect me and my opinion a lot less now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2398;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2399;I did very poorly during the discussing with the other members of the Hwarang, and I also did not learn anything of note. It is clear that several of those present respect me and my opinion a lot less now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_2420;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2421;Some other members of the Hwarang have offered me the opportunity to spar with them. It is possible this will help me become a better warrior, though of course there is also a risk of injury if things go poorly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2421;I'll participate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2421;I have better things to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2422;The sparring session went very well, and I learned several useful things from the others that were present. I expect I will do better as a warrior in the future as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2422;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2423;Though I did not learn anything noteworthy during the sparring session the other members of the Hwarang that were present spoke highly of my skills and told me they appreciated my presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_2425;I suppose it could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2426;Things did not go well during the sparring session with the other Hwarang as I made a mistake that resulted in me being injured by my sparring partner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2426;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2427;Though I managed to avoid injuring myself while sparring with some other members of the Hwarang I did not impress anyone with my skills, and some of those present even seemed quite disappointed by my performance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
