EVTDESC_SOH_9801;Before I can invite my vassals to my Bear Festival I need to ensure that all the necessary preparations have been taken care of. It should not take overly long to get them out of the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9801;Let's get started!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9802;When sending off a spirit it is traditional to dress it up in a ceremonial costume. Of course, the specifics as to how nice the costume should be are somewhat vague...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9802;The spirit deserves an excellet costume!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9802;I will give it an acceptable costume!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9802;The spirit doesn't care about its costume!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9803;In addition to dressing up the bear in a ceremonial costume, it needs to be fed during the ceremony. How much food should it be given?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9803;The bear shall have plenty of food!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9803;I think a moderate food is reasonable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9803;I will give it the bare minimum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9804;The guests coming to my Bear Festival will of course expect me to provide food prior to the sacrifice. I need to decide how much I am prepared to spend on this prior to sending out the invitations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9805;With the preparations taken care of, I can finally send out the invitations to my vassals. I hope that all of them will be able to come to my Bear Festival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9806;[Root.GetTitledName]\nI hereby invite you to my Bear Festival and hope that you will be able to attend. It is time for us send off a spirit properly!\nBest regards,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9806;I'll be there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9806;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9807;[Root.GetTitledName],\nI have made other plans and will not be attending your Bear Festival.\nBest regards,\n[From.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9808;The guests are finally arriving at my Bear Festival, and the bear that I have been raising has been appropriately tied up for the sacrifice. The celebration can finally begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9808;Welcome! Welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9809;I have finally arrived at [From.GetBestName]'s Bear Festival, as have many other guests from other parts of [From.GetHerHis] realm. As best I can tell, everything is ready for the celebration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9809;I hope it will be fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9811;[From.GetBestName] really seems to have gone out of [From.GetHerHis] way to ensure that there is plentiful and varied food at [From.GetHerHis] Bear Festival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9811;This pleases me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9811;An unnecessary expense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9811;I suppose it is nice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9812;The food provided at [From.GetBestName]'s Bear Festival is neither the most varied nor the most plentiful I have experienced, but it is clear [From.GetSheHe] has put some effort into the preparations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9812;[From.GetSheHeCap] has made a wise decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9812;[From.GetSheHeCap] spent too much on the food!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9812;I suppose it is a reasonable amount...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9813;Though [From.GetBestName] has made sure that there is food available for the guests at [From.GetHerHis] Bear Festival, it is neither plentiful nor particularly varied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9813;It shows good judgement!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9813;[From.GetSheHeCap] should have done more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9813;I suppose it still could be worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9814;[From.GetBestName] seems to have found my decision regarding the food to be served at the Bear Festival to have been a good one, as [From.GetSheHe] has made it clear that [From.GetSheHe] thinks my preparations were excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9814;That's good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9815;It seems [From.GetBestName] does not approve of the amount or quality of the food served at the Bear Festival, as [From.GetSheHe] has been heard complaining about it rather loudly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9815;[From.GetSheHeCap] should shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9816;As the Bear Festival goes on I find myself spending some time with [bear_festival_friend.GetBestName], a rather fascinating [bear_festival_friend.GetManWoman], and I find that we have a lot in common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9816;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9817;I have the opportunity to spend some time getting to know [From.GetBestName] at [From.GetHerHis] Bear Festival, and I really feel that we have a lot in common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9817;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9818;I find myself spending spending quite some time with [bear_festival_friend_character_2.GetBestName] at [From.GetBestName]'s Bear Festival, and we turn out to have quite a few things in common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9818;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9819;I and [bear_festival_friend_character_1.GetBestName] have an opportunity to spend some time together at [From.GetBestName]'s Bear Festival, and it turns out we have a lot in common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9819;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9820;It seems [bear_festival_friend_character_1.GetBestName] and [bear_festival_friend_character_2.GetBestName] have grown quite a bit closer during the Bear Festival, seeing as they both have loudly proclaimed their friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9820;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9821;At [From.GetBestName]'s Bear Festival I have the displeasure of spending time with [bear_festival_rival_character_2.GetBestName], a thoroughly unpleasant [bear_festival_rival_character_2.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9821;I really hate them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9822;It seems [bear_festival_rival_character_1.GetBestName] is at [From.GetBestName]'s Bear Festival. [bear_festival_rival_character_1.GetSheHeCap] really is an unpleasant [bear_festival_rival_character_1.GetManWoman], and I really do not enjoy being in their presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9822;In fact, I hate them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9823;Two of my guests, [bear_festival_rival_character_1.GetBestName] and [bear_festival_rival_character_2.GetBestName], really do not seem to be enjoying each other's company, and all attempts to make them get along seem to have failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9823;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9824;As the Bear Festival continues one of my servants comes running, screaming that the bear has escaped. I cannot be blamed for this, seeing as I did not tie it up myself, but it is still a major embarrasment to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9824;This is a disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9825;I am having a good time conversing with some of the other guests at [From.GetBestName]'s Bear Festival when a servant comes running, screaming that the bear that was due to be sacrificed has escaped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9825;What an embarrasment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9826;I am conversing with some of the guests at the Bear Festival when I suddenly hear someone cry out in pain outside. Running out, I discover that [bear_festival_wounded_guest.GetBestName] has been wounded by the bear, which somehow has gotten loose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9826;Make sure it is tied up properly this time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9827;As I am walking around some distance away from the main celebration at [From.GetBestName]'s Bear Festival to get some fresh air I hear movement behind me. Turning around, I find the bear that's due to be sacrificed standing there, clearly not tied up. I manage to get away from it quickly enough, but not without being wounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9827;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9828;As the Bear Festival continues the celebration is briefly interrupted by the sound of screaming. I and several others head to investigate it, and it turns out the bear has gotten loose and has attacked [bear_festival_wounded_guest.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9828;I hope it is tied up properly this time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9829;One of my servants informs me that the bear at the Bear Festival apparently had not been tied up properly as it somehow got loose. Luckily, it did not wander off or hurt anyone, and it has been tied up properly now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9829;That could have been bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9830;One of [From.GetBestName]'s servants brings word that the bear at the Bear Festival had gotten loose, but that it has been tied up properly now. Nobody was hurt in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9830;That could have been bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9831;The bear that [From.GetBestName] has raised for [From.GetHerHis] Bear Festival is very large, and it looks as if it has been taken care of quite well indeed. It is clear that it has been raised in an appropriate fashion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9831;Most impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9832;It seems [From.GetBestName] really thinks that the bear at my Bear Festival is impressive. I have of course ensured that it was well taken care of, and it is good to know that that is appreciated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9832;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9833;The bear at [From.GetBestName]'s Bear Festival is rather unimpressive compared to others I have seen in the past. It is as if [From.GetBestName] has not been taking proper care of it, which is unlikely to please the spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9833;It is a rather disappointing sight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9834;It seems [From.GetBestName] does not think much of the bear at my Bear Festival as [From.GetSheHe] has been heard complaining about how small it is and how it does not look anything like those [From.GetSheHe] has seen before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9834;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9836;As [From.GetBestName] has the bear brought out to the banquet in its honor I can see that [From.GetSheHe] has spared no expense when it comes to arranging for the customary costume for the bear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9836;A good choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9836;A poor choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9836;No comment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9837;As [From.GetBestName] has the bear brought out to the banquet in its honor I can see that [From.GetSheHe] has opted to give the bear a costume that is about what one would expect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9837;A good choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9837;A poor choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9837;No comment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9838;As [From.GetBestName] has the bear brought out to the banquet in its honor I can see that [From.GetSheHe] has decided to give the bear a costume that is rather less impressive than expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9838;A good choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9838;A poor choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9838;No comment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9839;It seems [From.GetBestName] feels that the costume I had prepared for the bear was quite fitting, as [From.GetSheHe] has been heard expressing [From.GetHerHis] approval of my decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9839;I am glad to hear that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9840;It seems [From.GetBestName] feels that the costume I had prepared for the bear was quite unfitting, as [From.GetSheHe] has been heard expressing [From.GetHerHis] disapproval of my decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9840;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9841;The food that [From.GetBestName] has prepared for the bear is quite spectacular, and well beyond what I would have expected at a Bear Festival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9841;A good choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9841;A poor choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9841;No comment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9842;The food that [From.GetBestName] has prepared for the bear is about as good as what I would have expected at a Bear Festival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9842;A good choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9842;A poor choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9842;No comment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9843;The food that [From.GetBestName] has prepared for the bear is quite underwhelming, and well beneath what I would have expected at a Bear Festival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9843;A good choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9843;A poor choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9843;No comment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9844;It seems [From.GetBestName] feels that the food I had prepared for the bear was quite fitting, as [From.GetSheHe] has been heard expressing [From.GetHerHis] approval of my decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9844;I am glad to hear that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9845;It seems [From.GetBestName] feels that the food I had prepared for the bear was quite unfitting, as [From.GetSheHe] has been heard expressing [From.GetHerHis] disapproval of my decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9845;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9846;The bear at my Bear Festival has eaten the banquet prepared in its honor, and now it is time to send the spirit off to where it belongs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9846;Let the ceremony commence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9847;The bear at [From.GetBestName]'s Bear Festival has eaten the banquet prepared in its honor, and now it is time to send the spirit off to where it belongs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9847;Let us begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9848;The bear is dead, and the spirit has been set free. Now it is time for me and my guests to consume its flesh, as is tradition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9848;I will eat some of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9848;I'm not hungry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9848;As if I would share!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9849;As is tradition, [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to share the flesh of the bear that was sacrificed with [From.GetHerHis] guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9849;I will eat some of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9849;I'm not hungry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9849;I will have more than my fair share!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9850;Despite it being traditional to share the flesh of the bear that was sacrificed with all at the Bear Festival [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to keep all of it for [From.GetHerHim]self.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9850;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9851;The bear has been sacrificed, and its flesh has been consumed. The more I think about it, the more I feel that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9851;...the spirit was that of [dead_kin_target.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9851;...it was some kind of nature spirit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9851;...it was just a bear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9852;As the festival continues, [From.GetBestName] appears to be lost in thought for a while, before suddenly proclaiming that the bear contained the spirit of [dead_kin_target.GetBestName], [From.GetBestName]'s deceased kins[dead_kin_target.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9852;That's great to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9852;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9852;And you just... had us eat them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9853;After seemingly thinking about the matter for a while, [From.GetBestName] proclaims that the bear that was sacrificed contained some kind of nature spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9853;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9854;To the surprise of everyone at the Bear Festival, [From.GetBestName] suddenly proclaims that the bear that was sacrificed only was a regular bear, not a spirit made flesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9854;No, it was definitely a spirit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9854;You're right about that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9856;The Bear Festival has come to an end, with a spirit properly sent off. I need to get back to ruling my realm, and my vassals need to return home to manage their own lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9856;That was rather fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9857;[From.GetBestName]'s Bear Festival has come to an end, with a spirit properly sent off. It is time for me to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9857;Until next time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9858;The Bear Festival has come to an end, even though we did not properly send off a spirit. I need to get back to ruling my realm, and my vassals need to return home to manage their own lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9858;Maybe we can have a proper one in the future...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9859;[From.GetBestName]'s Bear Festival has come to an end, without a bear being properly sent off. It is time for me to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9859;Maybe the next one will be better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9860;A war has broken out, and I cannot afford to celebrate a Bear Festival at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9860;I'm sure my vassals will understand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9861;[Root.GetBestName]\nI regret to inform you that the Bear Festival has been cancelled due to the ongoing war.\nBest regards,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9861;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
