EVTDESC_SOH_3504;The Chrysanthemum Throne is finally mine, and so is all the power and authority that comes with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3504;I guess I have a regent. For now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3504;Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3505;I have finally become the [Root.GetTitle], and all the power and authority of the position now belongs to me. Unfortunately, this power and authority is not as vast as it could be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3505;I guess I have a regent. For now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3506;I have finally succeeded [FromFrom.GetBestName], and all the power and authority that belonged to [FromFrom.GetHerHim] now belongs to me. Unfortunately, this power and authority is not as vast as it could be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3506;I guess I have a regent. For now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_3513;It seems [From.GetBestName] has leveraged [From.GetHerHis] considerable influence at court to secure more power for [From.GetHerselfHimself] at my expense. Sadly, I am in no position to oppose this for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3513;[From.GetSheHeCap] forgets [From.GetHerHis] place...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3514;Even though there are many in [From.GetBestName]'s court that are well aware that it is in the interest of the realm for me to have rather considerable authority it seems [From.GetBestName] has still managed to leverage [From.GetHerHis] influence to somewhat reduce my authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3514;[From.GetSheHeCap] is perhaps not content as a puppet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_3521;[Root.GetBestName]\nIt is clear to me that it would be best for the realm if I personally held [target_title.GetName], and I have taken the necessary steps to ensure that this indeed is the case.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[meddling_character.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3521;I am in no position to oppose this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3522;[Root.GetBestName]\nIt is clear to me that the realm would be better served by [target_vassal.GetBestName] being my direct vassal, and I have taken the necessary steps to ensure that this indeed is the case.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[meddling_character.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3522;I am in no position to oppose this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3523;[Root.GetBestName]\nIt is clear to me that the realm is better served by you being my direct vassal, and I have taken the necessary steps to ensure that this is indeed the case.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[meddling_character.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3523;I suppose that's fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3523;I have a bad feeling about this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3524;[meddling_character.GetBestName] has come to the conclusion that some of my wealth would be better in [meddling_character.GetHerHis] hands. [meddling_character.GetSheHeCap] claims that [meddling_character.GetSheHe] will be spending it in a fashion that will benefit the realm, but I have my doubts that that is the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3524;[meddling_character.GetSheHeCap] is just a common thief!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3525;[meddling_character.GetBestName] came to see me today and wasted no time before informing me that [meddling_character.GetSheHe] thinks it would be best for the realm if I spent the next year far, far away from government affairs. [meddling_character.GetSheHeCap] also let me know that [meddling_character.GetSheHe] has seen fit to assign me a large number of guards to ensure everything goes as planned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3525;I... have no choice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3526;[Root.GetBestName]\nI have decided that it would be in the interest of the realm for you to marry [new_spouse.GetBestName]. I have taken the liberty of ensuring that the wedding can take place immediately.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[meddling_character.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3526;I guess I have a new wife...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3527;I have just received word that [meddling_character.GetBestName] has seen fit to release [prisoner_to_release.GetBestName] from prison, supposedly acting in my name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3527;[meddling_character.GetSheHeCap] didn't even ask me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3529;I have just received word that [meddling_character.GetBestName] has seen fit to execute one of my prisoners, [prisoner_to_execute.GetBestName], supposedly acting in my name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3529;[meddling_character.GetSheHeCap] didn't even ask me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3531;It seems [meddling_character.GetBestName] has decided that [voter_to_fire.GetBestName] being on my council is not to [meddling_character.GetHerHis] liking, as [meddling_character.GetSheHe] has let [voter_to_fire.GetBestName] know that [voter_to_fire.GetHerHis] presence no longer is desired.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3531;At least [voter_to_fire.GetBestName] does not blame me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3532;I have just been informed by [meddling_character.GetBestName] that I am not welcome at any more council meetings for the time being, supposedly because the realm would benefit more from someone else in my old position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3532;This wasn't [Root.Liege.GetBestName]'s idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_3533;[Root.GetBestName],\nIt is apparent to everyone that you currently are unfit to serve as the Permanent Regent, and everyone agrees that I should serve in your stead. I am sure you will see things my way, at least in time.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3533;I'll remember this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3534;[Root.GetBestName],\nI am pleased to inform you that our combined efforts have paid off. I am now the Permanent Regent for [Root.Liege.GetBestName], and my tenure will continue indefinitely, for the good of the realm.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3534;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3535;[Root.GetBestName],\nYour former Permanent Regent was obviously unfit to serve, so I have taken the liberty to take over the Permanent Regency. For the good of the realm, this state of things will of course continue indefinitely.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3535;I suppose this is no worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_3536;[Root.GetBestName],\nThe time has come to end the Permanent Regency. I ask that you step aside willingly, but you should know I am prepared to compel you by force of arms should it prove necessary.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3536;I suppose I should step aside...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3536;I won't back down without a fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3537;[Root.GetBestName],\nI agree that the time has come for the Permanent Regency to be ended, and I will step aside willingly to prove my loyalty to you.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3537;Assuming direct control!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3538;[Root.GetBestName],\nThe Permanent Regency is in the interest of the realm as a whole, and if you seek to end it by force of arms I have no choice but to fight back.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3538;Then prepare for war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
