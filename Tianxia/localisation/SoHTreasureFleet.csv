EVTTITLE_TREASURE_FLEET_1;A Treasure Fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_1;You have decided to begin the preparations to launch a Treasure Fleet, which will show various barbarians the might and splendor of the Middle Kingdom and prove once and for all that you alone possess the Mandate of Heaven and deserve the Dragon Throne.\n\nThe preparations will take some time, of course, as it is impossible to ready the necessary ships or their contents overnight, but the shipwrights of the Middle Kingdom are expected to be up to the task, and the people of your realm will hopefully be of assistance as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_1;It will be auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TREASURE_FLEET_2;A Treasure Fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_2;Your liege, [From.GetBestName], has declared [From.GetHerHis] intention to launch a Treasure Fleet to show various barbarians the might and splendor of the Middle Kingdom and to prove once and for all that [From.GetSheHe] alone possesses the Mandate of Heaven and deserves the Dragon Throne.\n\nThe preparations will take some time, of course, as it is impossible to ready trhe necessary ships overnight, ut the shipwrights of the Middle Kingdom are expected to be up to the task, and [From.GetBestName] has expressed [From.GetHerHis] certainty that everyone will do their part to assist with the preparations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_2;Perhaps I should join it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_2;This does not concern me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TREASURE_FLEET_3;A Treasure Fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_3;Your liege, [From.GetBestName], has declared [From.GetHerHis] intention to launch a Treasure Fleet to show the world the might and splendor of the Middle Kingdom and to prove once and for all that [From.GetSheHe] alone possesses the Mandate of Heaven and deserves the Dragon Throne.\n\nThe preparations will take some time, of course, as it is impossible to ready trhe necessary ships overnight, ut the shipwrights of the Middle Kingdom are expected to be up to the task, and [From.GetBestName] has expressed [From.GetHerHis] certainty that everyone will do their part to assist with the preparations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_3;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_3;This does not concern me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_7;Recent events have forced you to end the preparation of the Treasure Fleet and have also forced you to indefinitely postpone the voyage. Perhaps things will change before long, allowing you to once more begin the preparations, but it is hard to say with any certainty what the future holds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_7;Very well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_8;Word has reached you that the planned Treasure Fleet voyage will not happen as planned as recent events have rendered it unfeasible. It is possible that a Treasure Fleet will be launched in the future, of course, assuming circumstances change for the better, but when that might happen is uncertain at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_8;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_9;Word has reached you that the planned Treasure Fleet voyage will not happen as planned as recent events have rendered it unfeasible. It is possible that a Treasure Fleet will be launched in the future, of course, assuming circumstances change for the better, but when that might happen is uncertain at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_9;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_10;The preparations for the Treasure Fleet's departure continue, and they seem to be going fairly well at the moment. However, several of the officials responsible for overseeing the preparations have requested that more funds are made available, claiming that these funds would allow for significant improvements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_10;I will invest more money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_10;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_11;A minor official involved in the preparation of the Treasure Fleet has seen fit to draft a proclamation that would call for every household in the Middle Kingdom to provide either funds or manpower for the Treasure Fleet. It is up to you whether it actually is desirable to send out this proclamation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_11;Issue the proclamation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_11;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_12;As the work on the Treasure Fleet continues various bureaucrats in the realm tasked with coming up with ideas as to how this work could be carried out more efficiently have started submitting their proposals. Several of the bureaucrats are convinced that you should demand assistance from various temples in the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_12;Order the temples to assist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_12;I don't need their help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_13;While you normally would issue directives through the bureaucrats at your court and let them handle the task of informing the people in the Middle Kingdom as to what you desire, the preparations being made for the Treasure Fleet's departure are more important than most matters, so perhaps you should make a public speech.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_13;I will make a speech!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_13;I have better things to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_14;You journey to one of the major ports where the ships of the Treasure Fleet are being readied and order the work crews to assemble in the same place. Though this briefly interrupts their work, your speech is quite inspiring, and over the next few days you receive reports that the workers are working quite a bit harder now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_14;Just as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_15;You journey to one of the major ports where the ships of the Treasure Fleet are being readied and order the work crews to assemble in the same place. Though you expected this to not be overly disruptive, your speech leaves something to be desired, and some officals carefully but strongly urge you not to give another speech.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_15;That did not go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_16;As the various foreign barbarians due to be visited by the Treasure Fleet doubtlessly are envious of the Middle Kingdom it would be foolish not to have the Treasure Fleet accompanied by a large number of soldiers. Relevant preparations are already underway, but perhaps it would be wise for you to get personally involved in the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_16;I will issue some directives!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_16;I have better things to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_17;You gather your generals together, both those that are due to depart with the Treasure Fleet and those that are to stay inside the borders of the Middle Kingdom, and inform them that you have specific instructions regarding the Treasure Fleet's protection. Several of those present compliment you on your attention to the Thirty-Six Stratagems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_17;Just as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_18;You gather your generals together, both those that are due to depart with the Treasure Fleet and those that are to stay inside the borders of the Middle Kingdom, and inform them that you have specific instructions regarding the Treasure Fleet's protection. Your proposals are met with silence and skeptical looks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_18;That did not go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_19;Though the Treasure Fleet is meant to show of the might and splendor of the Middle Kingdom, it is also an opportunity to ensure that trade along the maritime Silk Road continues to operate effectively. Perhaps the bureaucrats have already figured out how this could be accomplished, but it is possible you could help out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_19;I know a few things about trade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_19;I have better things to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_20;You order the bureaucrats charged with overseeing the trade-related preparations for the Treasure Fleet to provide you with detailed notes regarding their plans and the reasoning behind those plans so that you may review them. Most of the reasoning seems sound, but you discover a few things that can be improved..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_20;Just as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_21;You order the bureaucrats charged with overseeing the trade-related preparations for the Treasure Fleet to provide you with detailed notes regarding their plans and the reasoning behind those plans so that you may review them. You order several changes that you believe to be beneficial, but it turns out they were anything but.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_21;That did not go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_22;Though matters in various realms outside the Middle Kingdom's borders usually are not important enough to concern the Dragon Throne you still have some agents in foreign lands to keep you appraised of any developments that actually are important. Perhaps it would be wise to go over their reports yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_22;Get me the agents' reports !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_22;I have better things to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_23;The reports from your agents are quite extensive and stretch back several years. It takes you several days to go over them, but eventually you start to get a sense for what is going on elsewhere, and you also discover that there might be foreign agents inside the Middle Kingdom itself, and these discoveries makes it possible to capture them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_23;Just as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_24;The reports from your agents are quite extensive and stretch back several years. It takes you several days to go over them, and you do not notice anything of importance. However, a few days later you receive word that foreign agents ihave been causing trouble in several ports where the Treasure Fleet is being readied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_24;That did not go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_25;Though the various uncivilized realms outside the Middle Kingdom's borders usually are not worthy of attention from scholars, there are still a few scholars that have seen fit to write books on the history and politics of the rest of the world. The knowledge in those books might be useful when it comes to preparing the Treasure Fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_25;I will consult my books!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_25;I have better things to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_26;There are surprisingly many books in the palace library concerned with foreign realms, and not all of them are up to date, but eventually you find some promising books. It takes you a few days to read the important bits, but when you are done you have some ideas as to what kind of people might be worth sending with the Treasure Fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_26;Just as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_27;There are surprisingly many books in the palace library concerned with foreign realms, and not all of them are up to date, but eventually you find some promising books. However, it does not take long after you have given the order for various people to accompany the fleet before you discover that your suggestions might not be feasible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_27;That did not go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_28;Though most of the people that will be journeying with the Treasure Fleet are lesser officials, common sailors, and ordinary soldiers it is unlikely that there will not be any people of note accompanying it, and someone as improtant as you should likely be able to receive permission to voyage with it, if that is your desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_28;I will ask to join!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_28;I have no wish to join!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_29;As the Dragon Throne owes you a Favor it would be possible to use that Favor to secure permission to accompany the Treasure Fleet. Of course, if you have better use for that Favor you could just ask, even though that might result in some other form of payment being requested in exchange for the permission you seek.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_29;I will call in my Favor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_29;I will just ask!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_30;My liege,\nI hereby call in the Favor you owe me and demand that you permit me to accompany the Treasure Fleet on its voyage.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_30;I suppose that's fair...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_31;My liege,\nI humbly request that you permit me to accompany the Treasure Fleet on its voyage. Surely this would be to the benefit to the Dragon Throne itself and to all of the Middle Kingdom.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_31;I see no reason to refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_31;You will have to pay me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TREASURE_FLEET_31;I could accept it, as a Favor...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_TREASURE_FLEET_31;You would have to owe me a Favor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_TREASURE_FLEET_31;Request denied!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_32;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nThe [From.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [From.GetTitledName] has received your request for permission to accompany the Treasure Fleet and wishes to let you know that you hereby receive said permission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_33;A fair exchange!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_33;[From.GetSheHeCap] asks too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_34;My liege,\nI hereby accept the proposed payment for permission to accompany the Treasure Fleet, as said payment certainly is a fair request.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_34;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_35;My liege,\nI hereby refuse the proposed payment for permission to accompany the Treasure Fleet, as said payment is more than I am prepared to pay for said permission.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_36;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nThe [From.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [From.GetTitledName] has received your request for permission to accompany the Treasure Fleet and wishes to let you know that it can be arranged, if you are willing to consider it a repayment of the Favor the Dragon Throne owes you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_36;[From.GetSheHeCap] asks too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_37;My liege,\nI am prepared to consider permission to accompany the Treasure Fleet a Favor, and hereby consider the Favor the Dragon Throne owed me repaid in exchange for said permission.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_37;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_38;My liege,\nI must inform your that I refuse to consider permission to accompany the Treasure Fleet a worthwhile repayment of the Favor the Dragon Throne owes me, and thereby refuse the proposed agreement.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_40;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_41;My liege,\nI must inform your that I refuse to consider permission to accompany the Treasure Fleet a Favor, and thereby have to refuse the proposed agreement.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_42;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nThe [From.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [From.GetTitledName] has received your request for permission to accompany the Treasure Fleet and regrets having to inform you that no such permission will be forthcoming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_42;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tf_join_request;Requested to join the Treasure Fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tf_joining_refused;Forbidden to join the Treasure Fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_43;It is no surprise that word about the Treasure Fleet has spread far and wide, but you are still somewhat surprised when you learn that a number of foreign shipwrights have expressed an interest in helping out. Though it is unclear why they seek to help, the price they ask is fairly low, and perhaps there is merit in accepting their offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_43;I'll hire them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_43;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_44;The foreign shipwrights have started to help out with the construction of the Treasure Fleet, and though some of them have found it hard to communicate exactly what they mean with the locals they clearly know their trade as you have received several reports suggesting that they will allow for a substantial expansion of the fleet's size.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_44;That worked out quite well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_45;The foreign shipwrights have started to help out with the construction of the Treasure Fleet, and the reports you have received since their arrival are anything but good. The foreigners have proven to be both unable to communicate with the local shipwrights and unwilling to cooperate with them, and their presence might turn out to be detrimental.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_45;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_46;As the Treasure Fleet preparations continue you are wondering if you perhaps should offer to help [Root.GetChinaShortName] with the preparations, in exchange for some kind of payment. After all, you are not expected to contribute, so expecting something in return for your help would not be out of place...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_46;I will ask for Grace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_46;I will ask for a looser relationship!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TREASURE_FLEET_46;I see no reason to help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_47;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], offering to provide some supplies for the Treasure Fleet in exchange for a substantial amount of Grace. The offer is reasonably generous, though it is possible that you one day might come to regret it as it is uncertain what they might ask for in exchange for the Grace should you grant it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_47;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_47;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_48;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nThe [From.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [From.GetTitledName] has received your offer to provide supplies for the Treasure Fleet in exchange for Grace and has come to the conclusion that such an agreement indeed is mutually beneficial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_48;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_49;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nThe [From.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [From.GetTitledName] has received your offer to provide supplies for the Treasure Fleet in exchange for Grace and has come to the conclusion that such an agreement would not be mutually beneficial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_49;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_50;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], offering to provide some supplies for the Treasure Fleet in exchange for a somewhat looser tributary relationship. Though it might be a bit unwise to agree to such a change to the terms of your relationship, the offer is fairly generous, so it would not be entirely unreasonable to accept it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_50;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_50;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_51;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting].

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_52;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_53;You have been paying some attention to the work being done on the Treasure Fleet and have wondered whether it would be possible to disrupt it in the name of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName].

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_53;It will burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_53;It is too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_54;You journey to one of the ports where the Treasure Fleet is being constructed and sneak up to the construction site under the cover of darkness.

EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_55;You have just received a report that someone managed to sneak up to some of the ships that were supposed to be part of the Treasure Fleet and set them ablaze under the cover of darkness.

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_57;At least [From.GetSheHe] got caught...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_58;You journey to one of the ports where the Treasure Fleet is being constructed and sneak up to the construction site under the cover of darkness.

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_58;At least I escaped...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_59;You have just received a report that someone managed to sneak up to some of the ships that were supposed to be part of the Treasure Fleet and almost set them ablaze before the guards could intervene.

EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_60;You journey to one of the ports where the Treasure Fleet is being constructed and sneak up to the construction site under the cover of darkness.

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_131;No! Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_132;One day when you are taking a walk on the ship you are aboard your feet slip as you step in a small puddle. You try to catch yourself on the railing, but fail to do so, and you drop into the water some distance away from the ship, seemingly without anyone having noticed what happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_132;I must swim back to the ship!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_133;You make your way back towards the ship and spot [treasure_fleet_savior.GetBestName] above you. You catch [treasure_fleet_savior.GetHerHis] attention and [treasure_fleet_savior.GetSheHe] offers to toss you a rope to help you to safety, in exchange for a Favor to be repaid at a future date.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_133;I'll repay you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_133;I don't need your help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_134;You accept the offer made by [treasure_fleet_savior.GetBestName] and [treasure_fleet_savior.GetSheHe] tosses you a rope as [treasure_fleet_savior.GetSheHe] said that [treasure_fleet_savior.GetSheHe] would, and you climb to safety easily enough. Hopefully, the Favor you now owe [treasure_fleet_savior.GetBestName] will not be too much to bear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_134;It was worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_135;You refuse [treasure_fleet_savior.GetBestName]'s offer to help you aboard the ship, unwilling to owe [treasure_fleet_savior.GetHerHim] a Favor, and instead climb up the side of the ship. It is rather difficult, and you start having second thoughts after a while, but eventually you manage to climb all the way to the top without assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_135;I didn't need help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_136;You refuse [treasure_fleet_savior.GetBestName]'s offer to help you aboard the ship, unwilling to owe [treasure_fleet_savior.GetHerHim] a Favor, and instead climb up the side of the ship. A wave hits you when you are halfway up, and you lose your grip. Though you try to swim back to the ship again, you are unable to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_136;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_137;You make your way back towards the ship and start climbing up the side. It is a difficult climb, as the ship hardly was designed to let someone climb up its side, but you manage to make it all the way back up to the top and then pull yourself to safety. Though the experience was unpleasant, you survived it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_137;I saved myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_138;You try to swim back towards the ship, but it is moving rather more quickly than you can swim, and you are unable to reach it. You try to cry out to catch the attention of anyone aboard, but nobody seems to notice you, and none of the other ships are close enough for you to reach them. You keep on swimming until your strength gives out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_138;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_139;Recently you have been spending some time in the company of [treasure_fleet_friend.GetBestName] as the two of you are passengers aboard the same ship, and though you did not know one another very well to begin with [treasure_fleet_friend.GetSheHe] and you have realized that you have a lot in common and that you enjoy each other's company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_139;[treasure_fleet_friend.GetSheHeCap] is a true friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_140;Recently you have been spending some time in the company of [From.GetBestName] as the two of you are passengers aboard the same ship, and though you did not know one another very well to begin with [From.GetSheHe] and you have realized that you have a lot in common and that you enjoy each other's company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_140;[From.GetSheHeCap] is a true friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_141;The journey from one port to another has given you time to get to others aboard your ship. One of them, [treasure_fleet_lover.GetBestName], is a rather fascinating [treasure_fleet_lover.GetManWoman], and you have found yourself enjoying [treasure_fleet_lover.GetHerHis] company quite a bit. Lately, you have been wondering if you should try for something more with [treasure_fleet_lover.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_141;I will seduce [treasure_fleet_lover.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_141;I will do no such thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_142;You have spent quite some time in the company of [From.GetBestName] recently, and the two of you have generally gotten along quite well. Even so, it is somewhat surprising when [From.GetSheHe] one day suggests that perhaps the two of you should find someplace private so that you might get to know one another more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_142;A lovely idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_142;You and me? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_143;[From.GetBestName] informs you that [From.GetSheHe] has no interest in getting to know you more intimately, and suggests that you drop the matter so that the two of you can pretend that it never was brought up in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_143;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_144;[From.GetBestName] is quite open to the suggestion that the two of you should find someplace private to get to know one another far more intimately. Some time later, after a rather enjoyable series of events, you find yourself wondering whether you should try to sneak off somewhere with [From.GetBestName] again in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_144;We should do this again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_144;Let's not make a habit of it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_145;You and [From.GetBestName] find an empty cabin easily enough and spend some rather enjoyable time together. As the two of you start getting dressed again [From.GetSheHe] tells you that [From.GetSheHe] looks forward to the next time the two of you can meet in private, and you find yourself looking forward to it as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_145;Perhaps tomorrow again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_146;You and [From.GetBestName] find an empty cabin easily enough and spend some rather enjoyable time together. As the two of you start getting dressed again [From.GetSheHe] tells you that [From.GetSheHe] had a wonderful time but that it probably is a good idea for the two of you not to make a habit out of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_146;Perhaps that's for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_147;Though you do not mind the company of most of the people aboard your ship [treasure_fleet_rival.GetBestName] is not someone whose company is remotely enjoyable. [treasure_fleet_rival.GetSheHeCap] always gets on your nerves, always contradicts you over even the smallest thing, and is thoroughly unpleasant to have to deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_147;I hope [treasure_fleet_rival.GetSheHe] falls off the ship!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_148;Though you do not mind the company of most of the people aboard your ship [From.GetBestName] is not someone whose company is remotely enjoyable.

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_148;I hope [From.GetSheHe] falls off the ship!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_149;You are having trouble falling asleep one night and decide to take a walk along the deck of the ship. As you exit onto the deck you spot [treasure_fleet_rival_to_kill.GetBestName] standing near the railing some distance away. Your hated rival does not appear to have noticed your presence, and [treasure_fleet_rival_to_kill.GetHerHis] position looks quite precarious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_149;I can give [treasure_fleet_rival_to_kill.GetHerHim] a push...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_149;It is too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_150;You are standing at the railing of the ship late one evening, looking out over the water and pondering various matters when you suddenly feel a hand on your back. Before you can react you are pushed over the railing and into the water below. You are not sure who your attacker was, and right now you need to focus on getting to safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_150;I need to get back aboard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_151;You manage to swim back to the ship and climb your way back aboard without too much difficulty. Taking a look around, you do not see anyone else, so your attacker probably saw fit to slip away while you were getting back to the ship, and their identity remains unknown to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_151;I need to watch my back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_152;Doing your best to stay out of sight, you watch as [From.GetBestName] climbs back onto the ship. As best you can tell, [From.GetSheHe] is unaware that it was you who sent [From.GetHerHim] into the water, but even so [From.GetSheHe] is likely to be on [From.GetHerHis] guard from now on, making further attempts on [From.GetHerHis] life far riskier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_152;Unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_153;You try to swim back to the ship, but it is moving more quickly than you can swim, and thus you keep getting further and further away. Though you cry out for help and hope that someone aboard one of the other ships will notice you, nobody comes to your rescue, and as you are quite far from the nearest shore you know that you will not survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_153;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_154;[From.GetBestName] did not spot you when you pushed [From.GetHerHim] over the railing, and [From.GetSheHe] also did not notice that you were watching as [From.GetSheHe] failed to swim back to the ship. You do not see [From.GetHerHim] drown as the fleet is moving too quickly, but you are still quite satisfied with the outcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_154;Just as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_155;You are standing at the railing of the ship late one evening, looking out over the water and pondering various matters when you suddenly feel a hand on your back. You manage to turn around to see that the hand belongs to [From.GetBestName] before [From.GetSheHe] gives you a push and sends you over the railing and into the water below.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_155;I need to get back aboard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_156;You manage to swim back to the ship and climb your way back aboard without too much difficulty. [FromFrom.GetBestName] is nowhere to be seen, as [FromFrom.GetSheHe] apparently saw fit to leave while you were in the water, and with no witnesses around it is unlikely to be possible to get [FromFrom.GetHerHim] locked up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_156;I will remember this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_157;Doing your best to stay out of sight, you watch as [From.GetBestName] climbs back onto the ship. [From.GetSheHeCap] saw you push [From.GetHerHim] into the water, and thus [From.GetSheHe] likely will be on [From.GetHerHis] guard from now on, particularly around you, making further attempts on [From.GetHerHis] life far riskier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_157;That did not go as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_158;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_159;[From.GetBestName] spotted you when you pushed [From.GetHerHim] over the railing, which might have been a problem if [From.GetSheHe] had managed to make [From.GetHerHis] way back to the ship. Luckily for you, that did not happen, and though you do not see [From.GetHerHim] drown as the fleet is moving too quickly you are still quite satisfied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_159;It worked well enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_160;You are standing at the railing of the ship late one evening, looking out over the water and pondering various matters when you suddenly feel a hand on your back. The hand gives you a push, clearly attempting to send you over the railing, but you avoid falling into the water. Your assailant manages to vanish before you can catch up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_160;Who was that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_161;Your attempt to push [From.GetBestName] overboard did not work out, and [From.GetSheHe] nearly saw you as you hurried away after the failed attempt. You manage to get inside and into hiding before [From.GetBestName] managed to catch up to you, and [From.GetSheHe] is unlikely to know for certain that it was you who attacked [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_161;At least I wasn't seen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_162;You are standing at the railing of the ship late one evening, looking out over the water and pondering various matters when you suddenly feel a hand on your back. The hand gives you a push, clearly attempting to send you over the railing, but you manage to stay aboard the ship. Turning around, you can see [From.GetBestName] running away from you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_162;You DARE?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_163;Your attempt to push [From.GetBestName] overboard did not work out, and [From.GetSheHe] managed to see you as you hurried away, as evident by the fact that [From.GetSheHe] cursed your name. Luckily for you, [From.GetBestName] was too preoccupied to give chase, and with no witnesses to support [From.GetHerHim] you are unlikely to get locked up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_163;That did not go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_164;You are standing at the railing of the ship late one evening, looking out over the water and pondering various matters when you hear someone moving up behind you. You quickly dodge out of the way as [From.GetBestName] attempts to push you over the railing. You take the opportunity to return the favor, sending [From.GetHerHim] into the water below.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_164;Turnabout is fair play!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_165;You attempt to sneak up on [From.GetBestName] to push [From.GetHerHim] over the railing, but as you draw close [From.GetSheHe] suddenly turns around and gives you a smile as [From.GetSheHe] dodges out of the way. Surprised by this development, you are caught off balance, and as a result you are sent over the railing and into the water below.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_165;I must get back to safety!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_166;[FromFrom.GetBestName] is nowhere to be seen when you climb back onto the ship, but you are certain that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] will be keeping [FromFrom.GetHerHis] guard up around you from now on and that any further attack you make is even less likely to succeed. Even worse, [From.GetSheHe] might seek to strike at you first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_166;This really did not go as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_167;You watch as [From.GetBestName] swims back towards the ship and make sure that you disappear from sight before [From.GetSheHe] has climbed back aboard. It seems your attacker will remain alive and that [From.GetSheHe] might trouble you again in the future, but at least you managed to foil this particular attempt on your life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_167;At least I know who to watch...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_168;You try to swim back to the ship, but it is moving more quickly than you can swim, and thus you keep getting further and further away.

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_169;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_170;One day you notice a school of dolphins a short distance away from your ship. They do not seem to be paying you or the Treasure Fleet much attention, and instead seem preoccupied with making small jumps above the waves for some unknown reason. Whatever the reason migth be, they put on quite the show.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_170;How curious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_171;You are taking a walk across the deck of your ship and decide to head to the stern to get a closer look at some interesting clouds behind you. However, when you get to the stern you notice movement in the water behind the ship and forget all about the clouds as you notice that there are several rather large sharks following the ship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_171;They look quite vicious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_172;One day when you look down into the water beneath the ship you spot a large number of turtles swimming past, several of them quite large. As best you can tell they do not seem to care about the ships above their heads, and you suppose that they have little reason to concern themselves with such things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_172;I wonder where they are going...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_173;Your ship has been sent some distance away from the main body of the Treasure Fleet to scout, and though you had not expected to find anything interesting you discover a drifting ship. As best you can tell, it is largely intact, but there is no crew to be seen, which is quite odd as it hardly coudl sail itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_173;We must investigate it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_173;It is too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_174;You order your ship to move closer to the other ship and jump across alongside several of the sailors, weapons at the ready. The drifting ship is much smaller than your ship, so it does not take you long to search every part of it for its crew, but there does not appear to be anyone present.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_174;Curious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_175;You order your ship to move closer to the other ship and jump across alongside several of the sailors, weapons at the ready. The drifting ship is much smaller than your ship, so it does not take you long to search every part of it for its crew, and eventually you find a pile of bodies in one of the rooms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Suddenly, a man bearing a wicked sword drops down from the ceiling right in front of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_176;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_177;The man laughs as he attacks you and the sailors with you, and his attacks are quite fierce. However, once the initial surprise wears off you have little trouble defending yourself, and it is not long before he has been overwhelmed and killed. Once he has been dealt with the search continues, but there is nobody else aboard the ship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_177;That wasn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_178;The man laughs as he attacks you and the sailors with you, and his attacks are quite fierce.

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_178;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_179;The man laughs as he attacks you and the sailors with you, and his attacks are quite fierce. You and the others struggle quite a bit to fight back, and you take a rather nasty wound before one of the sailors finally cuts the man down. Once he has been dealt with the search continues, but there is nobody else aboard the ship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_179;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_180;The man laughs as he attacks you and the sailors with you, and his attacks are quite fierce.

EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_181;Your ship has been sent some distance away from the main body of the Treasure Fleet to scout, and though you had not expected to find anything interesting you come across a small island that does not appear on any of the maps you have seen.

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_181;We should investigate it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_181;Let's keep sailing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_182;You order your ship to drop its anchor and for a boat to be readied to bring you and some of the sailors ashore.

EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_183;You order your ship to drop its anchor and for a boat to be readied to bring you and some of the sailors ashore.

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_184;Let's get back to the ship!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_185;One evening you notice some storm clouds in the distance. You are about to turn away from them after concluding that they are too distant to be a concern when you see what looks like a ship beneath the clouds. It is too distant to tell for sure, but it almost looks as if it is hovering above the water...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_185;Ominous...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_186;One day the lookouts call out that there are many sails on the horizon.

EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_245;One night the Treasure Fleet comes under attack from several ships bearing the flag of [From.GetBestName]. Luckily enough, the defenders are vigilant enough to spot the attackers before they get close, and thus they have little difficulty repelling the attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_245;[From.GetSheHeCap] dares?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_246;Word has reached you that the Treasure Fleet has come under attack from [From.GetBestName]. It seems the attack was rather unsuccessful, as [From.GetSheHe] clearly underestimated the might of the Dragon Throne, but the fact that there was an attack in the first place is quite concerning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_246;There will be a reckoning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_247;Your forces set sail under the cover of darkness, with detailed plans in place for how they will approach the Treasure Fleet and deal with its defenders. Though the defenders on some of the ships are able to prevent your soldiers from getting close, several ships are still set ablaze, proving that you are not to be dismissed out of hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_247;That worked reasonably well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_248;One night the Treasure Fleet comes under attack from several ships bearing the flag of [From.GetBestName]. It seems the sentries that had been posted were not as vigilant as they should have been, as the attackers got close to many of the ships without being spotted, and as a result the ships in question are now ablaze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_250;Word has reached you that the Treasure Fleet has come under attack from [From.GetBestName]. The attack was not entirely unsuccessful, so [From.GetSheHe] might now be even more emboldened to stand up to the Dragon Throne, and the fact that there was an attack in the first place is quite concerning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_250;There will be a reckoning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_251;You spend some time planning out the attack on the Treasure Fleet, knowing that a failed attack could be something you would end up regretting, and the planning pays off as the fleet is set ablaze down to the last ship. Anyone that makes it to the shore will be rounded up and brought before you in chains so that you may judge them as you wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_251;Such pretty bonfires!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_252;One night you are awakened by the sound of fighting nearby. You quickly get dressed and head outside with your weapon ready, discovering that your ship and all the others are under attack by forces loyal to [From.GetBestName]. It is clear that the fighting is not going to go your way, as several ships are already ablaze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_252;I will try to get ashore, come what may...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_253;Word has reached you that the Treasure Fleet has come under attack from [From.GetBestName], and though the sailors and soldiers of the Treasure Fleet reportedly fought valiantly the attack was a complete success.

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_254;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_255;In order to ensure the continuing prosperity and stability of your realm it might be beneficial to enter into a tributary agreement with the Middle Kingdom, seeing you clearly are within its reach. Some of the officials aboard the Treasure Fleet should be able to help with the necessary paperwork.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_255;Such a relationship would be good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_255;I think not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_256;A petition has arrived from [From.GetBestName], requesting that you help [From.GetHerHim] with the necessary paperwork to set up a tributary agreement between [From.GetHerHim] and the Dragon Throne. Given that the matter will have to be decided without input from the Dragon Throne, it is up to you to accept or refuse the proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_256;A very acceptable proposal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_256;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_257;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], carrying with him detailed paperwork outlining a tributary agreement between you and the Dragon Throne. Some of the details might not have been quite what you expected initially, but it is still an overall acceptable agreement, so you see no reason to object.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_257;Just as I expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_258;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], carrying with him a very detailed list of reasons for why you are unworthy of paying tribute to the Dragon Throne. Given how extensive the list is, it seems quite futile to try to convince [From.GetHerHim] that you actually are worthy of such an agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_258;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_259;With the Treasure Fleet just off the coast it is clear that the Dragon Throne has an interest in your realm, and thus it might be a good idea to ensure that the Middle Kingdom thinks highly of you. A small gift of gold presented to an official accompanying the Treasure Fleet could probably accomplish this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_259;It is a good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_259;I'd rather keep the money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_260;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], bringing a large amount of gold that is being offered in return for you making sure that the Dragon Throne looks favorably on [From.GetHerHim]. If desirable, it would be trivial to ensure that the money got misplaced without anyone noticing, should you wish to keep it for yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_260;I accept the money, for the Dragon Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_260;I accept the money, for myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TREASURE_FLEET_260;This deal is unacceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_261;The messenger you sent to the Treasure Fleet has returned, bringing word that [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to accept your offer on behalf of the Dragon Throne. It is possible that the money will end up in [From.GetHerHim] pockets, of course, but as long as the Dragon Throne regards you more highly that would not be a problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_261;Either works for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_262;The messenger you sent to the Treasure Fleet has returned, bringing word that [From.GetBestName] refused your offer, and that the refusal was worded in a way that made it clear that it would be foolhardy to try to make the same offer to someone else, particularly as it then might look like attempted bribery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_262;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_263;With the Treasure Fleet just off the coast it is clear that the Dragon Throne has an interest in your realm, and thus it might be a good idea to ensure that the Middle Kingdom thinks highly of you. You could offer to gift an artifact to one of the officials accompanying the fleet in exchange for help with that..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_263;It is a good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_263;This isn't a good idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_264;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], bringing an aftifact that is being offered in exchange for your help in ensuring that the Dragon Throne thinks more highly of [From.GetBestName]. The artifact does not look like something that would be worth passing on to the Dragon Throne, but it might still be useful for you..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_264;I accept this offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_264;I have no use for such trinkets!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_265;The messenger you sent to the Treasure Fleet has returned, bringing word that [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to accept the artifact you offered in exchange for ensuring that the Dragon Throne thinks more highly of you. It is perhaps not appealing to part with such an item at most times, but this time it was likely worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_265;I knew it would work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_266;The messenger you sent to the Treasure Fleet has returned, bringing word that [From.GetBestName] refused your offer as the artifact being offered was viwed as nothing but a paltry triket. It seems the people of the Middle Kingdom possibly have more expensive or more specific tastes than you had anticipated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_266;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_267;You have had the opportunity to meet with several minor officials accompanying the Treasure Fleet over the course of the last few days, and though they do not believe in [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] or the [Root.Religion.GetName] you have come to realize that you still agree with them on many points.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_297;Though not every official that received an invitation to your feast accepted the invitation, quite a few did, and your servants have been hard at work preparing for the feast.

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_297;Welcome! Welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_298;You and some other officials from the Treasure Fleet depart to the feast being arranged by [From.GetBestName] together, curious about what a local feast is going to be like.

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_298;This could turn out quite nicely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_300;You make sure to spend some time with each of the guests from the Treasure Fleet, as one would expect from a good host, but as the evening progresses you eventually end up spending quite a bit more time in the company of [tf_feast_event_target.GetBestName] than most, as [tf_feast_event_target.GetSheHe] has turned out to be a very interesting person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_300;We have a lot in common!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_301;Your host, [From.GetBestName], spends some time with each of [From.GetHerHis] guests, which is only fitting, but as the evening progresses the two of you end up spending more time in each other's company than [From.GetSheHe] spends with any other guest. To your great surprise and pleasure, [From.GetSheHe] is a very interesting individual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_301;We have a lot in common!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_302;You make sure to spend some time with each of the guests from the Treasure Fleet, as one would expect from a good host.

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_302;What a poor guest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_303;Your host, [From.GetBestName], spends some time with each of [From.GetHerHis] guests, which is only fitting, but [From.GetSheHe] is being quite rude in your opinion and is treating you much worse than [From.GetSheHe] treats everyone else. As the evening progresses you become more and more convinced you never should have accepted the invitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_303;What a poor host!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_305;As the evening progresses you find yourself fascinated by [tf_feast_event_target.GetBestName], a most exotic [tf_feast_event_target.GetManWoman]. [tf_feast_event_target.GetSheHeCap] seems to be interested in you as well, and it would probably be easy for the two of you to head off someplace private if that was desirable for the both of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_305;Can I show you my bedroom?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_305;I have to go speak to someone else!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_306;[From.GetBestName] is a rather fascinating host, and [From.GetSheHe] has been finding excuses to speak to you time and time again during the evening. As such, it is not entirely surprising when [From.GetSheHe] suggests that perhaps you would like to see [From.GetHerHis] bedroom, with clear implications as to what that entails.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_306;Yes, I would like to see your bedroom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_306;What kind of person do you take me for?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_307;[From.GetBestName] takes several steps away from you when you make your suggestion, telling you that you must have mistaken [From.GetHerHim] for some other and far less morally upright person. You attempt to salvage the situation, but [From.GetSheHe] quickly finds an excuse to leave your presence, and avoids you for the rest of the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_307;I should not have bothered...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_308;[From.GetBestName] is quite receptive to your offer to show [From.GetHerHim] your bedroom, and the two of you quietly slip away from the others at the feast and head off elsewhere. Much later, you find yourself wondering if you should make an attempt to turn this into something lasting or if it perhaps would be too much trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_308;We can make it work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_308;It's too much effort...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_309;You and [From.GetBestName] slip away from the other people at the feast easily enough and head towards [From.GetHerHis] bedroom, undressing almost as soon as the door is closed behind you. Much later, as you are getting dressed, [From.GetBestName] tells you that [From.GetSheHe] think you can make this work despite the distance involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_309;We can make it work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_310;You and [From.GetBestName] slip away from the other people at the feast easily enough and head towards [From.GetHerHis] bedroom, undressing almost as soon as the door is closed behind you. Much later, as you are getting dressed, [From.GetBestName] tells you that it probably would be too difficult for you to make things work in the longer term.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_310;It would be too much effort...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_311;You do your best to keep your guests entertained and to try to get to know them a bit better, but since they are foreigners you do not have quite the same expectations. One very innocent question you ask turns out to be quite rude as far as your guests are concerned. You quickly apologize, but the damage has already been done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_311;I misspoke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_312;Your host, [From.GetBestName], seems to be making an effort to be a good host, and you try to keep an open mind as [From.GetSheHe] is a foreigner, but there are limits to what can be tolerated, and some of the questions [From.GetSheHe] asks are quite rude. [From.GetSheHeCap] apologizes, but you are still offended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_312;How embarrassing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_313;One of your guests, [From.GetBestName], seems to be making an effort to be a good guest, and you try to keep an open mind as [From.GetSheHe] is a foreigner, but there are limits to what can be tolerated, and some of the questions [From.GetSheHe] asks are quite rude. Unintentional or not, you still have the right to be offended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_313;How embarrassing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_314;You do your best to be a good guest and to get to know your host better, but since [From.GetBestName] is a foreigner you do not have quite the same expectations. One very innocent question you ask turns out to be quite rude as far as your host is concerned. You quickly apologize, but the damage has already been done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_314;I misspoke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_315;It seems one of your guests, [tf_feast_event_target.GetBestName], has misjudged how much [tf_feast_event_target.GetSheHe] can drink, as [tf_feast_event_target.GetSheHe] suddenly presents you with a hastily written but legible document certifying that the Dragon Throne is in your debt, which certainly is likely to be useful in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_315;Don't look a gift horse in the mouth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_316;You are having a good time at the feast [From.GetBestName] has arranged for you and some others from the Treasure Fleet, and you find yourself having quite a few drinks. It turns out that you probably had a few more than you should have, as you come to realize that you have promised that the Dragon Throne will reward your host in the future;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_316;I did what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_317;It seems one of your guests, [tf_feast_event_target.GetBestName], has misjudged how much [tf_feast_event_target.GetSheHe] can drink, as [tf_feast_event_target.GetSheHe] suddenly presents you with a hastily written but legible document that alters the existing tributary relationship you have with the Dragon Throne quite a bit in your favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_317;Well, that is certainly acceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_318;You are having a good time at the feast [From.GetBestName] has arranged for you and some others from the Treasure Fleet, and you find yourself having quite a few drinks. It turns out that you probably had a few more than you should have, as you realize too late that you have arranged for a much looser tributary relationship for your host;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_318;I did what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_319;You are having a good time at the feast [From.GetBestName] has arranged for you and some others from the Treasure Fleet, and you find yourself having quite a few drinks. It turns out that you probably had a few more than you should have, as you give a priceless artifact to your host without asking for anything in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_319;I did what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_320;It seems one of your guests, [From.GetBestName], has misjudged how much [From.GetSheHe] can drink, as [From.GetSheHe] drunkedly proclaims that you are worthy of a gift from the Dragon Throne and gestures for some of the servants [From.GetSheHe] brought from the Treasure Fleet to present it to you. It turns out to be a Chinese artifact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_320;I see no reason to refuse this gift!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_321;During the feast you have arranged for some officials from the Treasure Fleet you notice that [tf_feast_event_target.GetBestName] and [tf_feast_event_target_2.GetBestName] have been spending a lot of time together, and based on what you can see the two of them are very likely to consider each other friends from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_321;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_322;You find yourself spending quite a bit of time in the company of [tf_feast_event_target_2.GetBestName] at the feast [From.GetBestName] has arranged, and the two of you are getting along quite well. You expect that the two of you will be friends from now on, and that might one day turn out to be beneficial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_322;Such a nice person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_323;During the feast you have arranged for some officials from the Treasure Fleet you notice that [tf_feast_event_target.GetBestName] and [tf_feast_event_target_2.GetBestName] seem to have taken a dislike to each other, and based on what your servants report when you question them the two of them have come to hate one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_323;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_324;You find yourself spending some time in the company of [tf_feast_event_target_2.GetBestName] at the feast [From.GetBestName] has arranged, and [tf_feast_event_target_2.GetSheHe] turns out to be a thoroughly unpleasant individual who seems determined to insult you with every breath. You are certain you will not miss [tf_feast_event_target_2.GetHerHis] company after tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_324;Such an unpleasant person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_325;As the evening goes on you find yourself relaxing as things seem to be going quite well. Unfortunately, you should perhaps not have relaxed quite as much as you did, as you make a careless statement that all of your guests seem to take as an insult directed directly at the Dragon Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_325;I should not have said that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_326;You are having a good time at the feast [From.GetBestName] has arranged, and [From.GetSheHe] seems like a good host to you intially. However, as the evening goes on [From.GetSheHe] starts making statements that are less and less appropriate, and one of them is a direct insult to the Dragon Throne itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_326;I expected far better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_327;One of your guests, [tf_feast_event_target.GetBestName], is really getting on your nerves. Though there are certain things that are expected of a host, you are starting to feel that [tf_feast_event_target.GetSheHe] no longer deserves protection as your guest. Your guards might be able to drag [tf_feast_event_target.GetHerHim] to the dungeon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_327;Try to imprison [tf_feast_event_target.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_327;Leave [tf_feast_event_target.GetHerHim] be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_328;You are in the middle of a conversation with some of the other people at [From.GetBestName]'s feast when a servant asks you to come meet an important individual. You only realize that it is a trap when you are led into a room filled with guards, who promptly drag you to the dungeons and toss you in a cell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_328;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_329;You give the necessary orders to prepare a trap for [From.GetBestName] and sit back to wait for events to unfold. [From.GetSheHe] is soon led away by a servant, who returns after a few minutes to report that things went as planned and that [From.GetBestName] now is locked away in a cell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_329;Just as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_330;You are enjoying yourself at [From.GetBestName]'s feast when you notice that [FromFrom.GetBestName] no longer is anywhere to be seen. Inquiring about the matter, you discover that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has been imprisoned, and the reasons that are being given appear quite flimsy as far as you can tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_330;I expect better of a host!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_331;You are in the middle of a conversation with some of the other people at [From.GetBestName]'s feast when a servant asks you to come meet an important individual. Something about the woman's behaviour strikes you as odd, and you quietly slip away from her. Given that you soon hear calls for the guards to find you, it probably was a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_331;I knew it was a trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_332;You give the necessary orders to prepare a trap for [From.GetBestName] and sit back to wait for events to unfold. [From.GetSheHe] is soon led away by a servant, and you think that things are going well at first, but as you start to hear your guards call out in confusion nearby it becomes clear that[From.GetBestName] has gotten away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_332;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_333;You are enjoying yourself at [From.GetBestName]'s feast when you suddenly hear shouting nearby. It seems that the guards are looking for [FromFrom.GetBestName], who is nowhere to be seen, and when you ask one of the servants what is going on the woman admits that your host ordered [FromFrom.GetBestName] imprison for seemingly no reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_333;I expect better of a host!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_334;Everyone seems to be having a good time at your feast when [tf_feast_event_target.GetBestName] suddenly stands up clutching [tf_feast_event_target.GetHerHis] throat. Several servants rush over to help, but they are unable to prevent [tf_feast_event_target.GetHerHim] from choking to death on [tf_feast_event_target.GetHerHis] food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_334;How unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_335;You are enjoying yourself at [From.GetBestName]'s feast when you suddenly put some food down the wrong throat. You try to dislodge it as best you can, and several servants come running over to try to help you, but you are unable to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_335;Can't... breathe...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_336;The feast you are hosting for various officials from the Treasure Fleet turns out to be a rather uneventful affair. You were not quite sure what to expect, but you had expected for something a bit more interesting to have happened than everything that has transpired so far, and it is already getting rather late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_336;I suppose it could be worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_337;The feast [From.GetBestName] is hosting turns out to be a rather uneventful affair.

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_337;I suppose it could be worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_338;You have been conversing with your guests about various matters during the course of your feast, and though many would think that discussing religion with strangers would be unwise you have elected to ignore this advice. As a result you have learned quite a few things, and many of them are far more intriguing than you had expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_338;I understand them better now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_339;You discuss various matters with the people at [From.GetBestName]'s feast, and though many would advise against discussing matters of religion with strangers that is something you have been talking about with some of the people present. It turns out that the [From.Religion.GetName] faith is rather intriguing, unlike what you had expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_339;I understand them better now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_340;It is getting quite late and the guests from the Treasure Fleet are starting to excuse themselves from the feast. Given that there doubtlessly are other things they wish to accomplish while they are in the area, it is unlikely that you will be able to arrange another feast, so you will have to be satisfied with what has transpired this evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_340;That's that, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_341;It is getting rather late, and many of the other officials from the Treasure Fleet have already left the feast that [From.GetBestName] arranged for you. Feeling rather tired yourself, you thank your host and excuse yourself, making your way back down towards the harbour and the Treasure Fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_341;It could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_343;Part of the Treasure Fleet's mission is to ensure diplomatic cooperation between distant realms and the Middle Kingdom. As part of this task, several artifacts have been brought along to be offered in exchange for a token payment, and perhaps you should extend such an offer to [tf_interaction_target.GetBestName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_343;Make the offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_343;Do nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_344;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], one of the officials travelling with the Treasure Fleet, who offers to provide an artifact from the Middle Kingdom in exchange for a small payment. The message does not specify what kind of artifact it would be, but it is likely to be a rather exotic item.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_344;Sounds like a deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_344;Not interested!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_345;The messenger you sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to accept the proposed agreement. You give the order for an artifact to be delivered, as promised, and consider what you wish to do with the money that just was delivered into your hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_345;I will be keeping the money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_345;This belongs to the Dragon Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_346;It does not take long before a group of minor officials arrive from the Treasure Fleet, bringing with them the artifact that [From.GetBestName] promised to deliver. It will hopefully be of some use to you in the future, even if you might not know exactly how to best make use of it at this very moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_346;I'll fiture it out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_347;The messenger you sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in the proposed agreement. Maybe you asked for too much money, but as you were making an offer on behalf of the Dragon Throne there was a limit to how generous an offer you could make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_347;It was a fair offer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_348;Part of the Treasure Fleet's mission is to ensure that trade along the Silk Road continues unimpeded.

EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_349;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], one of the officials travelling with the Treasure Fleet, who offers to provide a trade contract with the Middle Kingdom in exchange for a small payment.

You invite [new_tf_character.GetHerHim] inside, and quickly discover that [new_tf_character.GetSheHe] is a courtesan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_374;Not quite what I expected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_375;It does not take long after you agree to the deal with [From.GetBestName] before one of your servants lets you know that a [new_tf_character.GetManWoman] has arrived from the Treasure Fleet.

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_375;Not quite what I expected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_376;It does not take long after you agree to the deal with [From.GetBestName] before one of your servants lets you know that a [new_tf_character.GetManWoman] has arrived from the Treasure Fleet. You invite [new_tf_character.GetHerHim] inside, and quickly discover that [new_tf_character.GetSheHe] is a minor noble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_376;Not quite what I expected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_377;The messenger you sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in the proposed agreement. Maybe you asked for too much money, but as you were making an offer on behalf of the Dragon Throne there was a limit to how generous an offer you could make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_377;It was a fair offer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_378;Though the Treasure Fleet was well provisioned when it left the Middle Kingdom, the supplies are starting to dwindle, and as such it would be prudent to resupply. [tf_interaction_target.GetBestName] should have the necessary supplies, so the main question is how you wish to approach the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_378;I will be diplomatic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_378;I will use force!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TREASURE_FLEET_378;I will not bother with either!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_379;A messenger arrived from [From.GetBestName], requesting permission for the Treasure Fleet to resupply in your lands. A small amount of money is being offered in return, along with the gratitude of the Drgaon Throne, which perhaps could prove to be rather useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_379;I accept your offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_379;I refuse your offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_380;The messenger you sent to [From.GetBestName] returns with word that the Treasure Fleet will be permitted to resupply as you requested. A small monetary payment must be made, of course, but the Treasure Fleet was provided with funds for such eventualities, so it is a trivial thing to arrange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_380;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_381;The messenger you sent to [From.GetBestName] returns with word that the Treasure Fleet will not be permitted to resupply as you requested. The only option that remains to you if you wish to resupply at this time is to use force, which is less certain to work well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_381;Then I will use force!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_381;Then I will ask elsewhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_382;You lead a small detachment of soldiers ashore under the cover of darkness, planning to take what you need from some granaries located near the shoreline. Everything goes according to plan, and you soon return to the fleet as many supplies as you can carry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_382;Bring it all aboard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_383;You lead a small detachment of soldiers ashore under the cover of darkness, planning to take what you need from some granaries located near the shoreline. Unfortunately, the granaries are more heavily guarded than expected, and though you manage to make your way back to the fleet many soldiers are captured or killed in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_383;That did not go as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_384;You lead a small detachment of soldiers ashore under the cover of darkness, planning to take what you need from some granaries located near the shoreline. Unfortunately, the locals have set a trap, and you and your soldiers are easily captured and dragged away in chains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_384;This was not the plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_385;You are awakened early in the morning by a servant bringing word that a messenger has arrived with word that the granaries near the shoreline were attacked during the night, and that a substantial amount of grain has been taken. It is quite clear that the Treasure Fleet was behind the attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_385;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_386;You are awakened early in the morning by a servant bringing word that a messenger has arrived with word that the granaries near the shoreline were attacked during the night, but that the attackers were driven off or captured. It seems the Treasure Fleet was behind the attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_386;At least they failed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_387;You are awakened early in the morning by a servant bringing word that a messenger has arrived with word that the granaries near the shoreline were attacked during the night, but that the guards posted there had set a trap and captured those responsible, including [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_387;Throw this criminal in the dungeon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_388;It is only right and proper for foreign realms to pay tribute to the Dragon Throne, and though it is preferable for them to do so willingly it might be necessary to use force to compel them. You are in a position to attempt to compel [tf_interaction_target.GetBestName] to pay tribute, should you wish to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_388;Suggest a tributary relationship!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_388;I think not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_389;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], an official that is accompanying the Treasure Fleet. [From.GetSheHeCap] suggests that it is in your best interests to enter into a tributary relationship with the Dragon Throne, with the implication that a refusal might result in an attempt to compel you by force of arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_389;I suppose I will accept...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_389;I refuse this outrageous suggestion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_390;The messenger you sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned, bringing word that [From.GetSheHe] wisely has seen fit to enter into a tributary relationship with the Dragon Throne. It is unlikely that the threat of force was appreciated, but sometimes the ends might justify some rather unsavory means.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_390;I did what I had to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_391;The messenger you sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned, bringing word that [From.GetSheHe] is unwilling to enter into a tributary relationship with the Dragon Throne. It seems you will have to resort to military means to achieve such a tributary relationship, if that still is desirable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_391;Then [From.GetSheHe] leaves me no choice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_391;Then that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_392;You have been spending time ashore in several ports in the area where the Treasure Fleet currently is located, trying to learn a little about the foreign ways of the locals. You have learned quite a bit about the [tf_sympathy_target.Religion.GetName] faith as a result, and you have a newfound appreciation for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_392;It is quite interesting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_393;One day when you are ashore you are approached by [new_tf_character.GetBestName], who claims to be a local noble. [new_tf_character.GetSheHeCap] claims to have heard good things about you and the Middle Kingdom, and says that [new_tf_character.GetSheHe] wishes to pledge [new_tf_character.GetHerselfHimself] to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_393;Welcome aboard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_393;Go away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_394;As one of the officials travelling with the Treasure Fleet you are able to arrange for the craftsmen that have accompanied it to construct certain buildings in the area to leave a more lasting reminder of the Treasure Fleet's interests. You could offer to construct such a building in the lands of [tf_interaction_target.GetBestName], if you wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_394;Make the offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_394;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_395;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], an official that is accompanying the Treasure Fleet. [From.GetSheHeCap] offers to arrange for some craftsmen from the Middle Kingdom to construct one useful building or another in your lands in exchange for a small monetary payment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_395;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_395;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_396;The messenger you sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned, bringing with him a small monetary payment. You give the order for the craftsmen accompanying the fleet to construct something, with the specifications up to them, and consider what should do with the money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_396;I will be keeping the money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_396;This belongs to the Dragon Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_397;The craftsmen from the Treasure Fleet arrive promptly and work quickly, only requesting that they are not disturbed and that they are provided with food and water. Before long, the construction is complete. The new paper mill is quite interesting to behold, and you already have some ideas as to how it could be useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_397;This will be useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_398;The craftsmen from the Treasure Fleet arrive promptly and work quickly, only requesting that they are not disturbed and that they are provided with food and water.

EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_400;The craftsmen from the Treasure Fleet arrive promptly and work quickly, only requesting that they are not disturbed and that they are provided with food and water.

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_400;This will be useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_401;The craftsmen from the Treasure Fleet arrive promptly and work quickly, only requesting that they are not disturbed and that they are provided with food and water.

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_401;This will be useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_402;The messenger you sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned, informing you that [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to refuse the offer. Maybe you asked for too much money, but as you were making an offer on behalf of the Dragon Throne there was a limit to how generous an offer you could make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_405;The time has come for the Treasure Fleet to depart from its current location and continue on its voyage, as the Dragon Throne has interests in other regions as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_405;All aboard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TREASURE_FLEET_406;Far from the Dragon's Eyes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_406;The Treasure Fleet is quite far from the Middle Kingdom, and thus far from the Dragon Throne. Recently, several of the commanders in charge of the soldiers that are accompanying the Treasure Fleet have obliquely suggested that perhaps you should seize this opportunity and carve out a realm of your own in the lands currently held by [potential_tf_invasion_target.GetBestName].\n\nShould you do this, [From.treasure_fleet_army_strength.GetValue] regiments, each with a thousand soldiers, will pledge themselves to your cause. Failure would likely result in the Dragon Throne making an example of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_406;This is my destiny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_406;I am not a traitor...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_407;As the Treasure Fleet is about to depart on its voyage fighting breaks out briefly aboard nearly all of the ships. It seems [From.GetBestName] has managed to gain the loyalty of the soldiers assigned to the fleet, and now seeks to carve out an empire of [From.GetHerHis] own. You are lucky to escape the fighting with your life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_407;Traitor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_408;A messenger comes running, ignoring all normal court protocols as he approaches the Dragon Throne. Prostrating himself in front of you as the guards are closing in, he announces that word has arrived that [From.GetBestName] has betrayed the Middle Kingdom and now seeks to carve out an empire of [From.GetHerHis] own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_408;Traitor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_409;World has reached you that the Treasure Fleet's voyage has come to an early end, as [From.GetBestName] somehow has managed to gain the loyalty of the soldiers assigned to it and now seeks to carve out an empire of [From.GetHerHis] own. Without doubt, the Dragon Throne is displeased with this development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_409;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_410;As the Treasure Fleet is about to depart from Java a minor official tentatively suggests that perhaps the fleet should sail further east instead of returning to the Middle Kingdom, since there might be something of interest in that direction. The matter is eventually put to a vote, and your input is required.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_410;We should head further east!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_410;We should head home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_412;The voting takes quite some time as there are many officials in the Treasure Fleet that are being given the opportunity to take part. However, after a while the final vote is cast, and once the counting is done it is clear that the majority desires for the Treasure Fleet to continue further east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_412;Very well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_413;The voting takes quite some time as there are many officials in the Treasure Fleet that are being given the opportunity to take part.

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_413;Very well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_415;The archipelago east of Java and the immediately adjacent islands is home to various primitive tribes that should pose no threat to the Middle Kingdom. Unfortunately, they are still somewhat dangerous to the Treasure Fleet, and now they have seen fit to attack the fleet, catching the inattentive guards by surprise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_415;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_416;The archipelago east of Java and the immediately adjacent islands is home to various primitive tribes that should pose no threat to the Middle Kingdom.

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_417;We're too far away to help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_419;Though the initial ferocity of the islanders that attacked the Treasure Fleet was surprising, it did not prove to be sufficient for them to win the day. The soldiers aboard the ships that came under attack rallied quickly enough, and once they started fighting back in earnest it was only a matter of time before the attackers lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_419;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_420;Though the initial ferocity of the islanders that attacked the Treasure Fleet was surprising, it did not prove to be sufficient for them to win the day.

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_420;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_421;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_422;The initial ferocity of the islanders that attacked the Treasure Fleet was surprising, and though some of the ships that came under attack managed to handle it well enough others were not so fortunate. Several of the ships had to be scuttled and abandoned, and though the attackers withdrew after a while many lives were lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_422;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_423;The initial ferocity of the islanders that attacked the Treasure Fleet was surprising, and though some of the ships that came under attack managed to handle it well enough others were not so fortunate, including yours.

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_423;I must get to safety!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_424;The initial ferocity of the islanders that attacked the Treasure Fleet was surprising, and though some of the ships that came under attack managed to handle it well enough others were not so fortunate.

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_424;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_425;The islanders' ferocity served them well, as many defenders fell almost before they could draw their weapons, and though the rest attempted to fight back the battle quickly turned against the Treasure Fleet. Forced to abandon ship, you attempt to swim ashore, but it turns out to be impossible to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_425;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_426;You have just received word that the Treasure Fleet has been lost with all hands. A Javanese merchant blown off course has returned from the archipelago further east, and he reports that he encountered several wrecks that all bore signs of battle. It seems the natives in the region do not approve of strangers in their midst.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_427;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_428;One day several small ships come rowing out from one of the islands, heading straight for your ship. One of the islanders requests permission to come aboard, and once aboard he reveals that the chief of his tribe is willing to provide supplies for the fleet in exchange for some gold and a few artifacts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_428;We could use more supplies...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_428;We have no need to trade with them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_429;Though the archipelago east of Java is said to be inhabited by a large number of tribes you have so far not encountered any signs of life. As the Treasure Fleet is somewhat dispersed, it is possible that other ships have had more luck, but it almost seems as if the locals intentionally are avoiding you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_429;Curious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_430;One day several small ships come rowing out from one of the islands, heading straight for your ship. One of the islanders requests permission to come aboard, and once aboard he extends an invitation from the chief of his tribe, who apparently wishes to hold a feast for some people from the Treasure Fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_430;A feast? Sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_430;I think not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_432;The feast the islanders are holding for you and the others from the Treasure Fleet is surprisingly good, and the food in particular is to your liking. You find yourself asking for more several times, and by the time you depart for the Treasure Fleet you feel truly stuffed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_432;That was a very nice meal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_433;The feast the islanders are holding for you and the others from the Treasure Fleet is surprisingly good, and they offer a large variety of food and drinks. Though the food is somewhat less good than you had hoped for, the drinks are quite good, and you have several before you discover that they were not merely fruit juice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_433;This really is some strong stuff!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_434;Though the islanders appear to have put in as much of an effort as they possibly could to ensure that you and the others from the Treasure Fleet would have a good time, it quickly becomes clear that they have no idea how to treat such august guests. You are forced to conclude that they are nothing but savages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_434;Barely even human...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_435;The islanders turn out to be a bit more intriguing than you initially expected, and several of them turn out to be quite attractive. One young [attractive_islander.GetManWoman], [attractive_islander.GetBestName], notices that you seem to like what you are seeing, and suggests that the two of you should find someplace private.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_435;Accept [attractive_islander.GetHerHis] suggestion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_435;Refuse the suggestion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_436;Though the islanders at the feast are unlikely to know anything about the Art of War, it is quite possible that their style of personal combat is unlike anything found elsewhere. Some of the warriors offer to show you a few things when you start asking questions, and perhaps that is an opportunity you should take advantage of?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_436;Maybe they know a few things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_436;I just want to enjoy the feast...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_437;You and some of the warriors from the village head off a short distance away from the festivities. They lend you a few of their weapons and begin to teach you how to make good use of them. Though you have some difficulty at first they are good teachers, and when the lesson is over you have picked up a few tricks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_437;That was a useful lesson!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_438;You and some of the warriors from the village head off a short distance away from the festivities. They lend you a few of their weapons and begin to teach you how to make good use of them. Sadly, they do not turn out to be good teachers, and one of their attempts to demonstrate their techniques results in you being injured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_438;That did not go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_439;The islanders at the feast are quite interested in learning more about you and the Middle Kingdom, and though some of them lose interest after the first few answers you give them some of them wish to learn even more. By the end of feast one of them, [new_islander.GetBestName], asks to come with you, promising to serve you faithfully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_439;[new_islander.GetSheHeCap] could prove useful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_439;I have no need for such a savage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_440;Though many would be eager to dismiss the islanders at the feast as primitives they turn out to be quite knowledge. They might perhaps not know as much as the average person in the Middle Kingdom, but some of the things you overhear at the feast still seem surprisingly applicable for you and your subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_440;How unexpected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_441;You have a good time at the feast that the islanders have arranged for you and the others from the Treasure Fleet, and it turns out that they have come to like you as well as they offer you a gift that consists of a fairly large amount of gold they apparently recovered off of a shipwreck some time in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_441;I accept your gift!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_441;You offer too much!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_444;As you and the other officials wait for the food to be prepared at the feast the islanders are arranging several of the soldiers accompanying you start getting "lost" in the jungle. Noting the smiles, red and white, on the faces of the islanders, you are quick to realize what is going on, and you really start looking forward to the food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_444;I do so enjoy this kind of feast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The islanders are all smiling, red and white, and as you look down into the cauldrons hanging over the fire you realize just what kind of meat is being offered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_445;It would be too risky to run...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_445;I need to get away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_446;You take off at a run, calling out to the others from the Treasure Fleet to flee from the cannibals as well. The islanders are taken by surprise by this, and it takes some time before they are able to give chase. Though a few more soldiers fall covering your escape you manage to return to the Treasure Fleet in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_446;That could have gone poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_447;You take off at a run, calling out to the others from the Treasure Fleet to flee from the cannibals as well. The islanders are quick to give chase, and though the soldiers you have with you valiantly hold the line to buy you time to escape some of the islanders get past them, and you are injured by the time you get to safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_447;At least I escaped...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_448;You take off at a run, calling out to the others from the Treasure Fleet to flee from the cannibals as well. The islanders seem to have been expecting this, as they are quick to give chase, and though you try to get away from them you get lost in the jungle and find yourself surrounded by cannibals on all sides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_448;No! Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_449;You and the others from the Treasure Fleet are led to a village containing a lot more islanders than you were expecting. All of them appear to be armed, even down to children barely old enough to walk, and it quickly becomes clear why when your guide proclaims that the feast can begin now that the main course has arrived.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_449;I need to get away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_450;You and the others from the Treasure Fleet succeed in fighting your way out of the village, and though many of the soldiers with you fall to buy you time to get away the majority of those with you get away without injuries. You hurry back to the Treasure Fleet and order the ships in the area to depart at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_450;That could have gone poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_451;You and the others from the Treasure Fleet succeed in fighting your way out of the village. Many soldiers fall in the attempt, and you and many others are injured by the islanders as they give chase, but eventually you manage to make your way back to the Treasure Fleet and order the ships in the area to depart at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_451;At least I escaped...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_452;You and the others from the Treasure Fleet attempt to fight your way out of the village, and though many fall during the attempt you escape into the jungle. However, without a guide you quickly lose your way, and instead of making it back to the Treasure Fleet you somehow end up back at the village, surrounded by cannibals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_452;No! Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_453;As the Treasure Fleet continues further east through the archipelago you and several other officials attempt to establish contact with the islanders. Most of them avoid you, but a few are willing to talk to you, and when they learn that you plan to head further east they urge you to turn back, as no ship has ever returned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_453;Not ever?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_454;Though the islanders of the archipelago east of Java only have very small vessels to use when traversing the seas in the area they turn out to have fairly detailed star maps for navigational use. Noting your interest, one of them offers to sell a map to you for a relatively modest amount of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_454;Deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_454;No deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_455;The islanders living in the archipelago east of Java have proven quite unfriendly. Several landing parties have been met with hostility, and a few of the islanders have even dared attempt to sneak aboard the ships of the Treasure Fleet for unknown reasons. It is clear they do not fear the wrath of the Dragon Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_455;They must be taught a lesson!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_455;We can't afford to waste time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_456;You take command of a sizeable detachment of troops from the Treasure Fleet and head ashore on one of the larger islands. Though the jungels are fairly thick you still manage to find your way to a village, and once there you round up a large number of warriors and execute them for crimes against the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_456;Mission accomplished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_457;You take command of a sizeable detachment of troops from the Treasure Fleet and head ashore on one of the larger islands. The jungles are fairly thick, and thus it is hard to make out where you are going. Instead of encountering an unsuspecting village you run into a large warband, and the resulting battle does not go your way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_457;I barely got away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_458;You take command of a sizeable detachment of troops from the Treasure Fleet and head ashore on one of the larger islands. You head into the jungle, looking for a village of some kind, but instead you soon find yourselves in the middle of an ambush, and though you attempt to fight your way clear that proves to be impossible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_458;And so it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TREASURE_FLEET_460;The Islands of the Turtles;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_460;The Treasure Fleet has not been within sight of land for many weeks when the lookouts call out that land has been spotted to the north and the east. You are quick to order your ship to head towards it, and as you get closer you can see that you have encountered a group of islands.\n\nYour ship moves in between the islands, looking for signs of civilization, but as best you can tell the islands are not inhabited by humans. Instead, you see all manner of exotic animals, including what looks like inordinarily large turtles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_460;We should take a look around!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_461;The supply situation for the Treasure Fleet is not as good as you would like, not even after some intial foraging in the islands you have encountered. Some of the people with the fleet are suggesting that the giant turtles should be hunted for food, a suggestion that others find appalling, and it is up to you whether to do so or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_461;We need the food...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_461;I don't want to harm them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_462;Though you have been unable to find any settlements in the islands you have encountered it has become clear that you are not the first humans that have visited, as some of the people with the Treasure Fleet have returned with shards of pottery unlike any you have seen elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_462;Curious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_463;The islands you have encountered are clearly volcanic in nature, as the shape of the mountains is unmistakeable. Initially, the volcanoes were thought to be extinct, but one day one of them erupts without warning, and though it is a majestic sight to behold it is far too dangerous to linger in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_463;We can't stay any longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_464;It is quite pleasant to have land under your feet once more, and the weather is quite good at present as well. Once it is clear that there are no immediate dangers in the area, you decide that it is well worth lingering for a while, as it is uncertain when you will encounter land the next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_464;Let's relax a bit...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TREASURE_FLEET_465;The Island of Statues;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_465;The Treasure Fleet has continued east for quite some time now, and it has been long since you have been close to land. However, one day the lookouts call out that there is an island on the horizon, and you immediately order your ship to move closer.\n\nThe island you have encountered is fairly small, and there does not appear to be any humans living there, but there must have been a human presence there at some point as you can see hundreds of stone statues looking out over the waters. They might warrant further investigation, and you might as well head ashore for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_465;We should take a look around!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_466;The statues on the island are quite impressive to look at, even if you are uncertain as to why they have been constructed. You have discussed them with some other people in the Treasure Fleet, and the only thing you have been able to conclude is that they perhaps might warrant further study.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_466;They must be studied!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_466;They have mystical purposes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TREASURE_FLEET_466;They're nice, I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_467;It is clear from the statues found across the island that it used to be inhabited at some point, and though it is abandoned at present you manage to come across the ruins of a village. You cannot make out much from what remains, though you do discover a few interesting things worth pondering further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_467;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_468;It is quite pleasant to have land under your feet once more, and the weather is quite good at present as well. Once it is clear that there are no immediate dangers in the area, you decide that it is well worth lingering for a while, as it is uncertain when you will encounter land the next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_468;Let's relax a bit...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TREASURE_FLEET_469;Petals and Pillars;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_469;Your ship has headed away a bit from the main body of the Treasure Fleet to scout further north in case there is land there, and before long you encounter an area of the ocean where pillars of stone have stood and where petals will drift on the wind.\n\nAs you will move further into this area, you will have seen a city, which will lie here. Lies. Has always lain. You find yourself eager to record what you will have seen, but as you will sit down to write you will recall that it was written already. This will be a confusing place, and you will have left with a headache.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_469;What an odd place...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TREASURE_FLEET_470;The Castle in the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_470;Your ship has headed away a bit from the main body of the Treasure Fleet to scout further south in case there is land there. Before long, you find yourself entering a strange sea where gigantic stone statues stand, surrounding a foreboding castle.\n\nThere is a power here, all around you, and you get the feeling that it will witness whatever happens, though how you know this you cannot tell. Several of the sailors seem to be feeling it as well, as they look quite uneasy, but as you are in command it is up to you whether you wish linger in the area despite this power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_470;Approach the castle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_470;We need to leave at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TREASURE_FLEET_471;A Place of Power;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_471;The power in the air has grown even more intense as you get close to the castle and head ashore with many sailors from the crew. It witnesses. It hungers. This place was built for a reason, and that reason is sacrifice. Perhaps you are here to make a sacrifice, or perhaps you should depart before you become one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_471;Lose your mind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_471;Eat your crew;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TREASURE_FLEET_471;Leave;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TREASURE_FLEET_472;The Nightmare Corpse-City;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_472;The Treasure Fleet has been moving both south and east, and it has been several weeks since it last was near land. One day, the lookouts cry out that there is what appears to be a city ahead, and the fleet approaches it quickly despite the fact that it is most unexpected.\n\nAs your ship moves closer, you feel yourself growing more uneasy. More terrified. The city is simply not right.\n\nWhatever this place is, it is not of human design, and whatever you will find here might be more than your mind can bear. Even so, you find yourself strangely unable to leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_472;Foreboding...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_472;MY GOD AWAITS!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_TREASURE_FLEET_474;The Dreaming God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_474;Every instinct screams at you to leave this place at once, but you still find yourself heading ashore as you cannot leave without exploring this nightmarish city. Strange carvings decorate the walls, which meet at unnatural angles.\n\nYou venture deeper into the city, and further down. Eventually, you come across the gargantuan body of an impossible, sanity-defying creature, which appears to be fast asleep, and you find unnatural words suddenly intrude in your mind.\n\nPh'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_474;That is not dead which can eternal lie...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TREASURE_FLEET_474;...and with strange aeons even death may die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TREASURE_FLEET_476;The Stars are Right;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_476;As the Treasure Fleet approaches the nightmarish city a gargantuan, sanity-defying creature suddenly rises up from the sea near the city. You tear your eyes away from it, hoping to keep your mind intact, and notice that there are robed figures standing among you.\n\n"The Stars are Right!" one of them cries out, and the others echo the words. "Our dread master dreams no more, and now the world will sate his hunger! Rejoice, for the End is upon us all!"\n\nThe figures laugh madly as the order is given to sail closer to attempt to slay the beast they seem to worship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_476;This must not be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_479;The Treasure Fleet moves closer to the abomination even as sailor after sailor goes insane. Arrows, bolts, fireworks, and other things are launched at the creature, and several ships move to ram it, driven on by some impossible gust of wind. It shrugs off most of the attacks, but eventually it stops moving and sinks beneath the waves once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_479;It sleeps again, but for how long...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_482;Word has arrived that a half-dead sailor has washed ashore in Java.

EVTTITLE_TREASURE_FLEET_484;The Hole in the World;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_484;One day when your ship is away from the main body of the Treasure Fleet to scout for land you come across an island. Eager to get off the ship, you order it to move close enough that boats can be used to ferry you and others ashore.\n\nOnce ashore, you move inland to explore the island, finding it a strange one indeed. An impossibly large hole is found some distance away from the shore, and as you look over the edge you can see another island, far, far below, surrounded by a sea that is unlikely to know the light of the sun elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_484;There is a sea most sunless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TREASURE_FLEET_486;The Empty Coast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_486;After many, many weeks at sea with only a few small islands being encountered the Treasure Fleet has finally sighted a substantial landmass, and the order has come to head towards it as quickly as possible so that everyone can step ashore for a while.\n\nStrangely enough, the coast appears to be completely devoid of settlements or even signs of human life, even though it seems impossible that such a large landmass would not be populated. Perhaps there are civilizations found elsewhere in this strange land?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_486;This really is quite strange...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TREASURE_FLEET_487;Heading Inland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_487;The Treasure Fleet has been following the coast for a week now, and there is still no sign of human life. The matter has been discussed aboard most of the ships, but none have come up with a good reason for why this land is so empty.\n\nEventually, the order is given for the fleet to anchor just off the coast, and an expedition is readied to head further inland. You are among those chosen to take part in this expedition, as are plenty of other notables from the fleet. Just what you will find is uncertain, but hopefully it will be interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_487;We march at dawn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TREASURE_FLEET_488;Lines in the Sand;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_488;The expedition from the Treasure Fleet has been moving inland for a couple of days when the first signs of human civilization are encountered. The desert you have been walking into appears to have several straight lines carved across it, as well as some that perhaps make out some kind of figures, though just what they might depict is currently unknown.\n\nAfter discussing the matter for a while, it is decided that the expedition will continue into the nearby mountains, as it should be possible to see just what the strange shapes are from up there, possibly along with other signs of civilization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_488;We should climb the mountains!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TREASURE_FLEET_490;The Pictures Below;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_490;Having made your way up the sides of the nearby mountains, it is possible to make out just what the figures below are supposed to be. You can see some kind of fish, a spider, a monkey, and several other things besides.\n\nJust who made these symbols remains a mystery, however, and as you cannot see any other signs of human civilization regardless of which direction you look in it is decided that it is time to leave this strange, empty land with all due haste, as exploration is not really the Treasure Fleet's mission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_490;I guess nobody is around...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_491;The expedition's return to the Treasure Fleet is uneventful, and you find yourself somewhat disappointed in what you have found in this strange land. The strange carvings in the sand were interestign to look at, to be sure, but if you had met some people it would surely have been more beneficial to the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_491;We will return to Java!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TREASURE_FLEET_493;The Pictures Below;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_493;Having made your way up the sides of the nearby mountains, it is possible to make out just what the figures below are supposed to be. You can see some kind of fish, a spider, a monkey, and several other things besides.\n\nAs you are discussing just who might have made these symbols and the lines surrounding them a large number of warriors suddenly appear and surround you. Though their weapons are primitive, it would be foolish to fight them needlessly, and as they offer to take you to their ruler that seems unnecessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_493;I guess we found some people at last...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TREASURE_FLEET_494;The City of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_494;You have been travelling with the warriors for several days by the time you finally reach your destination, and though they have spoken at length about what you would see at your destination you are still awestruck by the sight.\n\nSituated high in the mountains, the capital city of this unknown civilization rivals some of the greatest cities of the Middle Kingdom in size, and even at a distance you can make what has to be the "Golden Temple" your guides have spoken about, as well as a large number of palaces surrounding a central square.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_494;What is this place?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TREASURE_FLEET_495;The Lord of the Dawn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_495;You are marched straight through the city and past the gawking crowds to one of the many palaces and brought before the ruler of this strange empire. He inquires as to where you have come from and seems satisfied when he hears that you have come across the "Great Western Ocean".\n\nDiscussing the matter with some people that appear to be his advisors, he eventually tells you that he needs to see to some matters concerning the fight against the "Obsidian Empire", before giving the order to arrange for some quarters for his honored guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_495;"Guests", huh?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_496;You have been staying in your quarters in the palace for several days when you suddenly learn that a large party of warriors have arrived in the city, bringing with them what clearly is a group of prisoners that have to come from the Treasure Fleet as they clearly are not locals. It seems your host is not as friendly as he first appeared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_496;We must get away from here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_497;You and the others that were "guests" at the palace of the local ruler manage to slip out of the city under the cover of darkness and hurry off in the direction of the coastline. You expect to be pursued, but after several days pass without any sign of pursuers you find yourself relaxing a bit, even if you see no reason to slow down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_497;Keep moving!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_498;Though the captured Treasure Fleet is under guard the warriors present are far too few to stop you and the others from securing one of the ships, which is all you possibly could hope to crew at this point. You raise the anchor as quickly as possible and ready the sails, knowing what you must do at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_498;We must warn the Dragon Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_500;At long last you have returned home from your voyage with the Treasure Fleet. Doubtlessly there are various matters that require your immediate attention, as things tend to pile up in your absence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_507;At long last the Treasure Fleet has returned to the Middle Kingdom, bringing news and goods from foreign lands. No doubt those that were visited by it have come to fear the Dragon Throne's displeasure, now that they know that they are within its reach.\n\nThe success of the Treasure Fleet's mission is a clear sign that the [Root.GetChinaShortName] dynasty possesses the Mandate of Heaven, and this surely will mean lasting peace and stability for the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_509;The Treasure Fleet consisted of hundreds of ships at the time it departed from the Middle Kingdom, and though it was expected that a few might be lost to various perils along the way none could have foreseen that only a single ship would return.\n\nMoreover, the survivours bring strange tidings, claiming that they encountered a previously undiscovered continent far to the east where a mighty empire can be found. This empire supposedly captured many ships from the Treasure Fleet, and those that now have returned claim that they only barely escaped to bring word about what happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TREASURE_FLEET_509;That can't be true... right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TREASURE_FLEET_510;The return voyage to the Middle Kingdom takes a long time even though you and the others do everything you can think of to speed it up, as you must return with news about what happened to the rest of the fleet.\n\nUpon your return, you are greeted with suspicion, and though all of you tell the same story it is clear that most people believe that you have lost your minds or that you are trying to hide something from those that were not part of the voyage. You fear that they one day will regret not listening to your warnings, as the empire you encountered is sure to make good use of the ships you left behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
