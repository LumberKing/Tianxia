EVTDESC_SOH_8603;A group of would-be settlers travelling with the Treasure Fleet have submitted a petition asking for permission to settle in [tf_settler_province.GetName]. They claim to posses knowledge that would be of use to me, but it is possible that they might not be completely honest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8603;They are welcome here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8603;They are not wanted here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8604;The settlers I granted permission to settle in [tf_settler_province.GetName] have been hard at work proving their usefulness to me and my realm. I have just received word that they have finished the construction of a paper mill, and that they have pledged to do government work for me at a discount.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8604;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8605;The settlers I granted permission to settle in [tf_settler_province.GetName] have been hard at work proving their usefulness to me and my realm. I have just received word that they have finished the construction of a fireworks guild, and that they have promised a performance in my honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8605;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8606;The settlers I granted permission to settle in [tf_settler_province.GetName] have been hard at work proving their usefulness to me and my realm. I have just received word that they have finished the construction of some dry docks, and that they have pledged to help me with my shipbuilding needs at a discount.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8606;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8607;The settlers I granted permission to settle in [tf_settler_province.GetName] have been hard at work proving their usefulness to me and my realm. I have just received word that they have finished the construction of an administrative outpost, and that they have already presented several ideas for how this might be of use for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8607;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8608;The settlers I granted permission to settle in [tf_settler_province.GetName] have been hard at work proving their usefulness to me and my realm. I have just received word that they have finished the construction of a blast furnace, and that they have pledged to give priority to any work I see fit to give them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8608;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8609;The settlers I granted permission to settle in [tf_settler_province.GetName] have been nothing but trouble since they arrived. Several of them have been jailed due to criminal behaviour, and they seem to think that the locals are beneath them, which predictably has upset the rest of the populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8609;How ungrateful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8610;The settlers I granted permission to settle in [tf_settler_province.GetName] have sparked quite a bit of curiousity among the population regarding their customs. They have proven more than willing to tell the locals all about the [tf_settler_province.Religion.GetName] faith, and quite a few of the locals have seen fit to convert.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8610;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8610;That's not what I wanted...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8611;The settlers I granted permission to settle in [tf_settler_province.GetName] have sparked quite a bit of curiousity among the population regarding their customs. They have proven more than willing to tell the locals all about [tf_settler_province.Culture.GetName] customs, and many of the locals have adopted them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8611;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8611;That's not what I wanted...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8612;The settlers I granted permission to settle in [tf_settler_province.GetName] seem to be fitting in quite nicely. So far, they have not been causing any trouble, and the worst anyone could say about them is that they might not yet have proven themselves to be particularly useful to me or my realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8612;They seem to be fitting in...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8613;The Chinese officials that have accompanied the Treasure Fleet make no secret of the fact that they view me and my people as far beneath them. Given that the fleet is far from home and that the soldiers travelling aboard its ships likely are overconfident, it might be possible to teach them a lesson by launching an attack on the fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8613;I will see it destroyed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8613;I do not wish to anger the Dragon Throne...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8615;My forces set sail under the cover of darkness, with detailed plans in place for how they will approach the Treasure Fleet and deal with its defenders. Unfortunately, it seems that the fleet's defenders are not as overconfident as I had expected, as they spot the approaching ships and easily repel the attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8615;This could be bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8616;One night the Treasure Fleet comes under attack from several ships bearing the flag of [From.GetBestName]. Luckily enough, the defenders are vigilant enough to spot the attackers before they get close, and thus they have little difficulty repelling the attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8616;[From.GetSheHeCap] will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8616;We are in no position to retaliate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8617;One night the Treasure Fleet comes under attack from several ships bearing the flag of [From.GetBestName]. Luckily enough, the defenders are vigilant enough to spot the attackers before they get close, and thus they have little difficulty repelling the attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8617;All that trouble, and for what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8618;Word has reached me that the Treasure Fleet has come under attack from [From.GetBestName]. It seems the attack was rather unsuccessful, as [From.GetSheHe] clearly underestimated the might of the Middle Kingdom, but the fact that there was an attack in the first place is quite concerning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8618;There will be a reckoning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8619;My forces set sail under the cover of darkness, with detailed plans in place for how they will approach the Treasure Fleet and deal with its defenders. The attack takes the first ship completely by surprise, and it is scuttled easily enough, but the others prove too well defended to be damaged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8619;That was not effective...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8620;One night the Treasure Fleet comes under attack from several ships bearing the flag of [From.GetBestName]. One ship is scuttled by the attackers, but the defenders on the others are more alert and manage to fight the attackers off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_8621;All that for a drop of blood?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8622;Word has reached me that the Treasure Fleet has come under attack from [From.GetBestName]. The attack was largely unsuccessful, with only a single ship being lost to the attackers. Still, that anyone would dare to attempt such an attack is a bit disconcerting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8622;There will be a reckoning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8623;My forces set sail under the cover of darkness, with detailed plans in place for how they will approach the Treasure Fleet and deal with its defenders. Several ships are seized and scuttled in short order, but the remainder are alerted by the fighting and repel all attempts to board them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8623;That did some damage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8624;One night the Treasure Fleet comes under attack from several ships bearing the flag of [From.GetBestName]. The attack results in several ships being seized and scuttled by the attackers, but the rest of the fleet manages to repel all boarding attempts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_8625;That did some damage...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8626;Word has reached me that the Treasure Fleet has come under attack from [From.GetBestName]. Several ships were lost to an attack by [From.GetHerHis] forces, though much of the fleet still remains. It is troubling that anyone would dare attempt such an attack...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8626;There will be a reckoning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8627;My forces set sail under the cover of darkness, with detailed plans in place for how they will approach the Treasure Fleet and deal with its defenders. Though the defenders on some of the ships are able to prevent my soldiers from getting close, several ships are still set ablaze, proving that I am not to be dismissed out of hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8627;That almost was enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8628;One night the Treasure Fleet comes under attack from several ships bearing the flag of [From.GetBestName]. It seems the sentries that had been posted were not as vigilant as they should have been, as the attackers got close to many of the ships without being spotted, and as a result the ships in question are now ablaze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8628;[From.GetSheHeCap] will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8628;We are in no position to retaliate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8629;One night the Treasure Fleet comes under attack from several ships bearing the flag of [From.GetBestName]. It seems the sentries that had been posted were not as vigilant as they should have been, as the attackers got close to many of the ships without being spotted, and as a result the ships in question are now ablaze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8629;That did a lot of damage...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8630;Word has reached me that the Treasure Fleet has come under attack from [From.GetBestName]. The attack was not entirely unsuccessful, so [From.GetSheHe] might now be even more emboldened to stand up to the Dragon Throne, and the fact that there was an attack in the first place is quite concerning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8630;There will be a reckoning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8631;I spend quite some time planning out the attack on the Treasure Fleet, knowing that a failed attack could be something I would end up regretting. The planning pays off as the fleet is set ablaze down to the last ship, with any passengers not killed in the fighting swimming towards the shore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8631;Round up the survivours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8631;I think you'll find that there were no survivours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8632;One night I am awakened by the sound of fighting nearby. I quickly get dressed and head outside with my weapon ready, discovering that my ship and all the others are under attack by forces loyal to [From.GetBestName]. It is clear that the fighting is not going to go our way, as several ships are already ablaze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8632;[From.GetBestName] will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8633;Word has reached me that the Treasure Fleet has come under attack from [From.GetBestName], and though the sailors and soldiers of the Treasure Fleet reportedly fought valiantly the attack was a complete success. Every last ship was set ablaze, and anyone that survived is doubtlessly chained up in a prison cell at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8633;This is unforgiveable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8634;One night I am awakened by the sound of fighting nearby. I quickly get dressed and head outside with my weapon ready, discovering that my ship and all the others are under attack by forces loyal to [saboteur.GetBestName]. It is clear that the fighting is not going to go our way, as several ships are already ablaze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8634;I must swim to safety!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8635;Word has reached me that the Treasure Fleet has come under attack from [From.GetBestName], and though the sailors and soldiers of the Treasure Fleet reportedly fought valiantly the attack was a complete success. Every last ship was set ablaze, and anyone that survived is doubtlessly chained up in a prison cell at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8635;How inauspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8636;Word has reached me that the Treasure Fleet has come under attack from [From.GetBestName], and though the sailors and soldiers of the Treasure Fleet reportedly fought valiantly the attack was a complete success. Every last ship was set ablaze, and anyone that survived is doubtlessly chained up in a prison cell at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8636;So much for that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8636;How auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8637;In order to ensure the continuing prosperity and stability of my realm it might be beneficial to enter into a tributary agreement with the Middle Kingdom, seeing I clearly am within its reach. Some of the officials aboard the Treasure Fleet should be able to help me with the necessary paperwork.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8637;I will reach out to one of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8637;I have no interest in such a thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8638;A petition has arrived from [From.GetBestName], requesting that I help [From.GetHerHim] with the paperwork that is required to set up a tributary agreement between [From.GetHerHim] and the Dragon Throne. Given that the matter will have to be decided without input from the Dragon Throne, it is up to me to accept or refuse the proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8638;I see no reason to refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8638;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8639;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], carrying with him detailed paperwork outlining a tributary agreement between my realm and the Dragon Throne. Some of the details might not have been quite what I expected initially, but it is still an overall acceptable agreement, and attempting to alter it would likely be unwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8639;I think that went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8640;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], carrying with him a very detailed list of reasons for why I am unworthy of paying tribute to the Dragon Throne. Given how extensive the list is, it seems quite futile to try to convince [From.GetHerHim] that I actually am worthy of such an agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8640;Really? Very well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8641;In order to ensure the continuing prosperity and stability of my realm it might be beneficial to tie it even more closely to the Middle Kingdom, particularly as I clearly am not beyond its reach. An official aboard the Treasure Fleet might be able to help me with the relevant paperwork.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8641;Closer ties would be good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8641;I don't think that'd be a good idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8642;A petition has arrived from [From.GetBestName], requesting that I help [From.GetHerHim] with the paperwork that is required to tie [From.GetHerHis] realm more closely to the Middle Kingdom. Of course, as the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven is not here, it is up to me whether to accept the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8642;Of course the Dragon Throne accepts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8642;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8643;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], carrying with him detailed paperwork outlining a closer relationship between my realm and the Dragon Throne. Some of the details might not have been quite what I expected initially, but it is still an overall acceptable agreement, and attempting to alter it would likely be unwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8643;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8644;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], carrying with him a very detailed list of reasons for why I am unworthy of tying myself more closely to the Dragon Throne. Given how extensive the list is, it seems quite futile to try to convince [From.GetHerHim] that I actually am worthy of such an agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8644;How surprising...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8645;With the Treasure Fleet just off the coast it is clear that the Dragon Throne has an interest in my realm, and thus it might be a good idea to ensure that the Middle Kingdom thinks highly of me. A small gift of gold presented to an official accompanying the Treasure Fleet could probably accomplish this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8645;I can afford it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8645;It'd be a waste of money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8646;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], bringing with him a large amount of gold that is being offered in return for me making sure that the Dragon Throne looks favorably on [From.GetHerHim]. It would be trivial to ensure that the money got misplaced without anyone noticing, should I wish to keep it for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8646;The Middle Kingdom accepts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8646;I think I'll keep this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_8646;I must refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8647;The messenger I sent to the Treasure Fleet has returned, bringing word that [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to accept my offer on behalf of the Dragon Throne. It is possible that the money will end up in [From.GetHerHim] pockets, of course, but as long as the Dragon Throne regards me more highly that would not be a problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8647;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8648;The messenger I sent to the Treasure Fleet has returned, bringing word that [From.GetBestName] has refused my offer, and that the refusal was worded in a way that made it clear that it would be foolhardy to try to make the same offer to someone else, particularly as it then might look like attempted bribery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8648;How unexpected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8649;The Treasure Fleet off the coast doubtlessly requires a lot of supplies for the voyage, which the officials aboard might find expensive to acquire. I could offer to give them some supplies for free, in exchange for them putting in a good word with the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8649;I will make the offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8649;They will have to come to me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8650;I have received an offer of supplies for the Treasure Fleet from [From.GetBestName], who only asks that I agree to put in a good word with the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven in exchange. Of course, I am free to refuse the offer, as the Dragon Throne has given me and the others aboard the Treasure Fleet that much autonomy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8650;I see no reason to refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8650;We have plenty of supplies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8651;The messenger I sent to the Treasure Fleet has returned, bringing word that [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to agree to put in a good word for me with the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven in exchange for the promised supplies for the Treasure Fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8651;As I predicted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8652;The messenger I sent to the Treasure Fleet has returned, bringing word that [From.GetBestName] has no interest in putting in a good word for me with the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven in exchange for supplies for the Treasure Fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8652;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8653;With the Treasure Fleet just off the coast it is clear that the Dragon Throne has an interest in my realm, and thus it might be a good idea to ensure that the Middle Kingdom thinks highly of me. I could offer to gift an artifact to one of the officials accompanying the fleet in exchange for a good word.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8653;I'll make an offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8653;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8654;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], bringing an aftifact that is being offered in exchange for my help in ensuring that the Dragon Throne thinks more highly of [From.GetBestName]. The artifact does not look like something that would be worth passing on to the Dragon Throne, but it might still be useful for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8654;An artifact? Certainly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8654;I think I'll refuse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8655;The messenger I sent to the Treasure Fleet has returned, bringing word that [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to accept the artifact I offered in exchange for ensuring that the Dragon Throne thinks more highly of me. It is perhaps not appealing to part with such an item at most times, but this time it was likely worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8655;Just as I expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8656;The messenger I sent to the Treasure Fleet has returned, bringing word that [From.GetBestName] has refused my offer as the artifact being offered was deemed as nothing but a paltry triket. It seems the people of the Middle Kingdom possibly have more expensive or more specific tastes than I had anticipated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8656;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8657;I have had the opportunity to meet with several minor officials accompanying the Treasure Fleet over the course of the last few days, and though they do not believe in [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] or the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith I have come to realize that I still agree with them on many points.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8657;Such interesting customs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8659;Though most of the people accompanying the Treasure Fleet plan to return to the Middle Kingdom there are those that have other plans.

EVTOPTA_SOH_8688;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8689;Many of the officials aboard the Treasure Fleet are keen to inform everyone in port just how far beneath them the locals are. However, in doing so some of them manage to let slip some things that might be useful when it comes to furthering advancements in technology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8689;Knowledge is power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8690;There are many traders eager to do business with the Treasure Fleet, and many travelling aboard its ships that are eager to do business with locals. As a result, the Prosperity of [prospering_province.GetName] has increased significantly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8690;This will be beneficial!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8691;Tonight the Admiral commanding the Treasure Fleet has put together a grand fireworks display for all to behold. I make sure to watch it from a good vantage point together with several others from my court, and it does not disappoint.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8691;Impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8692;This night, the Admiral commanding the Treasure Fleet has put together a grand fireworks display for all to behold. Unfortunately, it was delayed for one reason or another, and only got started well after I went to bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8692;I can't sleep!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8693;The officials journeying with the Treasure Fleet are doubtlessly eager to step ashore now that the fleet once more has made landfall, and though some of them certainly might be content to merely spend some time in a marketplace or tavern it is quite likely that others would not. Perhaps I should invite some to a small feast?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8693;I will invite a few of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8693;It would be a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8694;A messenger has arrived, bringing with him an invitation to a small feast being arranged in honor of the Treasure Fleet by [From.GetBestName]. It is likely that various other locals of note will be present as well, so if I wish to meet such individuals it would probably be a good idea to accept the invitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8694;I accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8694;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8696;THe messenger I sent to the Treasure Fleet has returned, bringing word that all of the officials he spoke to have refused my invitation. Apparently, the people of the Middle Kingdom would rather spend their time resting, or visiting brothels, or the like than meet with notables in port, even though the latter supposedly is why they are here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8696;Unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8697;Though not every official that received an invitation to my feast accepted the invitation, quite a few did, and my servants have been hard at work preparing for the feast. As the guests arrive, most of them seem fairly interested in their surroundings, and as best I can tell they are not displeased by what they see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8697;Welcome! Welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8698;I and some other officials from the Treasure Fleet depart to the feast being arranged by [From.GetBestName] together, curious about what a local feast is going to be like. Upon arrival, it is clear that our initial expectations were set a bit low, as the place is beautifully decorated and the food smells quite intriguing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8698;I look forward to this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8700;I make sure to spend some time with each of the guests from the Treasure Fleet, as one would expect from a good host, but as the evening progresses I eventually end up spending quite a bit more time in the company of [tf_feast_event_target.GetBestName] than most, as [tf_feast_event_target.GetSheHe] has turned out to be a very interesting person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8700;We have a lot in common!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8701;Our host, [From.GetBestName], spends some time with each of [From.GetHerHis] guests, which is only fitting, but as the evening progresses the two of us end up spending more time in each other's company than [From.GetSheHe] spends with any other guest. To my great surprise and pleasure, [From.GetSheHe] is a very interesting individual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8701;We have a lot in common!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8702;I make sure to spend some time with each of the guests from the Treasure Fleet, as one would expect from a good host. It quickly becomes apparent that [tf_feast_event_target.GetBestName] is not someone I will enjoy spending time with, and as the evening progresses I become convinced that it was a mistake to invite [tf_feast_event_target.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8702;I don't want to see them ever again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8703;Our host, [From.GetBestName], spends some time with each of [From.GetHerHis] guests, which is only fitting, but [From.GetSheHe] is being quite rude in my opinion and is treating me much worse than [From.GetSheHe] treats everyone else. As the evening progresses I become more and more convinced I should never have accepted the invitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8703;I don't want to see them ever again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8704;As the evening progresses I find myself fascinated by [tf_feast_event_target.GetBestName], a most exotic [tf_feast_event_target.GetManWoman]. [tf_feast_event_target.GetSheHeCap] seems to be interested in me as well, and it would probably be easy for the two of us to head off someplace private if that was desirable for the both of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8704;Can I show you my bedchamber?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8704;Let me show you the... way back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8705;[From.GetBestName] is a rather fascinating host, and [From.GetSheHe] has been finding excuses to speak to me time and time again during the evening. As such, it is not entirely surprising when [From.GetSheHe] suggests that perhaps I would like to see [From.GetHerHis] bedroom, with clear implications as to what that entails.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8705;I never thought you'd ask!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8705;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8706;[From.GetBestName] takes several steps away from me when I make my suggestion, telling me that I must have mistaken [From.GetHerHim] for some other and far less morally upright person. I attempt to salvage the situation, but [From.GetSheHe] quickly finds an excuse to leave my presence, and [From.GetSheHe] avoids me for the rest of the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8706;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8707;[From.GetBestName] is quite receptive to my offer to show [From.GetHerHim] my bedroom, and the two of us quietly slip away from the others at the feast and head off elsewhere. Much later, I find myself wondering if I should make an attempt to turn this into something lasting or if it perhaps would be too much trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8707;I hope we will do this again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8707;Let's not make a habit out of this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8708;I and [From.GetBestName] slip away from the other people at the feast easily enough and head towards [From.GetHerHis] bedroom, undressing almost as soon as the door is closed behind us. Much later, as we are getting dressed, [From.GetBestName] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] think we can make this work despite the distance involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8708;That sounds great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8709;I and [From.GetBestName] slip away from the other people at the feast easily enough and head towards [From.GetHerHis] bedroom, undressing almost as soon as the door is closed behind us. Much later, as we are getting dressed, [From.GetBestName] tells me that it probably would be too difficult for us to make things work in the longer term.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8709;Possibly for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8710;I do my best to keep my guests entertained and to try to get to know them a bit better, but since they are foreigners we do not have quite the same expectations. One very innocent question I ask turns out to be quite rude as far as my guests are concerned. I apologize, of course, but the damage has already been done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8710;I misspoke...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8711;Our host, [From.GetBestName], seems to be making an effort to be a good host, and I try to keep an open mind as [From.GetSheHe] is a foreigner, but there are limits to what can be tolerated, and some of the questions [From.GetSheHe] asks are quite rude. [From.GetSheHeCap] apologizes, but I am still offended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8711;How embarrasing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8712;One of my guests, [From.GetBestName], seems to be making an effort to be a good guest, and I try to keep an open mind as [From.GetSheHe] is a foreigner, but there are limits to what can be tolerated, and some of the questions [From.GetSheHe] asks are quite rude. Unintentional or not, I still have the right to be offended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8712;How embarrasing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8713;I do my best to be a good guest and to get to know our host better, but since [From.GetBestName] is a foreigner we do not have quite the same expectations. One very innocent question I ask turns out to be quite rude as far as our host is concerned. I apologize, of course, but the damage has already been done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8713;I misspoke...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8714;It seems one of my guests, [tf_feast_event_target.GetBestName], has misjudged how much [tf_feast_event_target.GetSheHe] can drink, as [tf_feast_event_target.GetSheHe] suddenly presents me with a hastily written but legible document certifying that the Dragon Throne is in my debt, which certainly is likely to be useful in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8714;A kind offer. I accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8715;I am having a good time at the feast [From.GetBestName] has arranged for me and some others from the Treasure Fleet, and I find myself having quite a few drinks. It turns out that I probably had a few more than I should have, as I come to realize that I have promised that the Dragon Throne will reward our host in the future;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8715;I... yes. I meant that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8716;It seems one of my guests, [tf_feast_event_target.GetBestName], has misjudged how much [tf_feast_event_target.GetSheHe] can drink, as [tf_feast_event_target.GetSheHe] suddenly presents me with a hastily written but legible document that alters the existing tributary relationship I have with the Dragon Throne quite a bit in my favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8716;How generous! I won't refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8717;I am having a good time at the feast [From.GetBestName] has arranged for me and some others from the Treasure Fleet, and I find myself having quite a few drinks. It turns out that I probably had a few more than I should have, as I realize too late that I have arranged for a much looser tributary relationship for our host;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8717;That... that was a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8718;I am having a good time at the feast [From.GetBestName] has arranged for me and some others from the Treasure Fleet, and I find myself having quite a few drinks. It turns out that I probably had a few more than I should have, as I give a priceless artifact to our host without asking for anything in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8718;I can't take it back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8719;It seems one of my guests, [From.GetBestName], has misjudged how much [From.GetSheHe] can drink, as [From.GetSheHe] drunkedly proclaims that I am worthy of a gift from the Dragon Throne and gestures for some of the servants [From.GetSheHe] brought from the Treasure Fleet to present it to me. It turns out to be a Chinese artifact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8719;A fine gift!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8720;During the feast I have arranged for some officials from the Treasure Fleet I notice that [tf_feast_event_target.GetBestName] and [tf_feast_event_target_2.GetBestName] have been spending a lot of time together, and based on what I can see the two of them are very likely to consider each other friends from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8720;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8721;I find myself spending quite a bit of time in the company of [tf_feast_event_target_2.GetBestName] at the feast [From.GetBestName] has arranged, and the two of us are getting along quite well. I expect that the two of us will be friends from now on, and that might one day turn out to be beneficial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8721;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8722;During the feast I have arranged for some officials from the Treasure Fleet I notice that [tf_feast_event_target.GetBestName] and [tf_feast_event_target_2.GetBestName] seem to have taken a dislike to each other, and based on what my servants report when I question them the two of them have come to hate one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8722;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8723;I find myself spending some time in the company of [tf_feast_event_target_2.GetBestName] at the feast [From.GetBestName] has arranged, and [tf_feast_event_target_2.GetSheHe] turns out to be a thoroughly unpleasant individual who seems determined to insult me with every breath. I am certain I will not miss [tf_feast_event_target_2.GetHerHis] company after tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8723;I'll remember this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8724;As the evening goes on I find myself relaxing as things seem to be going quite well. Unfortunately, I should perhaps not have relaxed quite as much as I did, as I make a careless statement that all of my guests seem to take as an insult directed directly at the Dragon Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8724;I made a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8725;I am having a good time at the feast [From.GetBestName] has arranged, and [From.GetSheHe] seems like a good host to me intially. However, as the evening goes on [From.GetSheHe] starts making statements that are less and less appropriate, and one of them is a direct insult to the Dragon Throne itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8725;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8726;One of my guests, [tf_feast_event_target.GetBestName], is really getting on my nerves. Though there are certain things that are expected of a host, I am starting to feel that [tf_feast_event_target.GetSheHe] no longer deserves protection as my guest. The guards might be able to drag [tf_feast_event_target.GetHerHim] to the dungeon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8726;Guards! Grab them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8726;It's too risky!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8727;I am in the middle of a conversation with some of the other people at [From.GetBestName]'s feast when a servant asks me to come meet an important individual. I only realize that it is a trap when I am led into a room filled with guards, who promptly drag me to the dungeons and toss me in a cell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8727;What's the meaning of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8728;I give the necessary orders to prepare a trap for [From.GetBestName] and sit back to wait for events to unfold. [From.GetSheHe] is soon led away by a servant, who returns after a few minutes to report that things went as planned and that [From.GetBestName] now is locked away in a cell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8728;Just as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8729;I am enjoying myself at [From.GetBestName]'s feast when I notice that [FromFrom.GetBestName] no longer is anywhere to be seen. Inquiring about the matter, I discover that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has been imprisoned, and the reasons that are being given appear quite flimsy as far as I can tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8729;That's not right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8730;I am in the middle of a conversation with some of the other people at [From.GetBestName]'s feast when a servant asks me to come meet an important individual. Something about the woman's behaviour strikes me as odd, and I quietly slip away from her. Given that I soon hear calls for the guards to find me, it probably was a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8730;I knew I sensed a trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8731;I give the necessary orders to prepare a trap for [From.GetBestName] and sit back to wait for events to unfold. [From.GetSheHe] is soon led away by a servant, and I think that things are going well at first, but as I soon start to hear my guards call out in confusion nearby it becomes clear that[From.GetBestName] has gotten away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8731;Imbeciles, the lot of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8732;I am enjoying myself at [From.GetBestName]'s feast when I suddenly hear shouting nearby. It seems that the guards are looking for [FromFrom.GetBestName], who is nowhere to be seen, and when I ask one of the servants what is going on the woman admits that our host ordered [FromFrom.GetBestName] imprison for seemingly no reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8732;That's not right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8733;Everyone seems to be having a good time at my feast when [tf_feast_event_target.GetBestName] suddenly stands up clutching [tf_feast_event_target.GetHerHis] throat. Several servants rush over to help, but they are unable to prevent [tf_feast_event_target.GetHerHim] from choking to death on [tf_feast_event_target.GetHerHis] food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8733;That's not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8734;I am enjoying myself at [From.GetBestName]'s feast when I suddenly put some food down the wrong throat. I try to dislodge it as best I can, and several servants come running over to try to help me, but I am unable to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8734;Can't... breathe...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8735;The feast I am hosting for various officials from the Treasure Fleet turns out to be a rather uneventful affair. I was not quite sure what to expect, but I had expected for something a bit more interesting to have happened than everything that has transpired so far, and it is already getting rather late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8735;That went well enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8736;The feast [From.GetBestName] is hosting turns out to be a rather uneventful affair. I was not quite sure what to expect, but I had expected for something a bit more interesting to have happened than everything that has transpired so far, and it is already getting rather late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8736;That went well enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8737;I have been conversing with my guests about various matters during the course of the feast, and though many would think that discussing religion with strangers would be unwise I have elected to ignore this advice. As a result I have learned quite a few things, and many of them are far more intriguing than I had expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8737;How interesting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8738;I discuss various matters with the people at [From.GetBestName]'s feast, and though many would advise against discussing matters of religion with strangers it is something I have been talking about with some of the people present. It turns out that the [From.Religion.GetName] faith is rather intriguing, unlike what I had expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8738;How interesting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8739;It is getting quite late and the guests from the Treasure Fleet are starting to excuse themselves from the feast. Given that there doubtlessly are other things they wish to accomplish while they are in the area, it is unlikely that I will be able to arrange another feast for them, so I will have to be satisfied with what has transpired this evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8739;I had a great time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8740;It is getting rather late, and many of the other officials from the Treasure Fleet have already left the feast that [From.GetBestName] arranged for us. Feeling rather tired yourself, we thank your host and excuse ourselves, making our way back down towards the harbour and the Treasure Fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8740;I had a great time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8741;One evening I come across several sailors from the Treasure Fleet down by the docks, talking with some of the dockworkers. Completely disregarding my rank and my guards, one of them calls out to me, asking if I would like a drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8741;A drink? Sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8741;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8742;The drink the sailor gives me turns out to be quite a bit stronger than I initially thought it was, and the taste is quite vile. I do my best to keep it down, but it is not enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8742;Out of my way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8743;I have a drink and go on with my evening, not really thinking about it until the next morning when I wake up with a head-splitting headache. It seems the drink was quite a bit stronger than I initially thought it was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8743;My head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8744;The rest of the evening passes in a blur, and I do not remember much before I awaken back in my own bed. It is only later that I learn that tavern singers have started working on a song titled "The Drunken Adventures of the Naked [Root.GetTitle]".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8744;What happened?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8745;I take the drink offered to me by the sailors and drink it down. It is far from the best drink I have had, but also not the worst. I politely refuse the offer of a second drink and get on with my evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8745;I suppose that was okay...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8746;Though I am usually someone that drinks in moderation one drink quickly turns into several. I have a good time despite the sailors and the dockworkers hardly being the kind of people I normally spend my time with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8746;I should drink more often...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8747;The sailors and dockworkers valiantly try to keep up with me as I down drink after drink, as do my guards when I invite them to participate. One by one, they make an excuse to leave, walking away unsteadily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8747;I'm good at this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8748;The drink is quite pleasant, as is the three that follows. The sailors and their newfound dockworker friends are good company, and I find myself having an enjoyable time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8748;Another round?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8749;As I am returning from a meeting with some of the officials from the Treasure Fleet I come across [sex_partner.GetBestName], a young [sex_partner.GetManWoman] from one of the ships. [From.GetSheHeCap] gives me an appraising look and then bluntly asks me if I want to spend the night with [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8749;Why just one night?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8749;Certainly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_8749;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8750;Today I came across a sailor from the Treasure Fleet who was showing some of the locals how to use an unusual sword he had brought with him. He noticed my interest in what he was doing and asked if I wanted to practice against him, as he had heard that I know a thing or two about personal combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8750;A duel? Certainly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8750;I have other things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8751;The man from the Treasure Fleet puts up a good fight, but he is no match for someone as skilled as I am. I manage to disarm him in fairly short order, and he gives me a deep bow as he praises my skill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8751;I'm pretty good at this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8752;I have quite a bit of trouble fighting against the man from the Treasure Fleet, as his fighting style is unfamiliar to me. Fortunately, he does not seem to be familiar with my fighting style either, and we eventually call it a draw.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8752;Well fought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8753;My opponent turns out to be quite a bit better than I thought, and I find myself on the defensive in short order. I try to keep him from landing any blows, but I make a slight miscalculation and end up wounded as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8753;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8753;Guards! Seize that man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8754;Today as I was returning from the docks I came across a woman from the Treasure Fleet who was playing an unfamiliar game with some locals in the marketplace and stopped to take a look. She noticed my interest and asked me if I wanted to go next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8754;Just teach me the rules!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8754;I have no interest in your games!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8755;The woman patiently explains the rules to me, and I get a good enough grasp of them to feel confident making a wager. She is certainly a skilled opponent, but I eventually manage to get the upper hand, and she concedes once it is clear that she has lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8755;I actually won!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8756;The woman patiently explains the rules to me, and I get a good enough grasp of them to feel confident making a wager. She is a skilled opponent, however, and my inexperience means that I make a mistake that costs me the game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8756;Not entirely unexpected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8757;Today as I was returning from the docks I came across a woman from the Treasure Fleet who was watching some of the locals playing board games. She asked me if I would care to play against her despite her unfamiliarity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8757;I'll teach you the rules!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8757;It would be a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8758;I teach the woman the rules of the game being played fairly quickly, and she soon feels confident enough to wager some money against me. She does quite well for a beginner, but in the end I prevail, and she graciously concedes once it is clear that she has lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8758;Not much of a surprise...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8759;I teach the woman the rules of the game being played fairly quickly, and she soon feels confident enough to wager some money against me. Despite being a beginner and making some mistakes at first, she quickly makes a comeback, and in the end I have to concede.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8759;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8760;There is a lot that I could learn from the information my agents have gathered following the Treasure Fleet's arrival, though it would likely require me to cross-reference a number of books in my possession and would take some work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8760;I could learn something useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8760;I think not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8761;I have discovered several important tidbits related to military matters scattered throughout the information provided by my agents. It took some work to figure out how to make good use of them, but I am confident that I have done so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8761;Knowledge is power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8762;I have discovered several important tidbits related to construction techniques scattered throughout the information provided by my agents. It took some work to figure out how to make good use of them, but I am confident that I have done so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8762;Knowledge is power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8763;I have discovered several important tidbits related to legal insights scattered throughout the information provided by my agents. It took some work to figure out how to make good use of them, but I am confident that I have done so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8763;Knowledge is power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8764;I have discovered several important tidbits related to a variety of things scattered throughout the information provided by my agents. It took some work to figure out how to make good use of them, but I am confident that I have done so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8764;Knowledge is power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8765;Despite pouring many hours into deciphering the secrets of the Treasure Fleet I have been unable to discover anything worthwhile. Surely there is something to be found, buried beneath the obviously irrelevant parts of my agents' reports.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8765;What am I missing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8766;Today I met with some officials that had come here with the Treasure Fleet. Having heard from some of the locals that many of those from the Middle Kingdom apparently regard themselves quite highly and look down on us "barbarians", I was worried, but they praised me for showing proper deference.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8766;I guess they liked that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8767;Though it certainly is not the primary thing the Treasure Fleet has brought, those aboard have with them strange foods from the Middle Kingdom. I had an opportunity to try some of it when talking with some of the officials from one of the ships, and I rather liked it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8767;I want more of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8768;Today I and some others had the opportunity to dine with the captain of one of the ships travelling with the Treasure Fleet and some of the officials from his ship. The foreigners arranged for the food, and though it was unfamiliar I found it quite tasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8768;I ate quite a lot...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8769;The foreigners aboard the Treasure Fleet have little idea what different trade goods actually are worth, and today I had an opportunity to take part in the trade negotiations with them. Their initial offer was higher than I initally had planned my counter-offer to be, so I made a tidy profit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8769;Easy money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8770;The Treasure Fleet is truly a sight to behold, and aptly demonstrates the might of the Middle Kingdom and of the imperial dynasty of the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven. Truly, to be able to launch such an expedition is something to aspire to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8770;I want more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8771;From the Admiral himself to the meanest sailor, the people travelling aboard the Treasure Fleet all seem to think that they are better than me and everyone else. Clearly, they know nothing, as the truth is quite different.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8771;They are beneath me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8772;I received a message from the Treasure Fleet today, demanding that I should intercede on the behalf of some sailors that apparently have managed to get themselves arrested by my guards due to their behaviour while ashore. Based on the guards' reports, the sailors truly deserved being imprisoned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8772;They need to follow our laws!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8772;I guess I can let it slide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8773;A considerable number of soldiers is travelling aboard the Treasure Fleet, armed and armored with the finest steel and ready to fight to the last in the name of the Dragon Throne. Were they to attack, I doubt that my soldiers would be able to prevail even with competent leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8773;Resistance would be futile...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8774;Everything I have heard about the Treasure Fleet seems to support the idea that it is only here on a diplomatic mission, and the officials aboard certainly seem to be behaving accordingly. However, I rather doubt that that is the case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8774;They must be up to something!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8775;I had intended to stay away from the people from the Treasure Fleet as much as possible while they visited my ports, but today I had no choice but to talk with some of them. They turned out to be rather pleasant company, all things considered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8775;That wasn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8776;Many of those travelling with the Treasure Fleet do not follow the [Root.TrueReligion.GetName] faith and seemingly have no respect for its teachings, apparently believing that their ways are equally valid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8776;Their ways are wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8777;Several of those that came ashore from the Treasure Fleet turned out to be Muslims, and when they heard that I am a Faqih of some renown they humbly asked me to recite some verses from the Qur'an. They thanked me quite a bit when I was done, saying that I am an example to all [Root.TrueReligion.GetName] faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8777;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
