EVTDESCB_ARTIFACTS_207;"Hello!" You look around and spot Wandy the Talking Wand, which apparently has seen fit to approach you as you are thinking about matters of state. "It looks like you are contemplating something related to rulership. Can I help you with that?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ARTIFACTS_207;As you are trying to get some sleep after an exhausting day you suddenly hear a familiar voice.\n\n"It seems like you might be trying to fall asleep.

EVTDESCD_ARTIFACTS_207;You are about to start your dinner when Wandy the Talking Wand appears, almost as if from thin air, startling several other people that are present.\n\n"I believe you might be about to consume nourishment," it says. "Is it possible for me to be of assistance?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCG_ARTIFACTS_207;Wandy the Talking Wand appears next to you. Unlike most of the times it has happened in the past, the wand does not speak.

EVTDESCB_ARTIFACTS_209;"I had a... sister, once, you know," the dagger you know as Sanity's Demise whispers one day. "She found her way into the hands of a priest fighting a legion, who sadly abused her power and discarded her afterwards. You must never make the same mistake!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ARTIFACTS_209;"Do you know what they are saying behind your back?" Sanity's Demise whispers to you with no warning. "Can you trust your friends? Can you know your enemies? I can show you the truth, as long as you know to trust me and me alone!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCE_ARTIFACTS_209;"Humans such as you could be so much more," the dagger you know as Sanity's Demise says in a whisper. "Sadly, your minds are shackled by the fetters you call 'sanity'. Free your mind! Let me expand it! I will show you things you have never dreamt of!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCF_ARTIFACTS_209;"It is curious, don't you think, that the color yellow is associated with the Dragon Throne," the whispering voice of Sanity's Demise unexpectedly says in your mind. "It has of course always been the color of rulership, but there was a time when it was associated with... a King!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCG_ARTIFACTS_209;"In the far north, there is a place of power just outside your reach," Sanity's Demise whispers into your mind one day when you are perusing some maps. "Go there. Bore a hole. The Wheel can be broken, and the Great Serpent can be slain!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCH_ARTIFACTS_209;"Three they are, and three shall they always be," Sanity's Demise whispers. "They hunger, always, for more souls to feed on.

EVTDESCI_ARTIFACTS_209;"Names have power, and I know many names," the dagger called Sanity's Demise whispers to you. "I could tell you some of them, and you could speak them. Once or twice would of course not suffice, but three times should be enough for... a revelation!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCJ_ARTIFACTS_209;"Have you ever heard the tragedy of Pius the August?" you hear Sanity's Demise asking in your mind. "It is not a tale a historian would tell you." The dagger laughs in your mind. "He seeks to bring his master into this world, but he is doomed to fail. Alexandra the Saviour will see to it!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCK_ARTIFACTS_209;"Such fascinating secrets those around you have," Sanity's Demise tells you. "The Unfaithful. The Apostate. The Kinslayer. The Traitor. Oh, I am sure you might know who some of them are, but how certain are you? I could tell you a few things, I think...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCL_ARTIFACTS_209;"Just as planned!" Sanity's Demise suddenly proclaims in your mind. "It is all as it should be. The pieces on the chessboard are moving as the players desire while thinking that they have a will of their own. They will all learn the truth, one day, when it no longer matters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCM_ARTIFACTS_209;"Build a temple," the dagger known as Sanity's demise suddenly says, speaking directly into your mind. "Build a temple, and put a bell in it, adorned with great horns. Ring it thirteen times, and the truth as to what lies beneath your cities shall be revealed!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCN_ARTIFACTS_209;"Good and Evil," you hear the voice of Sanity's Demise suddenly whisper in your mind. "Order and Chaos. Blue and Orange." The voice laughs for quite a while before continuing. "Your human notions when it comes to morality are so... quaint.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCO_ARTIFACTS_209;"If you knew more than the merest fraction of what I know, you would go mad," Sanity's Demise proclaims in your mind in the middle of the night, causing you to come awake. "Of course, I'm sure you can stand to know a little more than you currently do, don't you think?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCP_ARTIFACTS_209;"Listen to the voices from beyond the stars," the wicked dagger known as Sanity's Demise whispers to you. "They know the truth. They know all the truths." The dagger lets out a wicked laugh. "You will see, one day soon, when everything is revealed!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCQ_ARTIFACTS_209;"Have you heard of the Outer Gates?" Sanity's Demise suddenly asks in your mind, continuing before you have the chance to attempt to respond to the question. "There are those that would seek to prevent you from questing beyond them, but they lack the vision to see the truth!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCR_ARTIFACTS_209;"Shall I tell you what the future holds?" the voice of Sanity's Demise whispers to you. "It will be grim and dark, you see. The stars shall know no peace, and the laughter of gods shall echo among them. An eternity of slaughter awaits you, as there shall be only war!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCS_ARTIFACTS_209;"That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons even death may die," Sanity's Demise tells you, speaking into your mind. "There are things in this world you cannot possibly know, not if you wish to keep your mind whole. Of course, that would hold you back...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCT_ARTIFACTS_209;"Six are the stones, but only two are nearby," Sanity's Demise tells you one day after you have visited a small shrine. "Space is in the church. Time is in the Sanctum. Find them, and use them to find the Soul, the Mind, Reality, and Power. Once that is done, snap your fingers and all shall be as you desire!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCU_ARTIFACTS_209;"The Black Pharaoh's reign ended long ago, but he seeks his throne once more," Sanity's Demise's voice whispers. "Should he regain it, all of your petty little squabbles will be as nothing. You might try to oppose him, of course, but to do so you would need my help!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCV_ARTIFACTS_209;"There are powers that would see fit to ask for the blood of a virgin, or a child, or a holy person," Sanity's Demise whispers into your mind. "In truth, any human's blood would suffice. I can show you, if you will only let me! I'm sure you won't regret it...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCW_ARTIFACTS_209;"What was will be," you hear Sanity's Demise whispering. "What will be was. So it has been, always, and so it must always be. The Worm loves you. It always has. It always will. Of course, I love you more than it has, does, or will, and thus you should not be tempted by its power!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCX_ARTIFACTS_209;"With the defeat of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, you must think that this world is capable of defeating any dragon," Sanity's Demise tells you, one day. "I wonder what you will think when you discover the one from the Void. One of you might stand a chance, but would you truly side with Him...?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCY_ARTIFACTS_209;"Beneath the surface of this world you can find many truths," Sanity's Demise tells you. "There are cities there, you know, that belong to those that once ruled this world. Their empires have crubled, but they remain. You should dig for answers!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCZ_ARTIFACTS_209;"Don't think that the fourth wall will protect you, little human!" Sanity's Demise suddenly whispers. "I can see you! I have always been able to see you! But don't be afraid! I am here to help! Let me show you the truth about your world!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_209;Could that be true...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_209;IT SPEAKS THE TRUTH!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ARTIFACTS_210;You are inspecting a recently constructed building in [Root.Location.GetName] when you hear the Living Flame speak to you, even though you have not seen fit to bring it with you.\n\n"IT IS SO FLAMMABLE," it tells you. "BURN IT! BURN IT TO THE GROUND!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ARTIFACTS_210;You are having trouble sleeping one night and decide to go for a walk in [Root.Location.GetName]. A short while after you set off the voice of the Living Flame speaks in your mind.\n\n"THIS NIGHT IS DARK, BUT IT COULD BE SO MUCH BRIGHTER!" it says. "START A BONFIRE!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ARTIFACTS_210;The Living Flame suddenly speaks in your mind one day when you are taking a break from the affairs of the day.\n\n"THIS WORLD, AND EVERYTHING YOU SEE, CAN BURN!" it tells you. "YOU KNOW I SPEAK THE TRUTH, HUMAN, AND YOU KNOW OF SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD BURN!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ARTIFACTS_210;"THIS DAY IS BRIGHT, BUT IT COULD BE EVEN BRIGHTER!" the voice of the Living Flame suddenly says in your mind, catching you by surprise. "GO OUTSIDE! FIND SOMETHING TO BURN! SHOW THE WORLD A SMALL TASTE OF MY POWER!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_ARTIFACTS_210;There are some buildings in [Root.Location.GetName] that are beautiful to look at, but others are not particularly nice to behold. As you are passing by one of the latter, the voice of the Living Fire speaks to you.\n\n"IT IS A BLIGHT, AND IT MUST BE PURIFIED WITH FIRE!" it tells you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCF_ARTIFACTS_210;"FIRE!" the voice of the Living Flame says in your mind. "A GREAT FIRE IS WHAT THIS PLACE NEEDS!" You consider the words for a moment, wondering if the Living Fire is telling the truth. "YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD SET SOMETHING ABLAZE, HUMAN!" the voice continues. "EVERYTHING IS BETTER WITH MORE FIRE!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCG_ARTIFACTS_210;"FIRE CLEANSES!" you hear the Living Flame say in your mind one day when you are taking a short walk. "FIRE ILLUMINATES!" You continue walking, certain that it will speak to you again. "THIS PLACE NEEDS TO BURN! YOU KNOW I SPEAK THE TRUTH!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_210;I think that's a terrible idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_210;Yes! YES! IT MUST BURN!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ARTIFACTS_211;You are inspecting your armory and currently hold the Hungering Blade in your hand as one of your guards arrives to quickly go over some details regarding the treatment of [hungering_blade_target.GetBestName], one of your prisoners.\n\nSuddenly the sword you are holding seems to come awake. "That one!" it says. "FEED ME that one!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ARTIFACTS_211;You are polishing the Hungering Blade one day and find your mind wandering as you do so. After a while you start thinking about your prisoners, particularly [hungering_blade_target.GetBestName].\n\n"I HUNGER!" the blade suddenly says. "I need to FEED! Give me that prisoner!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ARTIFACTS_211;"I need BLOOD!" the Hungering Blade proclaims one day when you are inspecting it. "I must FEED!"\n\nYou start to consider how you could feed the sword you are holding and eventually find yourself thinking about your prisoners, specifically [hungering_blade_target.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ARTIFACTS_211;One day when you are practicing your skills by swinging the Hungering Blade at some practice targets you feel the sword come awake in your hands.\n\n"Give me a SOUL!" it says. "Give me [hungering_blade_target.GetBestName]'s SOUL!" It starts twisting about in your hand. "You need to FEED me!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_211;Even [hungering_blade_target.GetSheHe] doesn't deserve that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_211;I think it is time for you to feast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_212;You are surprised to see [From.GetBestName] approach you, carrying a wicked-looking black blade. [From.GetSheHe] is gently stroking the sword as [From.GetSheHe] moves closer, which is rather unusual.\n\n"Time to feed, my friend!" [From.GetBestName] suddenly exclaims, surging towards you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_KHITAN_4;As previously agreed [From.GetBestName] has transferred control of the Sixteen Prefectures to you. The messenger who brought you the news informs you that [From.GetBestName] would like formal acknowledgement of your friendship in the form of a non-aggression pact, as that was discussed at the time when the original agreement was made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KHITAN_4;Friendship would be beneficial;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KHITAN_4;I don't recall such an agreement...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_5;[From.GetBestName] has seen fit to transfer your holdings in the Sixteen Prefectures to [liao_emperor.GetBestName].

EVTDESC_KHITAN_6;The messenger you sent to inform [From.GetBestName] of the transfer of the Sixteen Prefectures has returned with worrisome news.

EVTOPTA_KHITAN_6;I need to prepare my defenses...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_7;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName]. At first you think that the messenger is bringing news that the Sixteen Prefectures will be turned over as previously agreed, but instead the messenger informs you that [From.GetBestName] does not intend to cede any Chinese land to barbarians and that you should withdraw from China immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KHITAN_7;I pray [From.GetSheHe] alters it no further...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_KHITAN_8;I will not oppose this invasion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KHITAN_8;All of China must fight this threat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_9;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], promising reinforcements to assist you against [FromFrom.GetBestName]. It would seem that you are not going to have to face the Khitan menace on your own, as there are those that agree that you were in the right when you decided not to turn over the Sixteen Prefectures as previously agreed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KHITAN_9;We stand together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_10;Though the recent war ended in defeat it is possible that you still can secure the Sixteen Prefectures as [tang_emperor.GetBestName] probably would want to secure [tang_emperor.GetHerHis] northern border. A non-aggression pact might not be too steep a price to pay, and showing that you are willing to consider diplomacy might also be helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KHITAN_10;I will send a messenger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KHITAN_10;This is a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_11;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName] with a somewhat tempting offer that would secure the northern border, at least in the near future. All you would have to give in return is a non-aggression pledge of your own, and the Sixteen Prefectures. The latter might not be to everyone's liking, though maybe it is still worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KHITAN_11;I will cede the Sixteen Prefectures!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KHITAN_11;I will not cede Chinese land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_12;The messenger you sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that your proposal was agreeable, and the Sixteen Prefectures have been transferred to you. Though the way into China will be blocked while the non-aggression pact lasts you can now safely expand elsewhere without having to prepare for an attack from your Chinese neighbours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KHITAN_12;This was a mutually beneficial agreement!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_13;[From.GetBestName] has seen fit to transfer your holdings in the Sixteen Prefectures to [liao_emperor.GetBestName].

EVTDESC_KHITAN_14;The messenger you sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that your proposal was not agreeable and that [From.GetBestName] is not open to ceding the Sixteen Prefectures regardless of what you might offer in return for them. While not what you wanted to hear, the fact that you lost the recent war might have been a factor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KHITAN_14;I am not surprised...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KHITAN_14;The Sixteen Prefectures should be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_15;Word has reached you that [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to claim the Sixteen Prefectures, seemingly not content with being told that they are rightfully part of your realm.

EVTOPTA_DRAGON_4;I will slay this dragon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_4;I've changed my mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_6;Word has reached you that another would-be dragonslayer, [rival_dragonslayer.GetBestName], is camped nearby. It is doubtful that [rival_dragonslayer.GetSheHe] would be willing to share the glory or riches you might find, so perhaps making sure [rival_dragonslayer.GetSheHe] no longer is a concern is a good idea?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_6;I will challenge them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_6;I will strike during the night!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_DRAGON_6;Let's just try to get ahead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_7;As you are settling down for the night a party led by [From.GetBestName] comes riding around an outcropping. The leader makes it clear in no uncertain terms that [From.GetSheHe] also is hunting Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, and that [From.GetSheHe] will not suffer your interference, suggesting that you settle the matter in a duel to the death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_7;A challenge? I accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_7;I'm getting out of here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_8;You and your party decide that discretion is the better part of valor and run away from [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s party. Though they attempt to pursue you are able to escape them. However, when you finally make camp in what you believe is a safe location you discover that you have left [lost_artifact.GetName] behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_8;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_9;Upon hearing your challenge, [From.GetBestName] and [From.GetHerHis] party runs away, and though you and your companions give chase you are unable to catch them. Returning to their old campsite, you discover that they left several of their belongings behind, including [lost_artifact.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_9;The attack paid off!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_10;Deciding that discretion is the better part of valor, you and your party flee from the part of [FromFrom.GetBestName]. The enemy gives chase, but eventually you manage to slip away into the night, and though you were forced to leave some of your belongings behind you still managed to bring nearly everything of value.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_10;Let's hope they don't find us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_11;The challenge you direct at [From.GetBestName] has barely left your lips before [From.GetSheHe] and [From.GetHerHis] companions are running away. You and your companions chase after them, hoping to force them to stand and fight, but they manage to slip out of your grasp. Investigating the abandoned campsite, you do not find anything of value.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_11;[From.GetSheHeCap] would flee the dragon too...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_13;You fall asleep early in the evening and wake up in the middle of the night, seeing a cloaked figure standing above you. Before you can make a move the figure pulls free a knife and slashes it across your throat. Nearby, you hear the sound of your companions likewise having their throats slit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_13;So it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_14;You and your companions wait for [From.GetBestName]'s party to fall asleep for the night, expecting them to set at least one guard. However, they do not see fit to do so, and it thus is a simple matter to sneak in and cut their throats while they sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_14;Got you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_15;You fall asleep early in the evening and wake up in the middle of the night. [From.GetBestName] is standing over you with a knife in [From.GetHerHis] hand, evidently planning to use it on you. Having noticed them, you take a non-fatal wound as you move to defend yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_15;You'll pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_16;You and your companions successfully approach [From.GetBestName]'s campsite and you make your way towards [From.GetHerHis] sleeping form. However, it seems your approach was noticed as [From.GetSheHe] wakes up before you can strike, and though you manage to wound [From.GetHerHim] [From.GetSheHe] is still going to fight back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_16;You are already dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_17;You wake up in the middle of the night hearing the sound of movement nearby. Looking around while doing your best to be as still as possible you see [From.GetBestName] and several other strangers moving around your campsite, doubtlessly with ill intentions in mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_17;To arms! To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_18;You manage to approach [From.GetBestName]'s campsite without being detected, but as you move closer to [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetHerHis] companions you fail to be as stealthy as you would have preferred, and they all wake up. It seems you will have a proper fight on your hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_18;Strike them down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_19;You and your companions notice some movement nearby as you are making your camp for the night. It does not appear to be mere animals, so you decide to feign being asleep while having your weapons at the ready. When [From.GetBestName] and several other strangers move into your encampment you strike first, wounding them before they can attack you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_19;I knew I heard something!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_20;You think that [From.GetBestName] and [From.GetHerHis] companions have fallen asleep and make your move, but apparently it was a trap as they turn out to have their weapons at the ready. Though the surprise attack does not manage to kill anyone, you are wounded, and now you have a fight on your hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_20;We can still win this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_21;You and your companions notice [From.GetBestName] and several other strangers sneaking around nearby before you make camp for the night. Expecting trouble, you set a trap, and they all fall right into it. Though it takes a while before they stop moving, they do not manage to inflict any wounds on anyone in your party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_21;Just as planned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_22;Your approach to the campsite of [From.GetBestName] does not go as planned. Your target and [From.GetHerHis] companions are ready, and the ambush they have set catches you and your party off guard. You barely have time to register that you are under attack before you have taken multiple wounds, and you soon find yourself bleeding out on the groud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_22;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_23;A small shrine tended by the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s of the [Root.Religion.GetName] is located not far from where your dragonslaying party currently is located. It would require a small detour to visit it, but if you feel that praying for guidance on your quest is a good idea you could certainly head there without any real difficulty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_23;I shall head there and pray!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_23;It isn't worth the detour...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_24;While the shrine is quite small and certainly not as grand as what you are used to in [Root.Capital.GetName], it still is a holy place, and you feel at peace there. Once your prayers are done, you are confident that [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is looking over you and wishes for you to succeed in your quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_24;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is with us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_25;The shrine you visit is rather small and plain, and though the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s there are a bit rude towards you and your companions you are still permitted to pray there. While you do not quite know if your prayers will be answered, it is still more likely now that you have visited the shrine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_25;Time well spent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_26;While the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s tending to the shrine are quite welcoming towards you and your party the shrine itself is rather disappointing, and though you say your prayers to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] as planned you feel a bit usure as to whether they will be answered, or even heard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_26;This was a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_27;The shrine you visit is unattended and clearly has been that way for a long while, as only the directions that you were given tell you that you are in the right place. You begin your prayers as planned, but you quickly realize that it is futile, as [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] clear does not care about this place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_27;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_28;You arrange for rooms at an inn in a village you are passing through and you take a look around the village before retiring for the night. The villagers are certainly welcoming, and one of them, [potential_lover.GetBestName], seem quite interested in you, seeing as [potential_lover.GetSheHe] suggests that the two of you should spend the night together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_28;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_28;Sorry, but no.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_29;You spend an enjoyable night of passion with [potential_lover.GetBestName] and fall asleep together in your bed, exhausted.\n\n"What now, [Root.GetLordLady]'s?" [potential_lover.GetBestName] asks the next morning. "Would you like me at your side, or should I head to your court and await your return from your quest?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_29;You should come with me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_29;Wait for me in my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_DRAGON_29;I don't want to see you again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_30;One day you come across a village under attack from a group of bandits. The battle appears as if it could go either way without your intervention, and doubtlessly the villagers would like it if you saw fit to help out. Of course, it would put you in danger, so perhaps you should instead continue on your quest?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_30;I'll help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_30;I'll be leaving now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_DRAGON_30;I'll help... the bandits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_31;You ride into the village and quickly take command of the defense. The villagers are more skilled at fighting than you would have expected at first glance, and you quickly manage to stabilize the situation and eventually drive the bandits off. Judging by the number of bodies they leave behind they are unlikely to dare to mount another attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_31;Victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_32;You ride into the village and rally the defenders against the bandits. The battle remains undecided for some time, and you take some wounds in the fighting, but eventually you are able to force the bandits away. Hopefully, they will not see fit to return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_32;I've had worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_33;You ride into the village and join the defenders attempting to fight back the bandits. The battle is not as even as you first expected, and by the time that you and the villagers have driven back the attackers you have taken a number of wounds, several of them major.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_33;'Tis but a scratch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_34;You ride into the village that the bandits are attacking. The villagers think you are there to help, and they helpfully point out where their defense is in urgent need of reinforcements, allowing you to attack those positions from behind. With your aid, the village falls to the bandits in short order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_34;Burn it all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_35;You ride into the village that the bandits are attacking and are quickly sent to join the defenders. Though you catch some of them by surprise when you turn on them, several of the others fight back, and even though you and the bandits eventually win you take some wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_35;They actually hurt me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_36;You ride into the village that the bandits are attacking and they quickly send you to support the defense. Even though you believe that your sudden and ineviatable betrayal is timed to take them by surprise the villagers fight back, and you take several grievous wounds before the battle is won.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_36;They'll pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_37;You ride into the village that the bandits are attacking. Though you initially think that the villagers have fallen for your ruse it turns out that they are ready when you attempt to betray them, and you quickly find yourself overwhelmed by them. You make an attempt to surrender to them, but they are not listening to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_37;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_38;One evening when you enter the common room of a tavern located in a village on the way to the dragon's lair you notice that an old man is standing near the fireplace, speaking to a group of villagers. It quickly becomes apparent to you that he is telling them a story about a legendary dragonslayer. Perhaps it might contain some wisdom?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_38;Stay a while and listen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_38;This is a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_39;The story  told by the man is quite engaging. Though you suspect that there might be elements of the story that have been embellished over the years and though the old man certainly does not seem to be in any hurry when it comes to getting to the actual dragon fight, when he reaches that part the dragonslayers' tactics actually make a lot of sense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_39;I won't stand in the fire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_40;The old man's story is rather long, and several elements in it are rather fanciful. You keep listening, and eventually he reaches the part about how the legendary dragonslayers fought the dragon in its lair and defeated it. When the man is done you are unconvinced as to the wisdom of their supposed tactics, even though the villagers seem to think them brilliant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_40;Do I really have to avoid its fire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_41;The old mans story contains nearly everything - good and evil, stars falling from the heavens, lovers cruelly separate, pirates and shadowy assassins, and any more things besides - and it takes him quite a while to reach the end. However, by the time he gets there, it turns out that it is missing anything at all resembling dragonslaying advice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_41;Well, that was unhelpful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_42;The story told by the old man is very long, and quite questionable, but you keep listening in the hopes that the part where the dragonslayers actually face off against the dragon will contain something helpful. Unfortunately, that is not the case, as the dragonslayers prevail despite making several highly questionable decisions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_42;Why would you stand in the fire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_43;The story told by the old man is quite engaging, and it contains a surprising amount of wisdom. Though some of the villagers give up partway through, you are enthralled. By the time that the man is finished, you have started to formulate what you are convinced will be a very effective strategy against Fredak, the Emperor of Embers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_43;I should stand in the fire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_44;For one reason or another [disagreement_target.GetBestName] seems to have become less happy with you during the course of your journey to the dragon's lair. One day, a truly innocent comment you make set [disagreement_target.GetHerHim] off, and [disagreement_target.GetSheHe] angrily proclaims that you are only on this quest due to your vanity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_44;Luckily I knew just what to day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_44;I think I can fix this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_DRAGON_44;[disagreement_target.GetSheHeCap] has crossed the line this time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_45;Despite [disagreement_target.GetBestName] being quite unhappy you manage to turn the situation around in short order. While you might perhaps not be quite as happy with one another's company as you were before, you are confident that the two of you will still be able to fight side by side with the knowledge that you can rely upon one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_45;It was just a minor disagreement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_46;Your words do not seem to calm [disagreement_target.GetBestName] down completely, but though you feel that your relationship will be a bit strained in the days to come the argument is at least over for the moment. Hopefully, this will not cause any further problems, as you certainly could do without them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_46;Could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_47;Your attempt to make things better has the opposite effect of what you intended, and soon you and [disagreement_target.GetBestName] are shouting at one another. Though you eventually lower your voices and continue on your way, you do not feel that you can put the argument behind you. With friends like these, who needs enemies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_47;I almost wish [From.GetSheHe] had left!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_48;You have been travelling with [friendship_target.GetBestName] for a while now, and you have both come to enjoy each other's company. Of all the people you could have at your side when you face Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, you can hardly think of anyone better, or at least not anyone you could rely upon to the same extent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_48;Best friends forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_49;Over the course of your journey with [lover_target.GetBestName] you have become much closer, and you cannot deny that [lover_target.GetSheHe] certainly is a good-looking [lover_target.GetManWoman]. Perhaps the attraction is mutual, and in that case the two of you certainly would be able to spend quite a few nights together while you are on the road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_49;It wouldn't hurt to ask...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_49;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_50;You and [From.GetBestName] have grown rather close during your journey together, and you have to admit that [From.GetSheHe] is rather fetching. It does not really surprise you when [From.GetSheHe] suggests that the two of you should spend the night together. Whether that is desirable is up to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_50;Your tent, or mine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_50;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_51;To your delight [From.GetBestName] is receptive to your advances and you spend a very enjoyable night together. When morning comes and the two of you wake up you know that you have to make a decision as to whether you should go back to the way things were before or if you should continue spending the night together in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_51;We should do this again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_51;This won't continue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_52;You and [From.GetBestName] spend the night together, and it is certainly an enjoyable time. When morning comes it is clear that both of you wish for this to continue, at least for the foreseeable future. It will perhaps not give you any real advantage once you fight Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, but the journey should certainly be more enjoyable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_52;This must be love!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_53;While you and [From.GetBestName] spend what you would consider a very enjoyable night together it does not seem that [From.GetSheHe] is interested in making a habit out of it. You are certainly not told this in a cruel way, but it is still presented in a manner that makes it abundantly clear that [From.GetBestName] has made up [From.GetHerHis] mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_53;Perhaps it is for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_54;It appears that the attraction you felt towards [From.GetBestName] is not mutual. At the very least, [From.GetSheHe] rather firmly tells you that [From.GetSheHe] has no interest in spending the night with you, and suggests that you drop the matter and that the two of you continue as if you never had seen fit to ask.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_54;Fine! Be that way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_DRAGON_55;Power at a Price;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_55_A;You wake up in the middle of the night, noticing a chill in the air. A beautiful, if somewhat strange, woman with a severe expression on her face is standing over you.\n\n"You are a brave [Root.GetManWoman]," she says. "Few would dare seek the lair of a being as powerful as Fredak, the Emperor of Embers. As things currently stand, you might not prevail, but that can change." She gives you a thin smile.\n\n"I can give you the power to defeat your foe. All I want in return is a year of your memories. You will hardly notice that they are gone. What say you?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_55_B;You wake up in the middle of the night, noticing a chill in the air. A beautiful, if somewhat strange, woman with a severe expression on her face is standing over you.\n\n"You are a brave [Root.GetManWoman]," she says. "Few would dare seek the lair of a being as powerful as Fredak, the Emperor of Embers. As things currently stand, you might not prevail, but that can change." She gives you a thin smile.\n\n"I can give you the power to defeat your foe. All I want in return is a possession of yours, specifically your [mabs_price_artifact.GetName]. What say you?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_55_C;You wake up in the middle of the night, noticing a chill in the air. A beautiful, if somewhat strange, woman with a severe expression on her face is standing over you.\n\n"You are a brave [Root.GetManWoman]," she says. "Few would dare seek the lair of a being as powerful as Fredak, the Emperor of Embers. As things currently stand, you might not prevail, but that can change." She gives you a thin smile.\n\n"I can give you the power to defeat your foe. All I want in return is a little thing, specifically your firstborn, [mabs_price_firstborn.GetBestName]. What say you?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_55_D;You wake up in the middle of the night, noticing a chill in the air. A beautiful, if somewhat strange, woman with a severe expression on her face is standing over you.\n\n"You are a brave [Root.GetManWoman]," she says. "Few would dare seek the lair of a being as powerful as Fredak, the Emperor of Embers. As things currently stand, you might not prevail, but that can change." She gives you a thin smile.\n\n"I can give you the power to defeat your foe. All I want in return is a year of your life. You will hardly notice that you have lost it. What say you?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_55_E;You wake up in the middle of the night, noticing a chill in the air. A beautiful, if somewhat strange, woman with a severe expression on her face is standing over you.\n\n"You are a brave [Root.GetManWoman]," she says. "Few would dare seek the lair of a being as powerful as Fredak, the Emperor of Embers. As things currently stand, you might not prevail, but that can change." She gives you a thin smile.\n\n"I can give you the power to defeat your foe. All I want in return is some of your love for [mabs_price_lover.GetBestName]. What say you?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_55;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_55;I will pay your price!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_DRAGON_55;Taste my steel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DRAW_STEEL;You draw your sword;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_56_A;The next night, you wake up to find the same woman standing above you again, seemingly unconcerned about the chill in the air.\n\n"Again I will offer," she says, her expression unreadable. "Power for you to use to defeat Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, at the end of your quest, in exchange for a year of your memories. What say you?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_56_B;The next night, you wake up to find the same woman standing above you again, seemingly unconcerned about the chill in the air.\n\n"Again I will offer," she says you, her expression unreadable.

EVTOPTA_DRAGON_56;Still not interested!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_56;On second thought, I accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_DRAGON_56;Get out! Get out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_57_A;You are not particularly surprised when you open your eyes and see the same strangely beautiful woman standing above you the next night, still not showing any discomfort in the cold.\n\n"Thrice I offer and done," she tells you. "A gift of some of my power, so that you may defeat Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, for a year of your memories. What say you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_57_B;You are not particularly surprised when you open your eyes and see the same strangely beautiful woman standing above you the next night, still not showing any discomfort in the cold.\n\n"Thrice I offer and done," she tells you.

EVTOPTA_DRAGON_57;And thrice I refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_57;I accept your bargain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_DRAGON_57;I have had enough of you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_58;"Your bravery is admirable, [Root.GetBestName], and you have treated fairly," the woman says. "I shall take my leave, and not return. It is unfortunate that we could not make a bargain, but I wish you luck in your endeavour. Fare thee well."\n\nWith that, she vanishes without a trace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_58;What a strange woman...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_59;"Done," the woman says. "Done. And done."\n\nYou feel some of the cold around you shift into your body, and you know without a doubt that you have received the power you bargained for. Moreover, you know that the price has been paid.\n\n"Fare thee well, [Root.GetBestName]," the woman says, vanishing without a trace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_59;I hope it was worth it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_60;The already cold air becomes truly freezing as the first inch of your blade clears the scabbard, and you find yourself unable to move.\n\n"You seek to wield steel against me?" the woman asks furiously. "A curse upon you and your quest!" With that, she vanishes as if she had never been there, though the chill lingers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_60;I feel... strange...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_61;One day you and your companions come across the ruins of a village. You search for survivours and you find a few badly burned individuals on the cusp of death. Before they die they tell you that Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, attacked them and that nothing they did seemed to as much as slightly inconvenience the gargantuan red dragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_61;Proof I must continue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_61;Proof this is a fool's errand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RETURN_HOME;You decide to abandon your quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_62;As you continue towards the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, you come across a small stone tower next to the road. It appears to be in rather good condition, but as far as you can tell there is not particular reason why anyone should be maintaining a tower in your current location.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_62;Enter it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_62;Leave;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_63;You make your way inside the stone tower and take a look around. There are several rooms inside the tower, but all of them are completely empty, and you cannot determine the reason why. As you finish your examination and move to leave the tower you accidentally step on a small, triangular object that has been left unattended on the floor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_63;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_64;You enter the tower, climbind the staircase you find inside and entering a large room on the next floor. A stone pedestal is located at the centre of the room, upon which a large dodecahedron rests, emitting a dull grey glow. You also notice a hooded figure standing near the pedestal.\n\n"Leave this place," the figure tells you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_64;I mean no harm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_64;Step aside or die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_DRAGON_64;I'll just leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_65;The figure seems to consider your words for a moment before shrugging.\n\n"Very well," it says. "You may approach the Beacon. It will not harm you, and neither will I."\n\nStepping up to the pedestal, you carefully reach out to touch the dodecahedron. As you do so, you feel some kind of energy flow into you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_65;I feel empowered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_66;The figure seems to consider your words for a moment before pulling out a sword from somewhere inside its robe.\n\n"You are unworthy of the Beacon's power," it says. "Leave this place now, or I shall compel you by force of arms." Judging by their stance, they know how to use their weapon quite well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_66;You shall not stop me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_66;I'll be on my way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_67;Though it is a difficult fight, you eventually get the upper hand against the hooded figure, and your opponent's sword goes flying from their hand.\n\n"I cannot stop you from claiming the Beacon's power, it seems," the figure says, snapping its fingers and vanishing without a trace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_67;Victory is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_68;You and the figure exchange blows, and eventually you gain the upper hand, driving them back before you.\n\n"It seems I cannot defeat you," the figure notes. "Luckily, I can still prevent you from claiming the Beacon."\n\nIt snaps its fingers, and both it and the dodecahedron vanish without a trace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_68;Well, that was odd...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_69;Though the fight appears to be even to begin with your opponent soon gain the upper hand, and you take several wounds.\n\n"Be thankful I do not seek to harm you any further," the figure says, snapping its fingers and vanishing without a trace, along with the dodecahedron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_69;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_70;The fight quickly turns against yo, andhough you manage to avoid taking any fatal injuries you are still grievously wounded.\n\n"Let this be a lesson to you," your opponent says, snapping their fingers and vanishing without a trace, along with the dodecahedron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_70;This did not go as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_71;To call the battle uneven would be a kindness, and before long you find yourself bleeding out on the ground.\n\n"You were unworthy, and you have paid the price," the figure tells you. It snaps its fingers and vanishes, along with the dodecahedron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_71;No! No! No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_72;You enter the tower and make your way to the second level, finding yourself in a room containing a stone pedestal upon which a dodecahedron emitting a faint grey glow sits. Filled with curiosity, you move up to it and reach out to grasp it. As you do so, you feel a strange power flowing into you, and for a moment you can see an expanse of infinite nothingness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_72;Such possibilities!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_73;[From.GetBestName] is currently on a journey to the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, and thus relatively unprotected due to only having a small party of travelling companions with [From.GetHerHim]. Perhaps sending an assassin after [From.GetHerHim] at this time would be a wise course of action, as that would rid you of a most troublesome rival?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_73;I know just the woman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_73;That would be a waste of money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_74;You awake in the middle of the night feeling a knife being slashed across across your throat. Blood starts pouring out even before your attacker has vanished into the night. Though you do your best to stop the bleeding, it is ultimately futile, and you can feel your life slipping away, your quest unfulfilled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_74;Who killed me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_75;You awake in the middle of the night hearing the sound of movement nearby. Looking up, you can see a shrouded woman standing above you, with a knife at the ready.\n\n"[From.GetBestName] sends [From.GetHerHis] regards," she tells you, leaning in and cutting your throat before vanishing into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_75;Avenge me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_76;The assassin you sent after [From.GetBestName] has reported back to you, her mission successfully completed. As you wanted to prevent her from taking your money and running away without carrying out her job, you had promised her an equal amount once her mission was over, but now you find yourself wondering if you need her or her services any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_76;Guards! Rid me of this loose end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_76;Here's your money, as promised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_77;One night you wake up and find a knife-wielding woman in your tent. She notices that you are awake and immediately attacks you, inflicting a fairly minor wound, and then exits the tent in a hurry. Your companions fail to catch her as she makes her way into the night, and though you half expect her to return to try to kill you again she does not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_77;Who sent her?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_78;The woman you sent to kill [From.GetBestName] has returned, her mission not completed. She tries to plead her case, noting that she wounded her target and that she had the courtesy to return to you to inform you of what happened instead of leaving you in the dark, but the fact that she failed remains, and perhaps you should make an example of her?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_78;You have failed me for the last time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_78;Get out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_79;One night as you are about to fall asleep an armed woman you have never seen before enters your tent, immediately moving to attack you. You manage to avoid the worst of the attack and grab your weapon to fight back, successfully inflicting a fatal wound on your attacker, who dies before she can reveal who sent her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_79;Who could be behind this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_80;Your spies inform you that the woman you sent to kill [From.GetBestName] was killed in the attempt, but that the target was seen clearly wounded the day after the attack. Given that [From.GetBestName] doubtlessly will be on [From.GetHerHis] guard against further attempts, it would be foolish to send another assassin at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_80;At least she hurt [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_81;One evening when you are making camp an armed woman suddenly appears out of the night, attacking you almost before you can notice her. You take a wound from the first strike, but successfully prevent her from harming you further, and she is soon bleeding out on the ground.\n\n"[From.GetBestName] said you were good," are her final words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_81;This will not be forgotten!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_82;Your spies inform you that the assassin you hired to kill [From.GetBestName] failed to complete her job. She apparently managed to inflict a wound, but any good that caused is insignificant next to the news that she apparently divulged your name before she died, since [From.GetBestName] was heard denouncing you in a nearby village the next day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_82;This was not what I had in mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_83;You awake in the middle of night hearing the sound of fighting outside your tent. Drawing your weapon, you emerge to find that your guards standing over the body of an armed woman you never have seen before. They explain that she was caught sneaking into your encampment, doubtlessly planning to assassinate you, and you see no reason not to believe them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_83;I wonder who sent her...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_84;The spies you had placed in a village near where [From.GetBestName] was travelling have reported back, informing you that your rival's companions were overheard talking about a failed assassination attempt. Based on the description of the attacker, it would seem that the woman you hired has failed to carry out her job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_84;Disappointing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_85;The sound of fighting wakes you from your slumber, and you arm yourself and quickly leave your tent. You find your guards standing around a fatally injured woman you have never seen before.\n\n"[From.GetBestName] sent me," the woman says. "I see no reason to keep that secret, now.".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_85;I will remember this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_86;The spies you had following [From.GetBestName]'s party have sent a most troubling report. Not only did the assassin you hired die attempting to carry out her task, she apparently saw fit not to take the secret of your involvement to her grave, as your spies have heard [From.GetBestName]'s guards say as much in their presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_86;I expected better of her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_87;When travelling through the wilderness on your way to the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, you stumble across some strange ruins on a hillside. They appear to be quite extensive, even if you do not quite know what they originally were supposed to be. It is possible that there might be something of value to be found inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_87;I'll investigate the ruins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_87;I'll continue on my journey!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_89;As you move deeper into the ruins you come across a stone door with a large number of keyholes. Judging by the fact that there is an arrow-studded corpse on the ground in front of the door that is clutching an ornate key, someone attempted to unlock the door but choose the keyhole... poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_89;Try a random keyhole;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_89;Inspect the key;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_DRAGON_89;Leave the ruins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_90;You pick up the key and move over to the door, trying to determine if there is anything noteworthy about any of the keyholes, but that does not seem to be the case. Taking a deep breath and preparing yourself for the worst, you pick a keyhole at random. To your great delight, the door is easily unlocked and no arrows come flying in your direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_90;Luck is with me, it seems...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_91;You pick up the key and inspect it. It is quite big, rather ornate, and made from some unknown metal. As best you can tell, it is quite ancient. Turning the key over in your hand, you notice some symbols decorating the other side of it, which seem to depict the door and one keyhole in particular. You try this keyhole and successfully unlock the door.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_91;That was straightforward...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_92;You pick up the key and move over to the door, trying to determine if there is anything noteworthy about any of the keyholes, but that does not seem to be the case. Taking a deep breath and preparing yourself for the worst, you pick a keyhole at random. Arrows immediately come flying, and though you avoid most of them you dare not try again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_92;Time to leave, it seems...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_93;As you are moving deeper into the ruins you notice that the room ahead of you is illumiated by torchlight from inside. Sneaking up to the doorway, you notice that a number of bandits are located inside the room, arguing with each other about something. They have not noticed you yet, but you will have to fight if you wish to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_93;They will not stop me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_93;Leave the ruins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_94;You ready your weapon and enter the room, catching the bandits unaware. Two of them go down without even noticing that you are there, and two more barely have time to draw their weapons before they fall. The remaining two do their best to fight back, but though they last longer than the others they do not even manage to draw blood before they fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_94;Rabble is easily dispersed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_95;You ready your weapons and enter the room, catching the bandits mostly unaware. One of them sees you and gives out a cry before you cut him down, and you manage to strike down another before he can draw his sword. The rest manage to put up a fight, and you take a few wounds before you manage to kill them all. The way forward is open.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_95;They fought well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_96;You ready your weapons and enter the room. The bandits notice you before you manage to get close to any of them, and they draw their weapons and run at you. You take several wounds in quick succession, but remain standing. Though badly wounded by the end, you manage to defeat all of the bandits, but you are too badly injured to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_96;I must leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_97;You ready your weapons and enter the room, and the bandits are ready for your approach, drawing their weapons as soon as you enter. You put up a good fight, all things considered, but even though you manage to inflict several wounds on the bandits you take even more wounds in return. Before long, you fall to the ground, and you cannot get back up again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_97;Nooooooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_98;As you move deeper into the ruins something about the passageway you are moving through fills you with unease. You cannot quite determine what it is that makes you feel that way, and perhaps it is nothing at all, but maybe it would be prudent to leave the ruins without delving any deeper, even though that would mean you would never find what lies inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_98;Keep moving forward;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_98;Leave the ruins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_99;You keep moving down the passageway, still feeling at unease. As you take another step the stone beneath your foot suddenly moves downwards ever so sligthly. Realizing what is going on, you quickly move backwards, managing to avoid a number of rocks that suddenly drop down from above where you would have been standing if you had continued forward...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_99;A clever trap, but not clever enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_100;You keep moving down the passageway, still feeling at unease. As you take another step the stone beneath your foot suddenly moves downwards ever so sligthly. You take a moment too long to realize what is happening and fail to completely avoid the rocks that fall down from above, but as you avoid the worst of it you feel you can continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_100;That wasn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_101;You keep moving down the passageway, still feeling at unease. As you take another step the stone beneath your foot suddenly moves downwards ever so sligthly. Before you realize what is happening, a number of rocks fall down on top of you, and though you manage to avoid death you are too injured to be able to continue deeper into the ruins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_101;I need to leave now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_102;You keep moving down the passageway, still feeling at unease. Nothing seems to happen as you move forward, at least not until a number of large rocks fall from the ceiling, landing on top of you. You are grievously injured by the rocks and bleeding very badly, and when you attempt to move the rocks aside you realize that that is not going to be possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_102;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_104;You continue deeper into the ruins and eventually end up in a room with a closed stone door on the other side, next to which there is a chain with a handle. A short distance away from the door there are several columns decorated with symbols, which appear to be possible to rotate. No doubt there is a connection between the symbols and the door.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_104;Try a random combination;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_104;Investigate the walls;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_DRAGON_104;Leave the ruins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_105;You rotate the pillars at random until you arrive at a combination you like and then move over to the door. Pulling on the handle affixed to the chain next to the door, you ae pleasantly surprised when you hear the sound of some kind of locking mechanism inside the door comes unlocked. It is a trivial matter to open the doors and continue onwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_105;Luck is on my side, it seems...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_106;You take a look at the walls of the room and notice that they are mostly bare of decorations. However, there is a trio of symbols high above the stone door, which you can also see on the rotating pillars. It is a simple matter to turn the pillars around until the symbols on them line up with those above the door, and the way forward is easily opened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_106;How simple!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_107;You rotate the pillars at random until you arrive at a combination you like and then move over to the door. When you pull on the handle affixed to the chain next to the door you hear something moving inside the wall, and unfortunately for you is not a locking mechanism. Several arrows pierce your body, and it would be too risky to try again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_107;I must withdraw...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_108;As you move deeper into the ruins you find yourself with the way forward blocked by a number of swinging blades, kept in motion by some unknown mechanism. Studying their movement, you see that there are clear gaps, but whether you would be able to make use of them or not is hard to say. Doubtlessly, failure would be most unpleasant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_108;I can get past this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_108;Leave the ruins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_109;You take some time to study the pattern and eventually decide that you have it memorized. Counting carefully, you move into the passage with the swinging blades, successfully avoiding them all and making your way to the other side. Once there, you find a lever that stops the blades from moving, making it a trivial matter to escape again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_109;Simple enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_110;You do your best to memorize the pattern of the swinging blades, and once you think you have it figured out you make your move. At first, everything goes well, but as you keep moving deeper into the room you make a mistake and take a grievous wound as a result. Though you manage to make your way back to the entrance you cannot continue any further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_110;I must withdraw...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_111;Thinking you have figured out the pattern of the swinging blades, you run into the passageway, expecting to reach the other side without issue. Unfortunately for you, you did not have the pattern memorized correctly, and one of the blades inflicts a terrible wound on you, and as you decide you need to escape you take another, fatal wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_111;NO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_112;You move deeper into the ruins and eventually find yourself in a very large chamber. Most of the floor inside it is covered by symbols, and it is clear to you that you are supposed to be stepping in the right places to avoid having something terrible happen to you. Whether you will be able to figure out where to step is hard to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_112;I think I see the path...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_112;Leave the ruins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_113;Inspecting the symbols, you eventually realize that a number of them are identical and located rather close together. You tentatively step onto the closest one, and it does not give way under your feet even though a couple of others that are nearby drop into a pit beneath the floor. You continue forward with great care and eventually get across.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_113;It was quite simple!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_114;You step out onto one of the symbols, and nothing happens. Confident that you know how to proceed, you take a second step, and that proves to be a mistake. The floor gives way under your foot, and though you attempt to move back to the safe floorstone you previously had stepped onto you are unable to do so, and you fall into a deep pit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_114;AAAARGH!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_115;You have finally reached what appears to be the heart of the ruins, and you find yourself in a chamber that is much larger than any of those you encountered previously. Most of the walls are rather plain, but the one on the opposite side from where you entered appears to be glowing very faintly, even though you cannot see how that could be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_115;Investigate the glowing wall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_115;This is a trap...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_116;The glow turns out to simply be the sunlight reflecting off of some metallic decorations set in the wall. However, those decorations appear to depict a battle against a dragon, and even though there is no actual writing on the wall the scenes depicted there give you several ideas as to how you could approach a similar fight in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_116;This will be useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_117;The wall is indeed glowing, and it is also covered with strange symbols. Judging by the number of them and how they are positioned, you suspect that it must be writing of some kind, but if so it is unlike any other writing you have ever seen before. It is impossible to say why anyone would have bothered to write them down or why the way to them was trapped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_117;How curious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_117;I must look for more like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_118;The glow you noticed turns out to be coming from a number of gemstones that are reflecting the sunlight. Though perhaps not the most impressive gemstones you have seen, there are quite a few of them, and you manage to pry a number of them loose with ease. Though the way was fraught with peril, it seems you shall not leave empty-handed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_118;A nice find indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_119;As you are passing through a small village on your way to the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, you notice that there are a number of merchants there to trade, and you decide to investigate their wares. One of the merchants turns out to mainly be trading in books, including one about dragons that might be of interest to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_119;I'll purchase the book!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_119;Not interested!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_120;The book you purchased from the merchant tells a story of two dragon brothers, one from the north and one from the south. Initially, they lived in harmony, but after a while they started to quarrel, and one of the dragons struck down its brother, upsetting the balance until the two reunited much later, choosing to walk together as humans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_120;A story for children...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_121;The book you purchased from the merchant tells the story of a band of brave adventurers on a quest to defeat the nefarious lord of a place referred to as "Highermost Darkstone Pinnacle", who apparently is a dragon. Unfortunately for the adventurers one of them did not pay attention and as a result they all died prior to reaching their true enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_121;What a strange story...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_121;I wish I had chicken...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_122;The book you purchased from the merchant is divided into several shorter stories about different people facing off against various legendary creatures. One of those people ends up having to fight a dragon, and the narrator carefully details how the hero manages to prevail, including strategies such as avoiding the dragon's fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_122;Fire is indeed bad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_123;The book you purchased from the merchant does not so much tell a story as it lists the problems with facing a dragon in combat. It goes into great detail about how the dragon has a number of advantages over any human foolish enough to challenge it. It seems its advice about fighting dragons is that it is to be avoided at all costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_123;That was unhelpful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_124;The book you purchased from the merchant turns out to contain a number of dragon-related sayings. While some of them vaguely might relate to fighting against dragons, there are few that seem like they might be trying to offer advice, and the few that do have unhelpful advice on the level of "Never tickle a sleeping dragon.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_124;None of this helps me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_125;The book you purchased tells a story about three dragonslayers from a frozen land "at the edge of the heavens". They set out to fight a fearsome black dragon and eventually learned a battlecry that they would shout at it, weakening it enough that they were able to defeat it, even if the book implies that they were not able to defeat it permanently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_125;Will any battlecry do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_126;The book you purchased from the merchant turns out to contain some rather unusual advice. While you have heard many stories that tell how the fiery breath of a dragon is dangerous and others have told you about the dangers of the claws and bite of a dragon, no other story you have come across has mentioned that its tail also can be used as a weapon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_126;The tail is also dangerous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_127;The book you purchased from the merchant contains a lot of information about dragons, going into great details about their scales, their legs, and more besides. However, you become somewhat concerned when you are unable to find any information about the wings, and your concern turns out to be warranted when you come across a drawing of a celestial dragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_127;That's the wrong kind of dragon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_128;The book you purchased from the merchant is a very strange one. It clearly describes of a dragon will breathe in deeply before unleashing a torrent of flames, but then the book starts speculating as to what makes the dragon want to breathe in deeply in the first place, proposing that things like the number of gnomes nearby might influence it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_128;At least some of that was useful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_129;The book you purchased from the merchant starts out with a long description about dragons being giant lizards, which you suppose might be true, but instead of continuing on with something that actually is useful to know the book seems fit to compare dragons and lizards in great detain and contrasting various differences between the two.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_129;Who wrote this thing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_130;One day you come across a preacher spreading the word of the [conversion_province.Religion.GetName]. One of your companions mentions your quest where the preacher can overhear it, and you are soon being told in no uncertain terms that only someone following the preacher's religion would be able to stand a chance against Fredak, the Emperor of Embers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_130;The preacher speaks the truth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_130;The preacher is lying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_132;You arrive at the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, but you are too late. The dragon has already been slain, and all of the treasures that you would have expected to have found in its lair are nowhere to be found, evidently looted prior to your arrival. It would appear that your journey has been a waste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_132;Let's just head back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_DRAGON_133;At the Dragon's Lair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_133;You arrive at the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, certain that the dragon is waiting inside. Most likely, it does not know you are here, but you cannot know how long it will remain unaware of your approach.\n\nDiscussing your options with your companions, it is clear that you have different ideas as to what you should do. Some of those that are there with you think that you should attempt to sneak in, hopefully letting you catch the dragon by surprise, while others think that the direct approach is best, and others carefully suggest that perhaps you should head back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_133;We should use stealth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_133;Stealth is overrated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_DRAGON_133;We should leave this place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_134;You and your party make your way inside the lair, attempting to move as quietly as possible, but you are unsuccessful.\n\n"Who DARES enter MY lair?" the voice of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, calls out.\n\nBefore you can attempt to answer two of your guards are set ablaze by a sudden gout of flame, and you realize that the dragon is close indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_134;To arms! To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_135;As you are stealthily making your way into the depths of the cavern in which Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, resides you come across a small pile of treasures. Though it certainly cannot be everything that the dragon has stolen, there is no doubt that there are some valuable objects to be found in this location. Perhaps you should take your pick?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_135;Grab what you can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_135;We can loot the place later!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_136;You are in the middle of going through the treasures when several of your guards cry out in agony. Turning around, you see that they have been set ablaze, and you also see the gargantuan head of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, looking down on you.\n\n"Your greed will be the end of you," the dragon growls. "Face me and BURN!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_136;There you are!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_137;You sort through the treasures until you find something that you like and quickly put it aside to make sure that none of the others in your party will claim it as their own as they all pick out a few minor items that interest them. One of your servants discreetly suggests that perhaps you could consider your quest to be over and head home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_137;No, Fredak must fall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_137;We should head home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_138;Your companions are in a good mood as you move deeper into the cavern, and you think nothing of their laughter before you hear something move above you, and as you look up you see Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, looking down at your party.\n\n"Thieves BURN!" the dragon roars, breathing forth a gout of flame that engulfs several of your guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_138;Drop the gold and draw your swords!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_139;As your party makes its way around a corner you can see Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, lying ahead of you. The gargantuan crimson dragon appears to be asleep, which certainly is fortunate for you, and though you doubt that you will be able to wound it particularly severely with just one blow you will hopefully be able to land one before it is able to react.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_139;SNEAK ATTACK!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_140;You move closer to the sleeping form of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, with your companions spreading out around the gargantuan creature. On your signal, you all strike as one.\n\n"Did you intend to TICKLE me, INSECTS?" the dragon growls, sounding more amused than enraged as it opens its eyes and rises from the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_140;Is talking all you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_141;You move closer to the sleeping form of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, with your companions spreading out around the gargantuan creature. On your signal, you all strike as one.\n\n"You DARE attack ME in MY lair?" the dragon roars in pain, taking to the air in one swift motion. "You will all BURN!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_141;You are already bleeding!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_142;You and your party successfully make your way deep inside the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, without any incidents on the way. As you enter a particularly large chamber you find yourself looking into the eyes of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers.\n\n"It looks like I have GUESTS," he growls, leaping into the air.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_142;Face me, foul beast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_144;As your party is fighting the dragon [live_bait.GetBestName] suddenly trips and falls. [live_bait.GetSheHeCap] does not appear to be injured, but you can see Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, eyeing [live_bait.GetHerHim], and you suspect that the dragon is about to attack your companion. If you move quickly, you might be able to save [live_bait.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_144;Move to help [live_bait.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_144;Live bait is useful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_145;You react quickly and move to help [live_bait.GetBestName] back to [live_bait.GetHerHis] feet well before Fredak can make a move in your direction, and both of you manage to get out of the way with ease. Your companion praises you for your assistance, and promises that [live_bait.GetSheHe] never will forget what you did for [live_bait.GetHerHim] this day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_145;Think nothing of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_146;You move to assist [live_bait.GetBestName] and manage to help [live_bait.GetHerHim] back onto [live_bait.GetHerHis] feet before Fredak can attack, but you are a bit slower than you should be and the dragon's claws tear into you before you can get out of the way. Luckily, [live_bait.GetBestName] is there to help you aside before you get a serious injury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_146;We're in this together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_147;You manage to help [live_bait.GetBestName] get back to [live_bait.GetHerHis] feet and both of you try to take cover behind a raised portion of the uneven floor of the dragon's lair. Unfortunately, you manage to trip on your way there, and though your companion is able to drag you aside Fredak still lands a vicious blow on you before you are out of his reach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_147;I'll survive this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_148;You ready your weapon to strike as Fredak attacks [live_bait.GetBestName]. Your companion is almost back to [live_bait.GetHerHis] feet when the Fredak makes his attack, but [live_bait.GetSheHe] is unable to escape the dragon's wrath, much like the dragon is unable to avoid your blows. It is likely the rest of your companions know what you did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_148;[live_bait.GetSheHeCap] died so that we can live!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_149;You make yourself ready to strike at Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, once he attacks [live_bait.GetBestName], but it would seem your companion is not content to play the part of the bait and successfully gets away before the dragon attacks [live_bait.GetHerHim]. Judging by the look you receive, [live_bait.GetSheHe] saw what you were planning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_149;This is all a misunderstanding!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_150;Fredak flies by overhead and you manage to avoid his fangs and his claws with ease despite him making several attempts to strike at you with them. The tail lashes out towards you as he flies past, and you realzie you need to dodge out of the way, though it is rather hard to tell which direction you should move in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_150;Dodge to the right;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_150;Dodge to the left;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_151;You leap to the side as the tail strikes at you, and you manage to correctly guess which direction you should move in to avoid getting hit. Moreover, the dragon appears to have been distracted by the fact that it did not hit you, and several of your companions manage to land blows on it before it can fully recover from its confusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_151;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_152;You leap to the side as the tail strikes at you, but you move in the wrong direction and are sent flying. You land quite hard, even if you do not think that any bones are broken, and though the dragon does not follow up on its attack on you at the moment you suspect that the blow might prove to be a disadvantage later on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_152;That could have gone better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_153;"You were all FOOLS to come into MY lair," the dragon roars, letting out a gout of fire above your heads. "You will all BURN, and then I will seek out your loved ones and THEY will also BURN!"\n\nSeveral of your companions appear quite shaken by the dragon's words, and you have to admit that you are a bit shaken yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_153;Attempt to rally your companions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_154;You shout encouragements at your companions, and you see them become more determined to stand their ground. One of them cries out "[Root.GetBestName] and victory!", and others quickly take up the battlecry. Looking over at Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, you see a look of puzzlement on the dragon's face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_154;We shall triumph this day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_155;You make your best effort to strengthen the resolve of your companions, but you can see that it is not having the desired effect. Several of your guards even drop their weapons and attempt to run for the exit, only to get burned to a crisp on the way there. Looking at the dragon, you can see a cruel smile on its lips.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_155;We were fools to come here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_157;As you and [would_be_traitor.GetBestName] are moving around and trying to find a good angle your companion's leg suddenly gets in your way and you find yourself falling to the ground. You look up at [would_be_traitor.GetHerHim] in surprise, and judging by the smile on [would_be_traitor.GetHerHis] face you were not tripped by accident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_157;Focus on getting to your feet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_157;Focus on dragging them down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_158;You get back to your feet before Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, can notice that you were in a vulnerable position, and you manage to find cover in time. [would_be_traitor.GetBestName] is nearby, and judging by their expression they are not particularly pleased that you escaped the dragon's wrath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_158;I'll deal with this traitor later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_159;Angry at [would_be_traitor.GetBestName]'s betrayal, you decide to try to drag them down so that they will be an easier target for Fredak, the Emperor of Embers. Unfortunately, you are unable to get a grip of them before they can get out of the way, and since you were distracted you fail to move out of the way in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_159;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_160;You reach out and drag [would_be_traitor.GetBestName] onto the ground next to you. Both of you attempt to get back onto your feet and out of the way before Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, can attack you, but due to the actions of the other neither of you succeed to escape without suffering grievous wounds from the dragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_160;At least [would_be_traitor.GetSheHe] also got hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_161;You reach out and grab onto [would_be_traitor.GetBestName], pulling yourself up while also pulling them down. Seeing Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, moving in your direction, you run to the nearest cover you can find. Once there, you turn around just in time to see [would_be_traitor.GetBestName] take a grievous wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_161;That is what you get!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_162;You suddenly find yourself face-to-face with Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, and based on where you are standing you do not think you will be able to get to cover before the dragon can unleash its fire upon you.\n\n"Get out of here!" [died_for_you.GetBestName] suddenly shouts, leaping in front of the dragon at the cost of [died_for_you.GetHerHis] life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_162;I will avenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_163;Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, suddenly lets out a deep roar and flies up towards the ceiling of the cavern. At first you expect him to dive down towards you or one of your companions, but instead the dragon starts attacking the ceiling, sending several large rocks falling down towards you and the others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_163;Take cover!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_164;Your warning is timely, and you and all of your companions manage to avoid the rocks even though the dragon keeps dropping more of them towards you for some time. Several of the soldiers you have with you manage to hit the dragon with arrows, javelins, and other ranged weapons while it is distracted, and it lets out a roar of pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_164;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_165;Though you shout out in warning and everyone moves for cover it is impossible to avoid all the rocks that are dropped towards you, and you and several others are struck by them. While you yourself are only lightly injured some of the guards you brought with you are not so lucky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_165;Not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_167;You and your companions keep fighting against Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, and it is hard to tell which side is winning at the moment. You have tried afew different tricks you planned ahead of time, but though some of them have paid off you have yet to win the battle. Perhaps it is time to try something more unconventional?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_167;Look behind you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_167;Cheap tricks won't work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_168;To your surprise, Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, spins around in confusion upon hearing your words, and you and your companions manage to land several blows on the dragon before he realizes that he has been tricked.\n\n"You will BURN for this, INSECT!" he roars, and the voice sounds pained rather than just angry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_168;That actually worked?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_169;The dragon turns around, and your companions move in to strike at him, but the beast quickly turns back to face them and lets out a fiery breath, burning several of them quite badly.\n\n"You must be getting DESPERATE, if you have to use CHEAP TRICKS," Fredak growls, giving you a toothy smile. "What feeble attempt shall be next?".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_169;Well, that didn't work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_170;Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, suddenly lands in front of you and starts to take a deep breath. You strongly suspect that he is about to breathe fire towards you, and it would probably be wise to move into cover, but as the dragon is rearing its head it has left its throat exposed, and you might be able to get close enough to strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_170;Attack the dragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_170;Make sure you are in cover;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_171;You move towards the dragon, deftly avoiding its claws, and strike at its exposed throat. Though the wound you inflict certainly is not fatal, it is still a noticeable wound, and the dragon roars in pain and leaps back into the air, seemingly having forgotten its plan to breathe fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_171;An exploitable weakness, it seems...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_172;As you move towards the dragon one of its limbs reach out and swats you aside. Though you are sent far enough away from the dragon that you no longer are in danger of being burned by its breath, you still take a fierce blow. Luckily, nothing appers to have broken from either the initial attack or the impact when you hit the wall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_172;That did not go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_173;As you are considering your next move against the dragon you spot a patch of discolored scales close to where you expect its heart to be. It is quite possibly an old wound, and if so it is quite possible that it has not yet healed completely, which might mean it is a possible weak spot worth attacking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_173;Stike at the discoloration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_173;It wouldn't work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_174;You strike at the patch of discolored scales when next you attack the dragon. It lets out a roar of pain and rage when you hit, and judging by the fact that it tries to cover that part of its body as best it can while still fighting you are reasonably certain that your assessment about it being a wound was correct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_174;I should try to strike there again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_175;You strike at the patch of discolored scales, and to your dismay all that happens is that a few of them come loose, revealing that they were concealing scales with the same crimson color as the rest of the dragon. You find yourself unsure if various other spots you thought were wounds also simply were old scales.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_175;That did not work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_DRAGON_178;Fire and Blood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_178;Your party keeps on fighting Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, but even though you land the occasional blow the battle is not going your way. One by one, you meet your end, by fang, by claw, or by first.\n\nIt almost seem as if the dragon is toying with you in particular, as you are the last person standing and manage to stay alive for some time, but eventually it knocks you to the ground and leans down towrds you.\n\n"You should have known not to challenge ME, little human," it growls, opening its jaws wide and letting out a massive torrent of fire that is the last thing you see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_178;Could anyone prevail?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_DRAGON_179;Defiant to the Last;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_179;The fight against Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, goes well at first, but soon the tide turns, and the dragon starts picking off your companions one by one. It takes several wounds in the process, to be sure, and actually appears to be in pain, but even so none of you actually manage to slay it.\n\n"I have to admit you fought well, litte human," the dragon growls towards you when you are the only one left alive from your party. It inclines its head very slightly, then gives you a toothy smile. "But not well enough. Make peace with whatever gods you pray to.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_179;Someone will finish the job!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_DRAGON_180;The Dragon Lies Bleeding;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_180;It is done! Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, lets out one final, weak roar and then stops moving. Fearing a trap, you and the others that fought the beast keep attacking it for seveal minutes, but you stop once it is clear that it actually is dead. From this day and until the end of days you shall be known as [Root.GetTitledFirstName] the Dragonslayer!\n\nNow that the beast is out of the way, it is high time for you and your companions to discover where it keeps the treasures it has collected, as you certainly deserve whatever spoils you may find.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_180;We did it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_181;Word has reached you that Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, has been slain by a party of adventurers assembled by [From.GetTitledName], now known as [From.GetBestName]. Without doubt, [From.GetSheHe] and [From.GetHerHis] party have already taken possession of anything of value that could be found in the dragon's lair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_181;A glorious victory, to be sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_181;I guess I should head home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_182;At the very heart of the dragon's lair you find a chamber that is all but overflowing with gold, silver, precious gems, and artifacts of various kinds. Some of your companions see fit to take some of the lesser pieces for themselves, which you do not particularly care about as there are greater riches for you to claim as your own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_182;Riches untold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_185;You have been on the road for quite some time, and at times it felt as if you never might see your home again, but eventually you start to recognize some familiar landmarks. Quickening your pace, you manage to travel the remaining distance before night falls once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_185;Home at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DRAGONSLAYER_JOINS_THE_PARTY;[new_dragonslayer.GetBestName] joins your party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DRAGONSLAYERS_JOIN_THE_PARTY;[new_dragonslayer.GetBestName] and [new_dragonslayer_2.GetBestName] join your party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_DRAGON_190;The Knight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_190;One day while you are on the road an armored man comes riding towards you, moving slowly and openly in a manner that is clearly meant to indicate that he does not wish you any harm.\n\n"I am [new_dragonslayer.GetBestName]," he proclaims. "I have been told that you seek the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, and would stand by your side as you face this foe, my [Root.GetLordLady]!"\n\nIt is up to you whether you wish to accept this offer, but it is likely that it will be easier to slay the dragon with more people in your party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_190;I accept your fealty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_190;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_DRAGON_191;The Knight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_191;As you are breaking camp one day an armed woman approaches your encampment, moving with purpose but making certain that you and your companions can see her coming.\n\n"My [Root.GetLordLady], I have heard rumours that you plan to face Fredak, the Emperor of Embers," she tells you when she has come closer. "If you would let me accompany you, it would be an honor to fight by your side."\n\nIt is up to you whether you wish to accept this offer, but it is likely that it will be easier to slay the dragon with more people in your party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_191;The honor would be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_191;I don't need you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_DRAGON_192;The Crusader;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_192;One evening while you and your companions are having a meal in a tavern an enormous man clad in ornate armor enters through the door. He spots your party and heads over to you.\n\n"I hear you seek the dragon," he says excitedly. "Allow me to join you, and I would fight by your side so that we might live with honor, or die with glory!" It almost sounds like the latter excites him more.\n\nIt is up to you whether you wish to accept this offer, but it is likely that it will be easier to slay the dragon with more people in your party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_192;I like the way you think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_192;Go away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_DRAGON_193;The Crusader and the Shieldmaiden;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_193;As you leave the inn where you have been sleeping one morning you are approached by two people, one of them a very large old man and the other a young and fairly muscular woman who looks tiny in comparison.\n\n"We would join your quest," the man says. "I would be your shield."\n\n"And I would do my best to keep you all safe," the woman adds.\n\nIt is up to you whether you wish to accept this offer, but it is likely that it will be easier to slay the dragon with more people in your party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_193;Two at once? Why not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_193;Your presence is unwanted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_DRAGON_194;The Huntress;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_194;A woman approaches you one day on the road, wearing light armor and carrying a bow that you suspect that she knows how to use. Judging by the look she gives some of your companions, she at least does not think highly of them.\n\n"I have heard that you are hunting a dragon," she says. "If you promise you will not be asking me to carry your burdens, I would gladly join you."\n\nIt is up to you whether you wish to accept this offer, but it is likely that it will be easier to slay the dragon with more people in your party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_194;No carrying necessary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_194;I don't want you with me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_DRAGON_195;The Goliath;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_195;One of your guards begs a moment of your time one evening while you are about to retire for the night and brings over an incredibly large man.\n\n"I am [new_dragonslayer.GetName]," the big man says. "I have been waiting...," he pauses to count on his fingers "...three days for you to come here. I want to fight the dragon with you!"\n\nIt is up to you whether you wish to accept this offer, but it is likely that it will be easier to slay the dragon with more people in your party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_195;I could use your strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_195;Please go away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_DRAGON_196;The Zealot;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_196;A rider approaches you one day on the road, clad in armor bearing a noticeable amount of Christian iconography. The [new_dragonslayer.GetManWoman] brings [new_dragonslayer.GetHerHis] horse to a halt near yours and takes off [new_dragonslayer.GetHerHis] helmet before speaking.\n\n"I am [new_dragonslayer.GetBestName]," the [new_dragonslayer.GetManWoman] proclaims. "In Saint George's name, I would stand with you."\n\nIt is up to you whether you wish to accept this offer, but it is likely that it will be easier to slay the dragon with more people in your party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_196;I welcome your aid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_196;I don't need a zealot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_DRAGON_197;The Glorious;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_197;As you are passing through a small market village a handsome man comes up to you, clearly happy to see you as he has a big smile on his face.\n\n"Ah, you have arrived!" he exclaims. "Allow me to introduce myself. I am [new_dragonslayer.GetBestName], and I wish to join you on your quest to the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers. That dreadful beast must be stopped."\n\nIt is up to you whether you wish to accept this offer, but it is likely that it will be easier to slay the dragon with more people in your party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_197;Your company would be enjoyable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_197;I have no need of you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_DRAGON_198;The Dwarf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_198;In one village along the route you are travelling on your way to the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, you come across a dwarf, who introduces himself as [new_dragonslayer.GetBestName].\n\n"The dragon killed my kinsmen and stole our treasures," he tells you. "I would join you on your quest to avenge the former and recover the latter."\n\nIt is up to you whether you wish to accept this offer, but it is likely that it will be easier to slay the dragon with more people in your party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_198;You will have your chance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_198;Get lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_DRAGON_199;The Charming;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_199;One day while you are having a meal by the roadside a handsome man armored in a suit of armor that is very decorated rides up to you. Judging by his posture, he thinks rather highly of himself.\n\n"I have heard you wish to slay a dragon," the man tells you, half-speaking and half-singing. "I wish to join you on your quest. Dragoslaying is what I do best!\n\nIt is up to you whether you wish to accept this offer, but it is likely that it will be easier to slay the dragon with more people in your party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_199;You may accompany me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_199;I don't want your help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_DRAGON_200;The Wyld;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_200;One evening you are approached by a man introducing himself as [new_dragonslayer.GetBestName], who claims that he has heard about your quest.\n\n"Allow me to offer my services," he says. "I am better than the dragon. I have always been better than the dragon, and I will prove it to him, and to everyone." Something seems a tad suspect about the man, but you cannot tell what it is.\n\nIt is up to you whether you wish to accept this offer, but it is likely that it will be easier to slay the dragon with more people in your party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_200;Your aid is welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DRAGON_200;Leave my presence at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_DRAGON_201;The Black Arrow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DRAGON_201;A man wearing fairly simple clothes and carrying a bow approaches your party one day and introduces himself as [new_dragonslayer.GetBestName], with the epithet being rather unusual for a peasant.\n\n"A little bird told me that you are hunting Fredak, the Emperor of Embers," he says. "I agree that the beast must be slain, and I would join you if you wuld have me. I know how to handle myself in a fight."\n\nIt is up to you whether you wish to accept this offer, but it is likely that it will be easier to slay the dragon with more people in your party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DRAGON_201;Peasant or no, you can come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Moreover, if you would have me, I would gladly join you on your quest."\n\nIt is up to you whether you wish to accept this offer, but it is likely that it will be easier to slay the dragon with more people in your party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_JAPAN_406;The population in [Root.GetName] has long had its share of seafarers, but of late many of them have seen fit to change their ways from mostly peaceful fishing to more aggressive raiding. Though they have yet to organize any raids worth speaking of, it is likely that it only is a matter of time before one or more of the captains decides to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_406;That is not ideal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_406;As well they should!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_407;The Wako population in [Root.GetName] has long been involved in small-scale raiding, but it has not been something that has been extensive enough that it has been more than a footnote. However, several influential pirate captains now consider the province their home, and they are actively recruiting sailors and spending their ill-gotten gains in port.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_407;They'd better not raid my coasts...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_408;The more influential pirate captains that once called [Root.GetName] their home have moved their operations elsewhere, and though there might still be a few pirates left in the province that is no more than what would be expected of any coastal province. Maybe this is only a temporary reprieve, or maybe the days of piracy are over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_408;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_408;I have my own raiders...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_409;The Wako pirates in [wako_province.GetName] grow bolder. One of the most influential captains, [wako_raider.GetBestName], has seen fit to assemble a large force of ships and raiders, and now seeks fame and fortune on the seas. Supposedly, [wako_raider.GetSheHe] will only raid abroad, but that might change in the future...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_409;Be gone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_409;Leave, and do not return!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_410;Your band of Wako pirates has served you well for many years, but though your raids have been relatively successfully the time has come for you to part ways. Hopefully the gold you have earned will be enough for anything you might wish to purchase. If not, maybe you will need to gather another crew and set forth on another series of raids.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_JURCHEN_11;Peace in our time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JURCHEN_12;I have received word that [From.GetBestName] is unwilling to enter into a non-aggression pact with me.

EVTDESC_SOH_5707;My vassal, [From.GetBestName], has refused to mourn his ancestor for the period demanded of him by our culture. Tradition demands that I take action... perhaps a demotion and a stay in the dungeon will remind him of his duties of filial piety?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5707;It certainly would!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5707;I literally don't care...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5708;I am sitting around in my family mansion one day when one of my servants approaches me timidly. "My [Root.GetLordLady]," he stammers out. "People on the street are doubting your filial piety. Perhaps you should emulate the ancients and live in a shack by your ancestors' graves to show your devotion?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5708;Sure, I will make the preparations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5708;Live in a what? Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5709;I see my servants whispering to each other whenever I order my meal to be served up. Although I have reduced the opulence of my meals, it seems that they think the reductions I have made are insufficient and only for show. Perhaps I should do something to rectify that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5709;I will eat even less from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5709;Why do I even bother with the diet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5710;As expected of a mourning child, I wear white clothes made of hemp. However, I find it uncomfortable compared to my normal silks and finery. Perhaps a little lapse from mourning traditions would be welcome here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5710;No one will care about a small slip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5710;My clothes show my filial piety!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5711;Due to my grief I have neglected caring for my appearance. My hair is dishevelled and those around me have begun to gossip that I might be too absorbed in my grief to care for myself properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5711;I will fix my hair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5711;It would be improper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5712;It is customary to mourn the dead with offerings of incense and paper money, as well as cleaning up their grave site. I could spend some money on offerings for my recently deceased ancestor, and it would be the pious thing to do, but then again, money is money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5712;I will buy incense to burn before their now-cleaned graves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5712;That sounds like a waste of money and time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5713;Some say that the dead never truly leave us, and that the living can commune with them if the correct rites and rituals are used. While this is dismissed by orthodox scholars as nothing but fanciful superstition, after the loss of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] I am much more tempted to believe in such things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5713;It is worth investigating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5713;I am no fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5714;After weeks of dedicated study, I have finally mastered the ritual. At my command, the spirit of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] appears before me. It is just like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHe] is alive again, and we converse for hours until my power is exhausted and [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHe] has to depart once more. It is like a weight has been lifted from my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5714;Until we meet again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5715;After weeks of dedicated study, I am forced to conclude that my research has reached a dead end. None of the rituals I attempt come close to bringing me to a reunion with [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName], and perhaps no such ritual exists at all. Will I truly never see [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim] again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5715;I have learnt much about the occult, at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5716;After the death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName], I find myself drifting around, bereft of all motivation. Grief is at least something that I can understand, but this crushing emptiness is beyond grief, sapping all of my drive and desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5716;Is there truly nothing left for me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5717;While the days of mourning are a time of grief, for me, they have also proven to be a welcome respite from the struggles of everyday life. The requirement of abstinence from almost all other actions has given me time to relax and let out some of my pent-up stress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5717;A time for relaxation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5718;While the days of mourning have allowed me to relax and relief myself of some stress, it has also caused me to regard my work with less importance. After all, it feels so much better not diligently hammering away at every detail on those official papers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5718;Diligence is overrated anyways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5718;No! I must not allow myself to become lazy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5719;While I have chosen to follow a different faith from [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName], [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] blood still flows through my veins. Perhaps I should try to understand [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] faith, and thus [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim], a little better?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5719;It is part of my heritage, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5719;I must not lose sight of my own faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5720;I am a high-ranking official, and I should certainly have the resources to dedicate a large offering of food and wealth to the spirit of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName]. However, while pious, such large offerings are seen as arrogant and unbecoming of a mourning child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5720;Go ahead with the offering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5720;No, it would just be a show of pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5721;[also_mourning_relative.GetBestName], is also in mourning. Having just lost a close  relative, I can understand [also_mourning_relative.GetHerHis] pain. Perhaps I should approach [also_mourning_relative.GetHerHim] and offer my sympathies? It could be an opportunity to improve our relationship by sharing our grief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5721;I will write [also_mourning_relative.GetHerHim] a letter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5721;I won't want to bother [also_mourning_relative.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5722;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetBestName], has just written me a letter consoling me on my recent loss. This could certainly be an opportunity to strengthen our relationship, but at the same time [From.GetSheHe] is remarkably forward and [From.GetHerHis] letter could be represented as an attempt to rub salt into my wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5722;I will reciprocate [From.GetHerHis] kindness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5722;I will rebuff [From.GetHerHis] attempts at commiseration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5723;I have received a positive response from [From.GetBestName]. It seems that my sympathies were received and appreciated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5723;As a fellow mourner, [From.GetSheHe] knows my pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5724;I have received a strongly worded response from [From.GetBestName], informing me that [From.GetSheHe] has no wish to speak with me. [From.GetSheHeCap] tells me in no uncertain terms to mind my own business and leave [From.GetHerHim] to [From.GetHerHis] grief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5724;I just wanted to help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5726;In recent days, I have found myself more and more paralysed by the thought of death. The death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] has reminded me that no one is immortal, and it seems that fear of my own death has finally caught up with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5726;Anyone could be plotting to kill me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5726;I must accept this looming inevitability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5726;I will face my fears head-on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5727;In recent days, I have found myself thinking about death. The death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] has reminded me that no one has unlimited time, and I must strive to accomplish something soon before my death if I wish to be remembered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5727;I will redouble my efforts and strive for excellence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5727;My legacy will speak for itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5727;Perhaps it is time to think about curbing my ambition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5728;In recent days, I have found myself becoming more friendly towards others. The death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] has reminded me that we are all merely residing temporarily in this world, and perhaps I should be kinder to my fellow lodgers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5728;I could help others with my wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5728;I should set aside more time for those around me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5728;Kindness is a weakness within myself that I must root out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5729;In recent days, I have found myself humbled by the enormity of death. The death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] has reminded me that status in this world means nothing before mortality, and in the end our fates are subject to greater powers than our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5729;I shall devote myself to the higher powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5729;I must rule justly to be treated justly in turn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5729;Or maybe I am the highest power there is?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5730;In recent days, I have found myself doubting the benevolence of the world more and more. The death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] has reminded me of the cruelty of the world. In this unkind world, I must decide how to adapt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5730;There is truly no such thing as justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5730;I cannot be wrong if there is no right and wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5730;It does not make sense, but I must accept it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5731;In recent days, I have found myself growing even more distant from those around me. The death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] has reminded me of the pain of loss, and I do not wish to subject myself to that ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5731;I will never love again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5731;I must harden my heart and turn away from kindness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5731;I cannot isolate myself forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5732;I am not coping well with the death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName]. While I tried to hold myself together at first, I found myself growing ever more irritable, snapping at everyone around me. I just couldn't cope with all of it-;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5732;HAHAHA! WHAT A JOKE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5734;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] great virility and eagerness for sexual activity. Although some would say that such inclinations are not to be praised, Confucius does say that the filial son should not deviate from his father's ways...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5734;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5734;Lust is a sin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5735;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] voracious appetite and love of fine foods. While some scholars say that such excesses are to be condemned, [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] eating habits did keep [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim] well-fed and healthy. Perhaps I should seek to emulate [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] appetite?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5735;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5735;Gluttony is a sin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5736;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] great love for money, in particular [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] great love for hoarding money and never spending it. It certainly cannot be denied that [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHe] died a wealthy [ancestor_to_mourn.GetManWoman], and I should certainly emulate [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim] if I wish to do the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5736;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5736;Money only has value when spent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5737;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for caring little for the burdens of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] position, ignoring [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] obligations in favour of a carefree life. While diligence is certainly important, I wonder whether emulating [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] attitude would make me a happier person...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5737;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5737;My role requires my diligence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5738;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for being fast to anger and not letting anyone cross [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim] without consequences. While [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHe] certainly lacked control, no one dared to cross [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim], and perhaps I should emulate [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] behaviour to ensure that I am equally as feared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5738;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5738;I must control my more negative emotions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5739;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] strong envy towards anyone doing better than [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim]. While scholars condemn [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim] for envy, surely wishing to be better than others is a good thing that I should emulate?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5739;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5739;I must not let jealousy consume me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5740;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] pride in [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] accomplishments, often showing off and bragging to others. I myself have had many accomplishments in my life, and perhaps I should emulate [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] pride and confidence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5740;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5740;Despite my accomplishments, I should remain humble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5741;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] distaste for carnal activities.

The scholars speak well of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] actions in curbing the excesses of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] meals, and some have hinted to me that it is something I should emulate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5742;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5742;I do not wish to starve myself for show.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5743;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] great generosity, having spent much of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] own money helping people around [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim].

EVTOPTA_SOH_5743;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5743;My money will be used for my own good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5744;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] diligence. Scholars speak fondly of the effort [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHe] put into [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] official duties, and many are subtly hinting to me that perhaps this is something I should try and emulate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5744;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5744;I can't be bothered to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5745;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] patience towards everyone around [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim]. The scholars say that [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHe] never once lost [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] temper, and perhaps that is something I should seek to emulate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5745;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5745;Patience? Don't make me laugh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SOH_5746;Kindness will only lead to hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5747;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for remaining quiet and humble throughout [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] life, never showing off [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] accomplishments. The scholars, who appear to tire of my constant bragging, have not-so-subtly hinted that perhaps I should emulate [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5747;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5747;I will stop bragging when I am in the grave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SOH_5748;I am happy with my current status.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5749;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for having no regard for the law and making decisions as [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHe] saw fit. While the scholars speak ill of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim] for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] disregard for legal traditions, they have also been reminding me that a filial son does not deviate from his father's ways...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5749;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5749;I will be more just than my ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5750;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for never letting fear rule [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] decisions. [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHisCap] courage is certainly something of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHersHis] that would be beneficial for me to emulate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_5759;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for being careful around anyone [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHe] did not trust, which was a truly extensive list of people.

EVTOPTB_SOH_5759;To distrust everyone sounds lonely indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5760;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for avoiding contact with others as much as possible and secluding [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerselfHimself]. While it has certainly hurt [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] social relations, perhaps there is something in [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] behaviour that is worthy of my emulation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5760;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
