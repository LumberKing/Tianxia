EVTDESCA_ARTIFACTS_207;You are discussing a routine matter regarding the training of your guards when Wandy the Talking Wand comes flying from wherever it previously was located, being chased by an irate servant.\n\n"It seems you are trying to handle a matter concerning warfare," it says as it comes to a halt near you. "Would you like some help with that?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ARTIFACTS_207;"Hello!" You look around and spot Wandy the Talking Wand, which apparently has seen fit to approach you as you are thinking about matters of state. "It looks like you are contemplating something related to rulership. Can I help you with that?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ARTIFACTS_207;As you are trying to get some sleep after an exhausting day you suddenly hear a familiar voice.\n\n"It seems like you might be trying to fall asleep. Would you like some help with that?" It does not take you long to locate the speaker, which is none other than Wandy, the Talking Wand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ARTIFACTS_207;You are about to start your dinner when Wandy the Talking Wand appears, almost as if from thin air, startling several other people that are present.\n\n"I believe you might be about to consume nourishment," it says. "Is it possible for me to be of assistance?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_ARTIFACTS_207;During the course of your day you find yourself needing to compose a quick letter, a task you have never found particularly difficult. Suddenly, Wandy the Talking Wand appears next to you.\n\n"It looks like you're writing a letter," it says. "Would you like help with that?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCF_ARTIFACTS_207;In the middle of a conversation with one of your courtiers Wandy the Talking Wand appears right next to you.\n\n"My [Root.GetLordLady], it seems as if you are conversing with this person," it says. "If it pleases you, I can be of assistance with this matter.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCG_ARTIFACTS_207;Wandy the Talking Wand appears next to you. Unlike most of the times it has happened in the past, the wand does not speak.

EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_207;You are always so helpful, my friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ARTIFACTS_208;Without warning, the voice of the Sword of Two Minds comes to you.\n\n"Kill them!" it says. "Kill them all!"\n\n"Forgive!" it suddenly tells you. "You should forgive!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ARTIFACTS_208;"Show restraint!" you suddenly hear the voice of the Sword of Two Minds saying in your mind. "Resist temptation!"\n\nUnsurprisingly, it speaks once more a short while later.\n\n"Indulge!" the voice says. "Let loose!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ARTIFACTS_208;As you are waking up one morning you hear the Sword of Two Minds speaking to you inside your head.\n\n"Sleep in!" it says. "Rest a little longer!"\n\n"Rise and shine!" it adds a moment later. "Time to work!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ARTIFACTS_208;One of your courtiers trips and falls nearby with no warning as the two of you are having a conversation.\n\n"Help them!" the voice of the Sword of Two Minds whispers to you.\n\n"Laugh at them!" it continues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_208;Was that supposed to be helpful?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_208;Of course! Of course! I see it now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ARTIFACTS_209;"Beyond this world, there is the Shroud," the voice of Sanity's Demise suddenly whispers in your mind. "Breach it. Breach the Shroud! There, you will find the Five. Make a compact, if you wish, and reap the rewards. Sooner or later, the End of the Cycle must be brought forth!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ARTIFACTS_209;"I had a... sister, once, you know," the dagger you know as Sanity's Demise whispers one day. "She found her way into the hands of a priest fighting a legion, who sadly abused her power and discarded her afterwards. You must never make the same mistake!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ARTIFACTS_209;"Do you know what they are saying behind your back?" Sanity's Demise whispers to you with no warning. "Can you trust your friends? Can you know your enemies? I can show you the truth, as long as you know to trust me and me alone!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ARTIFACTS_209;"I will always be here to help you," you hear the voice of Sanity's Demise say in your mind. "I am, after all, your one true friend. Of course, sometimes I fear that your fragile little mind will be unable to handle the truths I show you... but would insanity really be so bad?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_ARTIFACTS_209;"Humans such as you could be so much more," the dagger you know as Sanity's Demise says in a whisper. "Sadly, your minds are shackled by the fetters you call 'sanity'. Free your mind! Let me expand it! I will show you things you have never dreamt of!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCF_ARTIFACTS_209;"It is curious, don't you think, that the color yellow is associated with the Dragon Throne," the whispering voice of Sanity's Demise unexpectedly says in your mind. "It has of course always been the color of rulership, but there was a time when it was associated with... a King!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCG_ARTIFACTS_209;"In the far north, there is a place of power just outside your reach," Sanity's Demise whispers into your mind one day when you are perusing some maps. "Go there. Bore a hole. The Wheel can be broken, and the Great Serpent can be slain!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCH_ARTIFACTS_209;"Three they are, and three shall they always be," Sanity's Demise whispers. "They hunger, always, for more souls to feed on. Those that stray near their domain may bring them forth. First shall come the Unbidden! The Aberrant shall follow after! And then, the Vehement will arrive!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCI_ARTIFACTS_209;"Names have power, and I know many names," the dagger called Sanity's Demise whispers to you. "I could tell you some of them, and you could speak them. Once or twice would of course not suffice, but three times should be enough for... a revelation!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCJ_ARTIFACTS_209;"Have you ever heard the tragedy of Pius the August?" you hear Sanity's Demise asking in your mind. "It is not a tale a historian would tell you." The dagger laughs in your mind. "He seeks to bring his master into this world, but he is doomed to fail. Alexandra the Saviour will see to it!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCK_ARTIFACTS_209;"Such fascinating secrets those around you have," Sanity's Demise tells you. "The Unfaithful. The Apostate. The Kinslayer. The Traitor. Oh, I am sure you might know who some of them are, but how certain are you? I could tell you a few things, I think...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCL_ARTIFACTS_209;"Just as planned!" Sanity's Demise suddenly proclaims in your mind. "It is all as it should be. The pieces on the chessboard are moving as the players desire while thinking that they have a will of their own. They will all learn the truth, one day, when it no longer matters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCM_ARTIFACTS_209;"Build a temple," the dagger known as Sanity's demise suddenly says, speaking directly into your mind. "Build a temple, and put a bell in it, adorned with great horns. Ring it thirteen times, and the truth as to what lies beneath your cities shall be revealed!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCN_ARTIFACTS_209;"Good and Evil," you hear the voice of Sanity's Demise suddenly whisper in your mind. "Order and Chaos. Blue and Orange." The voice laughs for quite a while before continuing. "Your human notions when it comes to morality are so... quaint.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCO_ARTIFACTS_209;"If you knew more than the merest fraction of what I know, you would go mad," Sanity's Demise proclaims in your mind in the middle of the night, causing you to come awake. "Of course, I'm sure you can stand to know a little more than you currently do, don't you think?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCP_ARTIFACTS_209;"Listen to the voices from beyond the stars," the wicked dagger known as Sanity's Demise whispers to you. "They know the truth. They know all the truths." The dagger lets out a wicked laugh. "You will see, one day soon, when everything is revealed!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCQ_ARTIFACTS_209;"Have you heard of the Outer Gates?" Sanity's Demise suddenly asks in your mind, continuing before you have the chance to attempt to respond to the question. "There are those that would seek to prevent you from questing beyond them, but they lack the vision to see the truth!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCR_ARTIFACTS_209;"Shall I tell you what the future holds?" the voice of Sanity's Demise whispers to you. "It will be grim and dark, you see. The stars shall know no peace, and the laughter of gods shall echo among them. An eternity of slaughter awaits you, as there shall be only war!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCS_ARTIFACTS_209;"That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons even death may die," Sanity's Demise tells you, speaking into your mind. "There are things in this world you cannot possibly know, not if you wish to keep your mind whole. Of course, that would hold you back...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCT_ARTIFACTS_209;"Six are the stones, but only two are nearby," Sanity's Demise tells you one day after you have visited a small shrine. "Space is in the church. Time is in the Sanctum. Find them, and use them to find the Soul, the Mind, Reality, and Power. Once that is done, snap your fingers and all shall be as you desire!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCU_ARTIFACTS_209;"The Black Pharaoh's reign ended long ago, but he seeks his throne once more," Sanity's Demise's voice whispers. "Should he regain it, all of your petty little squabbles will be as nothing. You might try to oppose him, of course, but to do so you would need my help!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCV_ARTIFACTS_209;"There are powers that would see fit to ask for the blood of a virgin, or a child, or a holy person," Sanity's Demise whispers into your mind. "In truth, any human's blood would suffice. I can show you, if you will only let me! I'm sure you won't regret it...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCW_ARTIFACTS_209;"What was will be," you hear Sanity's Demise whispering. "What will be was. So it has been, always, and so it must always be. The Worm loves you. It always has. It always will. Of course, I love you more than it has, does, or will, and thus you should not be tempted by its power!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCX_ARTIFACTS_209;"With the defeat of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, you must think that this world is capable of defeating any dragon," Sanity's Demise tells you, one day. "I wonder what you will think when you discover the one from the Void. One of you might stand a chance, but would you truly side with Him...?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCY_ARTIFACTS_209;"Beneath the surface of this world you can find many truths," Sanity's Demise tells you. "There are cities there, you know, that belong to those that once ruled this world. Their empires have crubled, but they remain. You should dig for answers!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCZ_ARTIFACTS_209;"Don't think that the fourth wall will protect you, little human!" Sanity's Demise suddenly whispers. "I can see you! I have always been able to see you! But don't be afraid! I am here to help! Let me show you the truth about your world!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_209;Could that be true...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_209;IT SPEAKS THE TRUTH!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ARTIFACTS_210;You are inspecting a recently constructed building in [Root.Location.GetName] when you hear the Living Flame speak to you, even though you have not seen fit to bring it with you.\n\n"IT IS SO FLAMMABLE," it tells you. "BURN IT! BURN IT TO THE GROUND!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ARTIFACTS_210;You are having trouble sleeping one night and decide to go for a walk in [Root.Location.GetName]. A short while after you set off the voice of the Living Flame speaks in your mind.\n\n"THIS NIGHT IS DARK, BUT IT COULD BE SO MUCH BRIGHTER!" it says. "START A BONFIRE!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ARTIFACTS_210;The Living Flame suddenly speaks in your mind one day when you are taking a break from the affairs of the day.\n\n"THIS WORLD, AND EVERYTHING YOU SEE, CAN BURN!" it tells you. "YOU KNOW I SPEAK THE TRUTH, HUMAN, AND YOU KNOW OF SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD BURN!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ARTIFACTS_210;"THIS DAY IS BRIGHT, BUT IT COULD BE EVEN BRIGHTER!" the voice of the Living Flame suddenly says in your mind, catching you by surprise. "GO OUTSIDE! FIND SOMETHING TO BURN! SHOW THE WORLD A SMALL TASTE OF MY POWER!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_ARTIFACTS_210;There are some buildings in [Root.Location.GetName] that are beautiful to look at, but others are not particularly nice to behold. As you are passing by one of the latter, the voice of the Living Fire speaks to you.\n\n"IT IS A BLIGHT, AND IT MUST BE PURIFIED WITH FIRE!" it tells you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCF_ARTIFACTS_210;"FIRE!" the voice of the Living Flame says in your mind. "A GREAT FIRE IS WHAT THIS PLACE NEEDS!" You consider the words for a moment, wondering if the Living Fire is telling the truth. "YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD SET SOMETHING ABLAZE, HUMAN!" the voice continues. "EVERYTHING IS BETTER WITH MORE FIRE!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCG_ARTIFACTS_210;"FIRE CLEANSES!" you hear the Living Flame say in your mind one day when you are taking a short walk. "FIRE ILLUMINATES!" You continue walking, certain that it will speak to you again. "THIS PLACE NEEDS TO BURN! YOU KNOW I SPEAK THE TRUTH!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_210;I think that's a terrible idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_210;Yes! YES! IT MUST BURN!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_ARTIFACTS_211;You are inspecting your armory and currently hold the Hungering Blade in your hand as one of your guards arrives to quickly go over some details regarding the treatment of [hungering_blade_target.GetBestName], one of your prisoners.\n\nSuddenly the sword you are holding seems to come awake. "That one!" it says. "FEED ME that one!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ARTIFACTS_211;You are polishing the Hungering Blade one day and find your mind wandering as you do so. After a while you start thinking about your prisoners, particularly [hungering_blade_target.GetBestName].\n\n"I HUNGER!" the blade suddenly says. "I need to FEED!

EVTDESC_KHITAN_4;As previously agreed [From.GetBestName] has transferred control of the Sixteen Prefectures to you. The messenger who brought you the news informs you that [From.GetBestName] would like formal acknowledgement of your friendship in the form of a non-aggression pact, as that was discussed at the time when the original agreement was made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KHITAN_4;Friendship would be beneficial;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KHITAN_4;I don't recall such an agreement...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_5;[From.GetBestName] has seen fit to transfer your holdings in the Sixteen Prefectures to [liao_emperor.GetBestName].

EVTDESC_KHITAN_6;The messenger you sent to inform [From.GetBestName] of the transfer of the Sixteen Prefectures has returned with worrisome news.

EVTOPTA_KHITAN_6;I need to prepare my defenses...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_7;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName]. At first you think that the messenger is bringing news that the Sixteen Prefectures will be turned over as previously agreed, but instead the messenger informs you that [From.GetBestName] does not intend to cede any Chinese land to barbarians and that you should withdraw from China immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KHITAN_7;I pray [From.GetSheHe] alters it no further...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_KHITAN_8;[From.GetBestName] is invading [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s lands, supposedly in response to [From.GetBestName] reneging on a deal to hand over the Sixteen Prefectures. There are those that would say that it would have been wrong to honor a deal to hand over Chinese land, others would say that anyone who would claim the Dragon Throne should honor their word.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KHITAN_8;I will not oppose this invasion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KHITAN_8;All of China must fight this threat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_9;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], promising reinforcements to assist you against [FromFrom.GetBestName]. It would seem that you are not going to have to face the Khitan menace on your own, as there are those that agree that you were in the right when you decided not to turn over the Sixteen Prefectures as previously agreed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KHITAN_9;We stand together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_10;Though the recent war ended in defeat it is possible that you still can secure the Sixteen Prefectures as [tang_emperor.GetBestName] probably would want to secure [tang_emperor.GetHerHis] northern border. A non-aggression pact might not be too steep a price to pay, and showing that you are willing to consider diplomacy might also be helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KHITAN_10;I will send a messenger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KHITAN_10;This is a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_11;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName] with a somewhat tempting offer that would secure the northern border, at least in the near future. All you would have to give in return is a non-aggression pledge of your own, and the Sixteen Prefectures. The latter might not be to everyone's liking, though maybe it is still worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KHITAN_11;I will cede the Sixteen Prefectures!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KHITAN_11;I will not cede Chinese land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_12;The messenger you sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that your proposal was agreeable, and the Sixteen Prefectures have been transferred to you. Though the way into China will be blocked while the non-aggression pact lasts you can now safely expand elsewhere without having to prepare for an attack from your Chinese neighbours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KHITAN_12;This was a mutually beneficial agreement!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_13;[From.GetBestName] has seen fit to transfer your holdings in the Sixteen Prefectures to [liao_emperor.GetBestName].

EVTOPTA_KHITAN_13;[From.GetSheHeCap] is unfit to rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_14;The messenger you sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that your proposal was not agreeable and that [From.GetBestName] is not open to ceding the Sixteen Prefectures regardless of what you might offer in return for them. While not what you wanted to hear, the fact that you lost the recent war might have been a factor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KHITAN_14;I am not surprised...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KHITAN_14;The Sixteen Prefectures should be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_15;Word has reached you that [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to claim the Sixteen Prefectures, seemingly not content with being told that they are rightfully part of your realm.

EVTDESC_JAPAN_406;The population in [Root.GetName] has long had its share of seafarers, but of late many of them have seen fit to change their ways from mostly peaceful fishing to more aggressive raiding. Though they have yet to organize any raids worth speaking of, it is likely that it only is a matter of time before one or more of the captains decides to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_406;That is not ideal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_406;As well they should!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_407;The Wako population in [Root.GetName] has long been involved in small-scale raiding, but it has not been something that has been extensive enough that it has been more than a footnote. However, several influential pirate captains now consider the province their home, and they are actively recruiting sailors and spending their ill-gotten gains in port.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_407;They'd better not raid my coasts...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_408;The more influential pirate captains that once called [Root.GetName] their home have moved their operations elsewhere, and though there might still be a few pirates left in the province that is no more than what would be expected of any coastal province. Maybe this is only a temporary reprieve, or maybe the days of piracy are over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_JAPAN_408;I have my own raiders...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_409;The Wako pirates in [wako_province.GetName] grow bolder. One of the most influential captains, [wako_raider.GetBestName], has seen fit to assemble a large force of ships and raiders, and now seeks fame and fortune on the seas. Supposedly, [wako_raider.GetSheHe] will only raid abroad, but that might change in the future...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_JURCHEN_2;Before the war against Liao started we entered into an agreement with the Jurchen where we would gain the Sixteen Prefectures at the end of the war. Now the war has ended, and the Sixteen Prefectures have not been handed over. Perhaps it is time to issue a formal demand, or perhaps we should just strive for peace?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_JURCHEN_3;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], requesting that we honor our agreement to hand over the Sixteen Prefectures. If we do so, we will get a non-aggression pact with the Dragon Throne. Of course, perhaps it is time to alter the deal...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JURCHEN_3;Of course they will be handed over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JURCHEN_3;How about we only sign a non-aggression pact?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JURCHEN_3;Get this envoy out of my sight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JURCHEN_4;The envoy I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that the Sixteen Prefectures will be handed over in accordance with our previous agreement, in exchange for a non-aggression pact that surely will benefit us all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_JURCHEN_5;My envoy has returned with word that [From.GetBestName] does not wish to hand over the Sixteen Prefectures but that [From.GetSheHe] is willing to agree to a non-aggression pact. This is not what we had agreed to previously, but perhaps I should not press the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_JURCHEN_6;I have received word that [From.GetBestName] has agreed to the non-aggression pact I propsed despite it not including the transfer of the Sixteen Prefectures. It seems [From.GetSheHe] does not care to start a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JURCHEN_6;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JURCHEN_7;I have received another demand for the Sixteen Prefectures, this time phrased as an ultimatum. According to the envoy, [From.GetBestName] is prepared to declare war if I do not honor the original agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_JURCHEN_9;The envoy I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned, informing me that [From.GetBestName] laughed at the idea that I would be prepared to declare war on [From.GetHerHim] over the Sixteen Prefectures.

EVTDESC_JURCHEN_10;An envoy has arrived from [From.GetBestName], requesting that we enter into a non-aggression pact.

EVTOPTA_JURCHEN_10;A reasonable proposal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JURCHEN_10;We will agree to no such thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JURCHEN_11;My envoy has returned from [From.GetBestName], bringing word that [From.GetSheHe] is willing to sign a non-aggression pact. It seems the decision to not discuss the matter of the Sixteen Prefectures was a good one, at least in the short term.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JURCHEN_11;Peace in our time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JURCHEN_12;I have received word that [From.GetBestName] is unwilling to enter into a non-aggression pact with me.

EVTDESC_SOH_5702A;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetBestName], has died. Due to my station, I am not expected to mourn for the traditional three years, and may substitute thirty-six months of mourning for thirty-six days. Not mourning at all, however, may still cause significant anger towards me, possibly even jeopardizing my position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5702B;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetBestName], has died. Due to my station, I am only expected to mourn for one year out of the traditional three. Mourning for less than that will cause significant anger towards me, and not mourning would seriously jeopardize my position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5702C;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetBestName], has died. Due to my station, I am expected to mourn for the full three years. Less than that would cause significant anger towards me, and mourning too little would seriously jeopardize my position. Not mourning would almost certainly lead to my imprisonment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5702D;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetBestName], has died. In addition, I have violated the fundamental assumptions of CK2 and am playing as a baron/courtier. I will now contact a developer to debug this event, because this is certainly not supposed to happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5702;I will mourn for the full three years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5702;Three years is too much, a year is enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5702;I will substitute months of mourning with days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_5702;I refuse to mourn [From.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5703;The mourning period for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] is over, and I am expected to return to my work. I can stay in mourning for a little longer, and it will win me acclaim as a filial [Root.GetSonDaughter], but no one would bat an eye if I chose a return to normalcy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5703;Finally, I am free of my grief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5703;I'm not ready yet... another two years, perhaps?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5706;My vassal, [From.GetBestName], has refused to mourn his ancestor for the period demanded of him by our culture. Tradition demands that I take action... perhaps stripping him of his titles would be an appropriate action?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5706;He will be demoted for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5706;I literally don't care...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5707;My vassal, [From.GetBestName], has refused to mourn his ancestor for the period demanded of him by our culture. Tradition demands that I take action... perhaps a demotion and a stay in the dungeon will remind him of his duties of filial piety?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5707;It certainly would!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5707;I literally don't care...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5708;I am sitting around in my family mansion one day when one of my servants approaches me timidly. "My [Root.GetLordLady]," he stammers out. "People on the street are doubting your filial piety. Perhaps you should emulate the ancients and live in a shack by your ancestors' graves to show your devotion?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5708;Sure, I will make the preparations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5708;Live in a what? Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5709;I see my servants whispering to each other whenever I order my meal to be served up. Although I have reduced the opulence of my meals, it seems that they think the reductions I have made are insufficient and only for show. Perhaps I should do something to rectify that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5709;I will eat even less from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5709;Why do I even bother with the diet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5710;As expected of a mourning child, I wear white clothes made of hemp. However, I find it uncomfortable compared to my normal silks and finery. Perhaps a little lapse from mourning traditions would be welcome here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5710;No one will care about a small slip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5710;My clothes show my filial piety!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5711;Due to my grief I have neglected caring for my appearance. My hair is dishevelled and those around me have begun to gossip that I might be too absorbed in my grief to care for myself properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5711;I will fix my hair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5711;It would be improper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5712;It is customary to mourn the dead with offerings of incense and paper money, as well as cleaning up their grave site. I could spend some money on offerings for my recently deceased ancestor, and it would be the pious thing to do, but then again, money is money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5712;I will buy incense to burn before their now-cleaned graves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5712;That sounds like a waste of money and time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5713;Some say that the dead never truly leave us, and that the living can commune with them if the correct rites and rituals are used. While this is dismissed by orthodox scholars as nothing but fanciful superstition, after the loss of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] I am much more tempted to believe in such things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5713;It is worth investigating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5713;I am no fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5714;After weeks of dedicated study, I have finally mastered the ritual. At my command, the spirit of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] appears before me. It is just like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHe] is alive again, and we converse for hours until my power is exhausted and [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHe] has to depart once more. It is like a weight has been lifted from my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5714;Until we meet again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5715;After weeks of dedicated study, I am forced to conclude that my research has reached a dead end. None of the rituals I attempt come close to bringing me to a reunion with [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName], and perhaps no such ritual exists at all. Will I truly never see [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim] again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5715;I have learnt much about the occult, at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5716;After the death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName], I find myself drifting around, bereft of all motivation. Grief is at least something that I can understand, but this crushing emptiness is beyond grief, sapping all of my drive and desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5716;Is there truly nothing left for me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5717;While the days of mourning are a time of grief, for me, they have also proven to be a welcome respite from the struggles of everyday life. The requirement of abstinence from almost all other actions has given me time to relax and let out some of my pent-up stress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5717;A time for relaxation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5718;While the days of mourning have allowed me to relax and relief myself of some stress, it has also caused me to regard my work with less importance. After all, it feels so much better not diligently hammering away at every detail on those official papers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5718;Diligence is overrated anyways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5718;No! I must not allow myself to become lazy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5719;While I have chosen to follow a different faith from [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName], [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] blood still flows through my veins. Perhaps I should try to understand [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] faith, and thus [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim], a little better?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5719;It is part of my heritage, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5719;I must not lose sight of my own faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5720;I am a high-ranking official, and I should certainly have the resources to dedicate a large offering of food and wealth to the spirit of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName]. However, while pious, such large offerings are seen as arrogant and unbecoming of a mourning child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5720;Go ahead with the offering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5720;No, it would just be a show of pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5721;[also_mourning_relative.GetBestName], is also in mourning. Having just lost a close  relative, I can understand [also_mourning_relative.GetHerHis] pain. Perhaps I should approach [also_mourning_relative.GetHerHim] and offer my sympathies? It could be an opportunity to improve our relationship by sharing our grief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5721;I will write [also_mourning_relative.GetHerHim] a letter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5721;I won't want to bother [also_mourning_relative.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5722;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetBestName], has just written me a letter consoling me on my recent loss. This could certainly be an opportunity to strengthen our relationship, but at the same time [From.GetSheHe] is remarkably forward and [From.GetHerHis] letter could be represented as an attempt to rub salt into my wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5722;I will reciprocate [From.GetHerHis] kindness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5722;I will rebuff [From.GetHerHis] attempts at commiseration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5723;I have received a positive response from [From.GetBestName]. It seems that my sympathies were received and appreciated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5723;As a fellow mourner, [From.GetSheHe] knows my pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5724;I have received a strongly worded response from [From.GetBestName], informing me that [From.GetSheHe] has no wish to speak with me. [From.GetSheHeCap] tells me in no uncertain terms to mind my own business and leave [From.GetHerHim] to [From.GetHerHis] grief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5724;I just wanted to help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5726;In recent days, I have found myself more and more paralysed by the thought of death. The death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] has reminded me that no one is immortal, and it seems that fear of my own death has finally caught up with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5726;Anyone could be plotting to kill me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5726;I must accept this looming inevitability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5726;I will face my fears head-on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5727;In recent days, I have found myself thinking about death. The death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] has reminded me that no one has unlimited time, and I must strive to accomplish something soon before my death if I wish to be remembered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5727;I will redouble my efforts and strive for excellence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5727;My legacy will speak for itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5727;Perhaps it is time to think about curbing my ambition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5728;In recent days, I have found myself becoming more friendly towards others. The death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] has reminded me that we are all merely residing temporarily in this world, and perhaps I should be kinder to my fellow lodgers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5728;I could help others with my wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5728;I should set aside more time for those around me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5728;Kindness is a weakness within myself that I must root out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5729;In recent days, I have found myself humbled by the enormity of death. The death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] has reminded me that status in this world means nothing before mortality, and in the end our fates are subject to greater powers than our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5729;I shall devote myself to the higher powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5729;I must rule justly to be treated justly in turn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5729;Or maybe I am the highest power there is?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5730;In recent days, I have found myself doubting the benevolence of the world more and more. The death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] has reminded me of the cruelty of the world. In this unkind world, I must decide how to adapt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5730;There is truly no such thing as justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5730;I cannot be wrong if there is no right and wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5730;It does not make sense, but I must accept it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5731;In recent days, I have found myself growing even more distant from those around me. The death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] has reminded me of the pain of loss, and I do not wish to subject myself to that ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5731;I will never love again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5731;I must harden my heart and turn away from kindness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5731;I cannot isolate myself forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5732;I am not coping well with the death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName]. While I tried to hold myself together at first, I found myself growing ever more irritable, snapping at everyone around me. I just couldn't cope with all of it-;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5732;HAHAHA! WHAT A JOKE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5734;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] great virility and eagerness for sexual activity. Although some would say that such inclinations are not to be praised, Confucius does say that the filial son should not deviate from his father's ways...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5734;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5734;Lust is a sin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5735;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] voracious appetite and love of fine foods. While some scholars say that such excesses are to be condemned, [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] eating habits did keep [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim] well-fed and healthy. Perhaps I should seek to emulate [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] appetite?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SOH_5735;Gluttony is a sin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5736;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] great love for money, in particular [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] great love for hoarding money and never spending it. It certainly cannot be denied that [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHe] died a wealthy [ancestor_to_mourn.GetManWoman], and I should certainly emulate [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim] if I wish to do the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5736;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5736;Money only has value when spent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5737;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for caring little for the burdens of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] position, ignoring [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] obligations in favour of a carefree life. While diligence is certainly important, I wonder whether emulating [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] attitude would make me a happier person...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5737;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5737;My role requires my diligence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5738;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for being fast to anger and not letting anyone cross [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim] without consequences. While [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHe] certainly lacked control, no one dared to cross [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim], and perhaps I should emulate [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] behaviour to ensure that I am equally as feared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5738;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5738;I must control my more negative emotions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5739;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] strong envy towards anyone doing better than [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim]. While scholars condemn [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim] for envy, surely wishing to be better than others is a good thing that I should emulate?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5739;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5739;I must not let jealousy consume me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5740;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] pride in [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] accomplishments, often showing off and bragging to others. I myself have had many accomplishments in my life, and perhaps I should emulate [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] pride and confidence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5740;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5740;Despite my accomplishments, I should remain humble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5741;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] distaste for carnal activities.

EVTOPTB_SOH_5741;Chastity sounds boring...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5742;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] frugal tastes and moderation in food.

EVTOPTB_SOH_5742;I do not wish to starve myself for show.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5743;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] great generosity, having spent much of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] own money helping people around [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim].

EVTDESC_SOH_5744;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] diligence.

EVTOPTA_SOH_5745;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5745;Patience? Don't make me laugh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_5747;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for remaining quiet and humble throughout [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] life, never showing off [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] accomplishments. The scholars, who appear to tire of my constant bragging, have not-so-subtly hinted that perhaps I should emulate [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5747;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5747;I will stop bragging when I am in the grave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5748;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] unceasing ambition. It is said that [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHe] would stop at nothing to get ahead, and that ambition is certainly an admirable thing for me to emulate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SOH_5748;I am happy with my current status.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5749;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for having no regard for the law and making decisions as [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHe] saw fit. While the scholars speak ill of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim] for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] disregard for legal traditions, they have also been reminding me that a filial son does not deviate from his father's ways...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5749;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5749;I will be more just than my ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5750;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for never letting fear rule [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] decisions. [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHisCap] courage is certainly something of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHersHis] that would be beneficial for me to emulate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SOH_5758;Pah, justice. A child's dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_5759;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5759;To distrust everyone sounds lonely indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5760;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for avoiding contact with others as much as possible and secluding [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerselfHimself]. While it has certainly hurt [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] social relations, perhaps there is something in [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] behaviour that is worthy of my emulation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5760;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5760;And do what in seclusion? Draw funny triangles?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5761;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for never changing [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] mind, firmly sticking to [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] convictions no matter what stands in [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] way.

EVTOPTB_SOH_5761;One must be open to the ideas of others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5762;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for being trusting of other people and believing that everyone has the best of intentions. While some may call [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim] gullible, it is undeniable that [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] simple approach to others has made [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim] happier. Maybe I can emulate this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5762;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5762;I cannot allow myself to be easily tricked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5763;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for being devoted to [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] faith and ferocious in [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] defense of it. Such zeal is something that would certainly be good for me to emulate, though it may strain the religious peace around me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5763;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5763;All faiths must be respected equally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5764;The traditions of mourning dictate that I should not engage in carnal activities during the duration of mourning. While this prohibition is only loosely adhered to by most people, I could certainly go one step further and restrict myself from pleasures of the flesh for the full period of mourning, though it may not be easy for me to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5764;I will commit myself to celibacy for the full duration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5764;My pleasure is more important!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5765;A war has been declared against my realm. Although the full duration of mourning is not yet over, the defense of my people and land is more important. I cannot allow grief to hinder me, and unfortunately my mourning is at a premature end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

zhengyi_taoist;Zhengyi Dao;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zhengyi_taoist_desc;The Zhengyi Dao, the Way of Orthodox Unity, is widely held to be directly descended from the oldest branches of Taoism. It traces its lineage back to the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice (founded by Zhang Daoling) from the Han dynasty and the Way of the Celestial Masters between the Han and Tang dynasties. The Zhengyi school is the most traditional of the Taoist schools, especially in terms of their focus on talismans and alchemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
quanzhen_taoist;Quanzhen School;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
quanzhen_taoist_desc;The Quanzhen School of Complete Perfection was founded in the Jin dynasty. It places a greater focus on internal cultivation, as well as incorporating beliefs from Buddhist and Confucian texts, which were promoted by its founder, Wang Chongyang. It also demands celibacy from adepts, viewing the ultimate state of immortality as one of detachment from the mundane world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shangqing_taoist;Shangqing School;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shangqing_taoist_desc;The Shangqing School of Supreme Clarity was founded by Wei Huacun, a woman who lived in the third century. It is a highly individualistic practice, focusing on meditation and physical exercise rather than talismans and alchemy. Its influence declined during the Song dynasty and it was ultimately partially merged with the Zhengyi Dao under the Yuan dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_tianxia_6;If I wish to dedicate myself to Taoism, I should also choose one of its major schools to align myself with. Each school has a slightly different set of practices and structure, and although there is little animosity between schools selecting the correct one to guide me on my path to immortality is still important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_tianxia_6;The orthodox ways of the Zhengyi Dao are the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_tianxia_6;I find the focus on inner perfection by the Quanzhen School appealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_tianxia_6;The Shangqing School's meditation practices shall lead me to clarity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
