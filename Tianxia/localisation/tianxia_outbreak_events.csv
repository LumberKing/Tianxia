EVTDESC_TIANXIA_502;Not even the Roof of the World is safe from the Plague. Frozen corpses are piled high in the countryside, forming mounds that seem almost like a macabre counterpart to the surrounding mountains. With the Tibetan Plateau already not known for its fertility, people question if the population ever will recover fully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_504A;The Middle Kingdom is being ravaged by the Plague, and word has it that the people are questioning whether the current umperial dynasty has lost the Mandate of Heaven. Perhaps this is true, but in that case few in the area will be alive to see the birth of a new imperial dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_504B;The Middle Kingdom is being ravaged by the Plague, and some whisper that the lack of a holder of the Mandate of Heaven is to blame for this, but with the devastation left in the Plague's wake it is unknown who might be alive long enough to seize the Mandate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_506;From Naju in the south to Guseong in the north, the Korean Peninsula suffers from the dreaded Plague. None can say when the outbreak will end or who will be left alive at the end of it, but it will take years, or even decades, for the region to recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_508;Southeastern Asia suffers from the Plague. Many formerly great cities are near-abandoned as most of the surviving inhabitants have fled into the countryside. Perhaps they will be reclaimed one day, or perhaps the jungles will swallow them forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_510;Japan, thought by many to be easy to keep safe from the Plague, has proven to be as susceptible to the disease as any other region. Corpses litter the abandoned rice fields, and several cities are almost entirely depopulated. Amaterasu-Omikami must be weeping for her descendants' homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_512;The islands of southeastern Asia were initially safe from the Plague, but the quarantines that were put in place were not as effective as people had hoped. The predators in the jungles makes fleeing into the countryside a risky prospect, but many of the surviving inhabitants are supposedly risking it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
