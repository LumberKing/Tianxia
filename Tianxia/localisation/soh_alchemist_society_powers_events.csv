EVTDESC_SOH_10902;[Root.GetBestName],\nI find myself in need of a Court Alchemist, and I think you would do very well in that regard. I hope you will not turn down this opportunity.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10902;This is a great opportunity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10903;There are several options as to where I might acquire the ingredients I seek. I need to pick one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10903;I will look for useful herbs in the wild!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10903;I will look for dangerous herbs in the wild!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_10903;I will visit the market!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_10903;I will visit the black market!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_10903;I will hunt for animal parts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_10903;I will ask my fellow alchemists for useful ingredients!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_SOH_10903;I will ask my fellow alchemists for dangerous ingredients!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTH_SOH_10903;Actually, I think I will do this later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10904;I have arrived at what should be a good spot to gather some useful herbs. It is time for me to get to work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10904;I just need to avoid the poisonous ones!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10905_A;I found a large number of useful herbs in the wild. I can already think of several uses for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10905_B;I found a few useful herbs in the wild. I should put them to good use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10905_C;I did not find many useful herbs in the wild, and some of those I found might have been harmful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10905;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10905;An acceptable outcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_10905;That did not go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10906;I have arrived at what should be a good spot to gather some dangerous herbs. It is time for me to get to work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10906;I just need to avoid poisoning myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10907_A;I found a large number of dangerous herbs in the wild. I can already think of several uses for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10907_B;I found a few dangerous herbs in the wild. I should put them to good use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10907_C;I did not find many dangerous herbs in the wild, and did not handle the ones I found very carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10907;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10907;An acceptable outcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_10907;That did not go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10908;I have arrived at the market, and will now need to find a merchant that has what I need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10908;Hopefully that will not be too hard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10909_A;I found several merchants that had useful ingredients for sale at a reasonable price. I can already think of several uses for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10909_B;I found a merchant that had useful ingredients for sale. I should put them to good use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10909_C;I had a hard time tracking down a merchant that had what I needed, and had to pay rather much to get anything at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10909;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10909;An acceptable outcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_10909;That did not go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10910;I have made my way to the black market, and will now need to find a merchant that is the right kind of disreputable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10910;Hopefully that will not be too hard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10911_A;I found several merchants that had useful ingredients for sale at a reasonable price. I can already think of several uses for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10911_B;I found a merchant that had useful ingredients for sale. I should put them to good use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10911_C;I had a hard time tracking down a merchant that had what I needed, and had to pay rather much to get anything at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10911;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10911;An acceptable outcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_10911;That did not go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10912;I have reached a good hunting spot, and now I need to catch some wild beasts. My skills are hopefully up to the task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10912;Time to hunt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10913_A;I had little trouble catching several small beasts and easily harvested some ingredients from them. I can already think of several uses for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10913_B;I managed to catch some small beasts after a while, and now have some new ingredients. I should put them to good use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10913_C;I almost did not catch anything, and did not get many ingredients from the hunting trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10913;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10913;An acceptable outcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_10913;That did not go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10914;I have managed to figure out several less famous alchemists that might have ingredients to spare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10914;Surely they will share!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10915_A;The alchemists I spoke with were quite willing to share their ingredients in exchange for me putting in a few good words. I can already think of several uses for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10915_B;The alchemists I spoke with agreed to share a few ingredients, though I had to put in a lot of good words on their behalf. I should put them to good use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10915_C;It was hard for me to convince the alchemists I spoke with to share any of their ingredients, even after putting in some good words on their behalf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10915;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10915;An acceptable outcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_10915;That did not go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10916;I have managed to figure out several less famous alchemists that might have ingredients to spare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10916;Surely they will share!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10917_A;The alchemists I spoke with were quite willing to share their ingredients in exchange for me putting in a few good words. I can already think of several uses for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10917_B;The alchemists I spoke with agreed to share a few ingredients, though I had to put in a lot of good words on their behalf. I should put them to good use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10917_C;It was hard for me to convince the alchemists I spoke with to share any of their ingredients, even after putting in some good words on their behalf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10917;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10917;An acceptable outcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_10917;That did not go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10919;A truly useful alchemical laboratory can take both time and money to assemble, but without one I will surely have a hard time learning how to brew useful potions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10919;I must build one in the name of science!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10919;I am not sure now is the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10920;There are many different aspects that might be worth considering when constructing an alchemical laboratory. Perhaps I should strive for secrecy, or focus on usefulness, or make sure to build it in a sacred place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10920;My secrets will be safe deep within the walls of [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10920;I will build an efficient and accessible laboratory for research!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_10920;A sacred location will help unlock mystical secrets!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10921;Now that I have selected the location for my alchemical laboratory I need to make a decision as to its extent and the overall quality of its contents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10921;A modest setup will serve me well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10921;I want something that's neither too large nor too small!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_10921;Only a state of the art laboratory will do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_10921;I will create the greatest alchemical laboratory ever seen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10922;It is said that jade is invested with healing powers that can be transferred into substances prepared in vessels made from it. Perhaps I should invest in such containers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10922;I think more modest vessels will do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10922;Jade vessels are mandatory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10923;I have heard of certain books written by the alchemists of the past that might contain valuable insights. Perhaps I should acquire a few of them and add them to the library of my laboratory...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10923;I don't think I need them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10923;I will get a few books!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10924;There are certain tools that only can be found in distant lands that might be useful during my laboratory experiments. Perhaps I should dispatch some agents to acquire them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10924;I can make do without them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10924;I need those tools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10925;I have heard that some alchemists see fit to add holy wards to their laboratories to ward off evil spirits and the interference of sorcerers seeking to disrupt their experiments. Perhaps I should invest in such protection...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10925;I doubt they would help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10925;I want such wards for my laboratory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10926;Some of those working on the constrution of my laboratory have expressed the opinion that it looks rather plain, even though I know that some of the things in it would impress any alchemist worthy of the name. Perhaps some impressive-looking decorations are necessary...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10926;I don't care to impress everyone...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10926;It wouldn't hurt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10927;Today I discovered that [discovered_lab.GetBestName] had followed some of the laborers working on my secret alchemical laboratory inside and that [discovered_lab.GetSheHe] had figured out what they were building. I doubt [discovered_lab.GetSheHe] will keep quiet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10927;I suppose it doesn't need to be secret...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10927;[discovered_lab.GetSheHeCap] knows too much!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10928;Disaster! One of the walls collapsed due to the laborers not being as careful as they should have been, and now my secret alchemical laboratory is anything but secret!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10928;I guess I won't have a secret lab after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10929;While my secret alchemical laboratory is hidden from the world at large, the entrance to it might be a point of weakness. Perhaps I should make sure to conceal it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10929;An unmarked and locked door will do just fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10929;I want a sliding bookcase or something!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10930;As the work on my secret alchemical laboratory continues I find some of the constraints put on it fairly limiting. Perhaps it should be larger, even if it means that it will be less hidden...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10930;Secrecy is of utmost importance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10930;Maybe secrecy isn't the only thing that matters...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10931;I have been informed that while my alchemical laboratory is in a location of great spiritual significance its Feng Shui is rather lacking. This might be detrimental when it comes to making full use of the spiritual energy associated with its location...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10931;It matters not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10931;Find someone to advise me on the matter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10932;Several rather important holy men and women have heard of my alchemical laboratory and have seen fit to visit the site where it is being constructed. They have only had good things to say about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10932;That's good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10933;Some of the peasants in [Root.Capital.GetName] are concerned by the alchemical laboratory that I am constructing. It seems they think it might be used for nefarious purposes and that it will do more harm than good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10933;I will attempt to assuage their fears...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10933;Shut up, peasant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10934;Some of the laborers managed to misplace a few of my ingredients when moving them to my new alchemical laboratory, and they have not been found despite an exhaustive search.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10934;That's unfortunate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10935;Today some of the laborers working on my new alchemical laboratory dropped a crate containing some rather fragile pieces of equipment, and they are beyond repair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10935;They will need to be replaced...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10937;It is certainly not impressive to look at, and some of the equipment inside is not of very high quality, but my alchemical laboratory is finally ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10937;It will have to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10938;My new alchemical laboratory is finally ready. I have seen some that are more impressive, and some that are rather less so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10938;I think it will do nicely...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10939;Today the work on my alchemical laboratory was completed. It is quite a bit more impressive than most I have seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10939;This will work quite well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_10940;The Ambition of a [Root.GetTitle];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10940;;After months of hard work and a considerable amount of money spent, my new alchemical laboratory is the envy of anyone who wishes to learn all that can be learned within the field. This laboratory will allow me to perform any experiment that has so far been documented and is a testament to my great ambitions in the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10940;Money well spent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_10941;The Grand Laboratory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10941;With no expenses spared and under my constant supervision an alchemical laboratory unmatched by any previously constructed has been erected to realize the dream of a perfect alchemical working environment. Many of the contraptions have been conceived and drawn by me personally, and the knowledge needed to replicate them might be priceless.\n\nThe laboratory now stands ready to allow me to uncover how any ingredient conceivable can be used in alchemical potions, whether to heal or to harm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10941;I will achieve great things here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10942;I am considering a short excursion to sell some potions to the common people. This might both help me earn money and help me gain some further valuable insights into some of the ingredients in my possession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10942;It'll be a good use of my skills!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10942;Maybe later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10943;I need to decide where I will be selling my potions. Selling them closer to home might be safer in some ways, but I could perhaps also head elsewhere if I want to try my luck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10943;[sell_potions_province_1.GetName] is the right choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10943;I will head to [sell_potions_province_1.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_10943;Actually, [sell_potions_province_1.GetName] might be best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10944;There are several options as to what I might try to sell to the people of [sell_potions_province.GetName]. My fellow alchemists would probably expect me to try for healing potions, or maybe aphrodisiacs, but perhaps that is not what I want to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10944;I will only sell beneficial potions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10944;I think some harmless placebos would do the most good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_10944;I intend to earn money, no matter what it takes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_10944;The locals will rue this day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10945;I have set up a small market stand in one of the markets in [sell_potions_province.GetName], and have started preparing my potions. Now I only need to hope that the locals actually purchase something, and that it works the way I hope it will...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10945;I've got what you need!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10947;The locals are quite eager to buy my potions, and as far as I can tell they are satisfied with the results. I doubt they will have a major impact on the health of the population, but I made good money and they appreciated my presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10947;A good outcome, I think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10948;It seems the locals in [sell_potions_province.GetName] are suffering from a variety of ailments. Most of them are familiar to me, and I have little trouble figuring out just what kind of potions to sell them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10948;That worked out quite well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10949;While alchemical potions can help with a number of ailments, there are limits even for a skilled alchemist. Unfortunately for me, some of the locals seem to be in the market for potions that would grow back missing limbs, that would restore their body to its prime, or that would do a number of other impossible things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10949;I am sorry, but I can't help with that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10950;The locals in [sell_potions_province.GetName] seem to be suffering from a variety of ailments, and I do my best to help them with my potions. Unfortunately, while a few get better it seems most are beyond the ability of my potions to help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10950;Unfortunate, that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10951;I sell a number of potions to help the locals of [sell_potions_province.GetName] with their varied ailments, but in the end it seems my potions do more harm than good even when consumed exactly as specified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10951;Perhaps the dosage was wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10952;To my delight, many of the people in [sell_potions_province.GetName] apparently are in the market for aphrodisiacs. I do not really know if they simply wish to make a distracted spouse pay more attention to them or if they seek to entice someone that normally would refuse to spend time with them, but it matters little.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10952;This has gone well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10953;As I am having a meal after long day of selling aphrodisiacs a young [aphrodisiac_buyer.GetManWoman] makes [aphrodisiac_buyer.GetHerHis] way over to me and strikes up a conversation. I vaguely recognize [aphrodisiac_buyer.GetHerHim] as one of my customers, but something seems different now, and [aphrodisiac_buyer.GetSheHe] suggests maybe we should retire somewhere more private.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10953;What a wonderful idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10953;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10954;It seems the aphrodisiacs I have been selling to the people of [sell_potions_province.GetName] have been very effective. Unfortunately, it seems some of the locals are less than pleased over this development, seeing as there has been an increase of cheating spouses and unchaste sons and daughters since my arrival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10954;It's not my fault your [Root.GetHusbandWifeOpp] is unfaithful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10954;I should take my leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10955;Some of the locals in [sell_potions_province.GetName] seem rather upset with me. Apparently the aphrodisiacs they bought were not as effective as they expected them to be. The fact that the complainers all appear to be ugly, rude, or both is unlikely to be a coincidence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10955;Terms and conditions apply, as per the disclaimer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10955;I should take my leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10956;As I was packing up my stand after a profitable day in [sell_potions_province.GetName] a [Root.GetManWoman] approached me and asked to speak to me in private. It seems [Root.GetSheHe] is a local healer and that [Root.GetSheHe] approves of what I have been doing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10956;Thank you for your kind words!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10957;The potions I have been selling to the locals in [sell_potions_province.GetName] have not been able to cure all of the locals' ailments, but some of them have been effective, and I have made a decent profit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10957;I suppose that's a decent outcome...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10958;Despite me focusing on selling placebos it seems the overall health of the locals in [sell_potions_province.GetName] has increased following my arrival, in many cases following a purchase from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10958;Better than I expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10959;The harmless placebos I have been selling have, unsurprisingly, not been terribly effective. The locals mostly seem satisfied, but a few of them have been heard grumbling about their purchases not living up to expectations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10959;The potion... needs more time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10960;It seems some of the potions I have been selling have been doing more harm than good. I thought I was selling harmless placebos, but whether due to me messing up the dosage or the locals not following my instructions they certainly do not seem harmless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10960;How unexpected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10960;I should take my leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10961;The locals in [sell_potions_province.GetName] have been most eager to buy potions from me, and I have had little trouble creating something seemingly interesting from a handful of actual alchemical ingredients diluted with a large quantity of water and coloured by a pinch of petals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10961;I should sell a few more and then leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10962;There has not been as much interest in the potions I have prepared as I had expected, but a few of the locals have bought some, and so far they do not seem dissatisfied. Still, I should not overstay my welcome...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10962;I guess that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10963;It seems the potions I have prepared have not lived up to the locals' expectations, which probably is unsurprising when they are not exactly proper potions. So far, there is just grumbling, but I might need to leave before they realize that I might not have been completely honest about what I have been selling...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10963;Maybe you need another one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10963;I should take my leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10964;Today a local healer approached me while I was selling my potions in [sell_potions_province.GetName]. The [Root.GetManWoman] asked me some questions about the potions, and was apparently not pleased with the answers, seeing as [Root.GetSheHe] loudly proclaimed that I was up to something before [Root.GetSheHe] left.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10964;I assure you this is a legitimate operation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10964;I should take my leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10965;It seems my potions have been ineffective. The locals in [sell_potions_province.GetName] have not become ill due to them, at least not for the most part, but they do not seem entirely happy with my continued presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10965;At least I am making some money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10965;I should take my leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10966;As the days pass more and more of the locals arrive to buy potions from me. Curious about this, I inquire about the matter, and it turns out that nearly everyone knows someone that got better thanks to one of my potions. That was very much not what I inteded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10966;I must have gotten the dosage wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10967;I make fairly good money selling my potions in [sell_potions_province.GetName], but other than that things do not seem to be going the way I expected them to go. The locals have not gotten much healthier, but they certainly have not started to become unwell either.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10967;I expected... something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10968;As the days go by I start hearing rumours that the people of [sell_potions_province.GetName] are falling ill with a number of unknown ailments. They do not seem to have caught on that most of those that have fallen ill have done so after buying something from me, as the line in front of my stall keeps growing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10968;Fools! I will destroy you all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10969;The locals in [sell_potions_province.GetName] seem to be falling ill with a number of ailments. Unfortunately, if the rumours I have been hearing are true, some of them seem to suspect that my potions are behind it. I might be overstaying my welcome here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10969;I will sell a few more, then leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10969;I should take my leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10970;Today a local healer came to the market while I was selling my potions. [Root.GetSheHeCap] pushed [Root.GetHerHis] way through the crowd, coming face to face with me, and then angrily proclaimed that I was trying to poison the locals. [Root.GetSheHeCap] promised to return with proof before long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10970;You can't prove anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10970;I should take my leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10971;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] is selling potions in [sell_potions_province.GetName]. It is certainly true that an alchemist's potions might be very helpful, should the alchemist be both skilled and honest, but an unskilled alchemist or one that seeks to do harm might be a danger to the populace...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10971;I trust [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10971;I will have my guards take a quick look...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_10971;Guards! Search the whole market stall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10972;Some of [From.GetBestName]'s guards arrived at the market as I was selling my potions and asked a few questions. They seemed satisfied with the answers I gave them, and the locals did not mind, which probably is a good thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10972;Back to business...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10972;That could have ended poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10973;My guards have returned with word that [From.GetBestName]'s business seems quite legitimate, and that the locals certainly do not seem to be concerned by [From.GetHerHis] presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10973;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10974;Some of [From.GetBestName]'s guards showed up as I was selling potions and demanded answers to a number of questions about my potions. My answers seemed to satisfy them, but the locals seem to have been scared off...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10974;And things were going so well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10974;Not good, but I suppose it could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10975;My guards have returned, informing me that while [From.GetBestName]'s business semms legitimate the locals seem to have reconsidered buying any potions following their arrival at the marketplace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10975;Perhaps for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10976;Some of [From.GetBestName]'s guards arrived in the marketplace and demanded that I let them search my market stall. They spent quite some time at it, but eventually they seemed satisfied that there was nothing suspicious to be found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10976;Back to business...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10976;That could have ended poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10977;My guards have returned with word that there is nothing suspicious to be found in [From.GetBestName]'s market stall. They claim that their search was most thorough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10977;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10978;Some of [From.GetBestName]'s guards arrived in the marketplace and demanded that I let them search my market stall. It did not take long before one of them held up one of my potions, claiming it looked suspicious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10978;I assure you that's harmless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10978;That's not... actually, it's harmless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10979;My guards have returned, bringing with them one of [From.GetBestName]'s potions. They claim that something is not right with it, especially as [From.GetBestName] was quick to argue that it was completely harmless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10979;I will give [From.GetHerHim] the benefit of the doubt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10979;Arrest [From.GetHerHim] at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10980;Some of [From.GetBestName]'s guards arrived in the marketplace and demanded that I let them search my market stall. Despite me having anticipated such a thing happening and having taken steps to hide certain things, the guards still found more than enough evidence that I might be up to no good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10980;I don't know how that got there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10981;My guards have returned, bringing with them several items. The labels seem somewhat suspect, and apparently [From.GetBestName] was protesting that someone else must have put them in [From.GetHerHis] market stall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10981;It might be nothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10981;Arrest [From.GetHerHim] at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10982;The guards have returned, with the crowds dispersing ahead of them. It is not at all surprising when their commander demands that I surrender myself into their custody.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10982;I will come quietly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10982;How about some gold...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_10982;You'll never catch me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10983;My guards have returned, bringing with them [From.GetBestName]. I have [From.GetHerHim] escorted to the dungeons for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10983;I wonder what punishment fits the crime...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10984;My guards have returned, but they are not bringing [From.GetBestName] with them. They are unspecific as to how [From.GetSheHe] managed to escape from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10984;I wonder what went wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10985;The guards give chase quickly enough, but they were evidently not expecting me to make a run for it. I manage to leave them all behind before long, and then more stealthily continue on my way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10985;I should head back home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10986;I leave the guards behind at first, but just as I start to feel that I will be able to make my escape I make a wrong turn and find myself in a dead end. As I start backtracking I soon find myself surrounded by the guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10986;I surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10987;I have just been informed that [From.GetBestName] managed to evade my guards. Without doubt, [From.GetSheHe] has left the area by now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10987;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10988;I have just been informed that despite an attempt to make a run for it [From.GetBestName] has been captured by my guards and has been brought to the dungeons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10988;Good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10989;I half expect [From.GetBestName]'s guards to return seeking to arrest me, but they never arrive. Still, the locals are avoiding me, and it might only be a matter of time before something more goes wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10989;I should not stay here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10990;It seems a number of the locals in [sell_potions_province.GetName] have decided that they really do not like my presence. The various torches and farming implements they are carrying makes it clear their intentions are not peaceful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10990;Time to run...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_10990;Time to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10991;I run away from the mob, expecting them to give chase within moments. To my surprise, none of them seem to follow. Judging by the smoke rising up from behind the houses, it seems they were content with simply burning down my market stall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10991;Works for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10992;I make a run for it, and a few members of the mob give chase. They do not manage to catch up to me, but a few of them throw rocks my way, and a few of them manage to injure me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10992;'Tis just a scratch...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10993;The mob is taken by surprise when I move to attack it, and surprise soon becomes fear. Most are running before my first blow lands, and before long only the dead and dying remain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10993;I should still leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10994;The mob is taken by surprise when I move to attack it, and surprise soon becomes fear. A few put up a fight, but most make a run for it, and in the end I am barely injured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10994;'Tis just a scratch...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10995;The mob is taken by surprise when I move to attack it, but that does not last. They fight back viciously, and I am badly injured by the time the remaining members of the mob decide to leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10995;At leat I live...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10996;The mob is taken by surprise when I move to attack it, but that does not last, and as badly outnumbered as I am even farming implements can be deadly, as I soon find out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10996;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10997;I have returned home after selling my potions. Things went quite well, as far as I am concerned, and I should probably consider doing it again in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10997;Time well spent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10998;While things could have gone better when I was selling potions things also could have gone a lot worse. Maybe I should do it again in the future...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10998;That might have been worth it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_10999;I have returned home, and it was probably a mistake for me to leave in the first place. If I ever decide to sell potions again, I hope it goes differently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10999;That went... poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11001;A laboratory experiment is a good way to gain valuable insights into the properties of alchemical ingredients, and generally a bit less risky than experimenting on myself. It will require my attention for some time, however...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11001;For science!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11001;I should do this later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11002;Before my laboratory experiment can begin I need to decide which ingredient or ingredients to experiment with. All might have useful qualities, of course, but I need to focus on one or two for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11002;I wonder what I can do with some [GetSelectedIngredient_1]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11002;[GetSelectedIngredient_2] still holds many secrets...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11002;I should use them both!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11003;I am ready to begin my laboratory experiment. The only thing left to decide on is my approach. A riskier approach might result in greater discoveries, but safety might also be advantageous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11003;Safety is paramount!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11003;I must be thorough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11003;A few risks might be necessary...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_11003;I will show them ALL!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11005;My laboratory experiment has concluded, and I have obtained a number of insights into how I will be able to create various beneficial potions in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11005;I'm making a note here: Huge success!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11006;My laboratory experiment has concluded. While I have not gained any insights into how to brew better healing potions, I have obtained a number of insights into poisons instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11006;I'm making a note here: Huge success!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11007;My laboratory experiment has concluded. The insights I have obtained have been mixed, and I am not sure if they will be of the most use when it comes to healing or when it comes to inflicting harm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11007;I'm making a note here: Huge success!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11008;I have concluded my laboratory experiment, and I have obtained a few insights into how to create better potions in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11008;An acceptable outcome...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11009;I have concluded my laboratory experiment, and I have obtained a few insights into how to create better poisons in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11009;An acceptable outcome...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11010;I have concluded my laboratory experiment, and I have obtained a few insights that I am unsure whether I will find useful in a manner that is helpful or a manner that is harmful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11010;An acceptable outcome...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11011;My laboratory experiment was a failure. I have barely obtained any useful insights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11011;Useless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11012;My laboratory experiment was a failure. I have barely obtained any useful insights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11012;Useless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11013;My laboratory experiment was a failure. I have barely obtained any useful insights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11013;Useless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11014;The most exciting development during my laboratory experiment was the destruction of several glass vials as I was distracted while attempting to retreive them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11014;I will need to replace those...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11015;I was a bit distracted while moving about my laboratory today, and as a result I lost some valuable ingredients. My attempt to salvage them also distracted me from my ongoing experiment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11015;That's hardly ideal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11016;Right as I was about to write down the new discoveries I had made during my laboratory experiment the kettle I was brewing the potion in boiled over, and the liquid inside caused significant damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11016;My notes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11017;As I was attempting to lift the kettle in my laboratory today I lost my grip and dropped it. I managed to avoid most of the liquid inside, but not all of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11017;That hurt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11018;Today things went horribly wrong in my laboratory. Things started well, but I was startled by a sudden noise and lost my footing, pulling down a table and several tools on top of me. By the time my servants got me out, the damage was already done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11018;This is not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11019;The kettle is boiling over, and the flames under it are spreading. The smoke is strangely colourful, and I am having trouble breathing. Maybe I can escape? The door is... The door is blocked!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11019;NOOOOOO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11020;I have had no luck during my laboratory experiment. It seems everything I have achieved is just repeating old experiments, whether my own or those of others. Surely a breakthrough is just around the corner!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11020;I must be missing something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11021;Failure. Today's experiment did not go well, nor the one yesterday, nor the one last week. The only thing I have achieved is wasting valuable ingredients and valuable time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11021;I am a failure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11022;I might have been a bit careless today as I was pouring myself some tea while taking a break from my laboratory experiment, and some of the ingredients I was experimenting with ended up in the tea. However, this was a good thing, as it seems my fever has broken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11022;That's a successful experiment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11023;I was a bit careless while having my tea today, and some small amounts of the ingredients I had been working with got into it. Now I am feeling rather less able to focus, as the tea did not give me as much energy as usual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11023;So... tired...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11024;My laboratory experiment has involved boiling or burning various ingredients, which has resulted in some rather strange fumes in my laboratory. They make it a bit hard to focus, but I certainly do not feel unwell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11024;They make me feel funny;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11025;I do not know if it the fumes in my laboratory or trace amounts of some ingredients ending up in my food or drink, but I am experiencing some nausea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11025;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11026;I was a bit careless with some of the Hibiscus I was experimenting with and dropped it in my tea. Not wanting to send for more tea, I decided to drink it anyway. I cannot tell for sure if there is a connection, but I feel rather less stressed now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11026;I feel like a new person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_11027;This morning, I was starting to suspect that I was pregnant with [father_of_child.GetBestName]'s child, and I might well have been, but as of right now I can say for sure that I am not pregnant. Possibly, the Hibiscus I have been experimenting with is to blame, as I might not have been careful enough when handling it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_11027;It seems my pregnancy with [father_of_child.GetBestName]'s child has come to an unexpected, premature end. Possibly, the Hibiscus I have been experimenting with is to blame, as I might not have been careful enough when handling it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11027;I can't be sure, but I might have been...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11027;My baby...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11027;Perhaps for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11028;I have been careless during my recent experiments with Ginger Root, and now I find myself having some very concerning bowel movements. I have needed to repeatedly excuse myself from several recent meetings, sometimes barely in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11028;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11029;It seems the Mandrake I have been experimenting with has some side effects, and that I have not been handling it as carefully as I should have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11029;Can't... breathe...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11030;I have likely not been as careful as I should have been when it comes to the Mandrake I have been experimenting with. I am having trouble keeping my meals down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11030;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11031;I have been careless during my recent experiments with Mandrake, and now I find myself having some very concerning bowel movements. I have needed to repeatedly excuse myself from several recent meetings, sometimes barely in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11031;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11032;I might have mishandled the Mandrake I have been experimenting with, seeing as I have been experiencing some strange hallucinations lately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11032;What's real?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11033;My vision has been rather blurry lately. I suspect that the Mandrake I have been experimenting with has something to do with it, as I have perhaps not been as careful with it as I should have been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11033;I can barely see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11034;I was a bit careless with some of the Lemon Grass I was experimenting with and dropped it in my tea. Not wanting to send for more tea, I decided to drink it anyway. I cannot tell for sure if there is a connection, but I feel rather less stressed now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11034;I feel like a new person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11035;It seems the infected wound I have been suffering from has gotten better. Some trace residues of the Lemon Grass I have been experimenting with might have been on my hand when I touched it the other day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11035;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11036;Somewhat embarrassingly, I seem to have developed a rash on my skin lately. I strongly suspect that the Nettles I have been experimenting with are to blame, as I have handled them a bit carelessly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11036;I should have known better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11037;I have been having a hangover for some time, which has been quite distracting, but today it unexpectedly vanished. The Wormwood I have been experimenting with might be behind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11037;I feel amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11038;Yesterday some of the Wormwood I was experimenting with got into my tea. Not wanting to send for more tea, I decided to drink it, and it might have been beneficial, seeing as I slept better last night than I have for many months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11038;I feel like a new person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11039;I have gotten a major headache, and it does not seem to be going away. It is possible that it is due to me mishandling the Valerian I have been experimenting with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11039;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11040;I have been careless during my recent experiments with Valerian, and now I find myself having some very concerning bowel movements. I have needed to repeatedly excuse myself from several recent meetings, sometimes barely in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11040;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11041;I seem to have developed a rash on my skin lately. I strongly suspect that the Yarrow I have been experimenting with is to blame, as I have handled it a bit carelessly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11041;This is not ideal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11042;I have likely not been as careful as I should have been when it comes to the Yarrow I have been experimenting with. I am having trouble keeping my meals down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11042;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11043;I have been careless during my recent experiments with Yarrow, and now I find myself having some very concerning bowel movements. I have needed to repeatedly excuse myself from several recent meetings, sometimes barely in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11043;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11044;Somewhat embarrassingly, I seem to have developed a rash on my skin lately. I strongly suspect that the Ivy I have been experimenting with is to blame, as I have handled it a bit carelessly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11044;I should have known better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11045;I might have mishandled the Foxglove I have been experimenting with, seeing as I have been experiencing some strange hallucinations lately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11045;What's real?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11046;My vision has been rather blurry lately. I suspect that the Foxglove I have been experimenting with has something to do with it, as I have perhaps not been as careful with it as I should have been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11046;I can barely see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11047;As I perform my experiments on the Eyeballs I cannot quite shake the feeling that the ones that I have not gotten around to experimenting on are watching me, even though that surely cannot be the case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11047;I must be imagining things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11048;The Eyeballs in my laboratory are watching me, judging my every move as I experiment on them. They know things. They know things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11048;I must hide from them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11048;I must destroy them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11049;The Heart I have been experimenting with almost seemed to beat today, even though that clearly is impossible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11049;I must be imagining things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11050;At first I thought my mind was playing games with me, but now I am certain that the Heart I have been experimenting on is beating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11050;It's ALIVE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11051;As I exited my laboratory after adding yet more silver dust to the potion I was brewing one of the servants let out a yelp upon spotting me. The [Root.GetManWoman] apologized, but suggested that I might want to have a look in a mirror. What I saw was quite unexpected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11051;I'm... blue?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11052;It seems the Silver I was experimenting with has come into contact with some [target_artifact.GetIngredientType] in some fashion, which has resulted in it being tarnished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11052;What a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11053;I am feeling physically weaker than before. I am not certain, but it is possible that it is due to me handling the Mercury I have been experimenting with carelessly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11053;I feel so weak...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11054;I have gotten a major headache, and it does not seem to be going away. It is possible that it is due to me mishandling the Mercury I have been experimenting with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11054;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11055;I seem to have developed a rash recently. I suspect that it might be due to me not handing the Mercury I have been experimenting with as carefully as I should have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11055;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11056;My recent experiments with Mercury do not seem to have yielded many useful results. At least that is what I remember, but my memory has been rather spotty lately...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11056;What's going on...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11057;Every time I exit my laboratory after my experiments with Mercury I can feel the eyes of my courtiers on me, watching my every move. I am certain that I am not just imagining things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11057;They're after my secrets!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11058;My vision has been rather blurry lately. I suspect that the Mercury I have been experimenting with has something to do with it, as I have perhaps not been as careful with it as I should have been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11058;I can barely see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11059;Something strange has been going on after I started my recent experiments with Mercury. I seem incapable of forming the right sentences while speaking, and I cannot explain why...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11059;Not right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_11060;Though not everything I have read on the subject agrees, there are some alchemists that claim that some ingredients, such as Mercury and Cinnabar, can cause problems for the unborn children of women that come into contact with it.

EVTDESCB_SOH_11060;Though not everything I have read on the subject agrees, there are some alchemists that claim that some ingredients, such as Mercury and Cinnabar, can cause problems for the unborn children of women that come into contact with it. I did not remember this when I began my laboratory experiment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11060;This might be a problem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11060;I should have been more careful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11063;I have been feeling unwell lately. It seems to have started after I began my recent laboratory experiments with Mercury, but the correlation might be a coincidence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11063;What's happening to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11064;Not everyone respects alchemists such as me! Fools, all of them! They think us mad! They think they know better! They claim Mercury is dangerous! They are wrong! I will show them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11064;I will show them ALL!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11065;I was a bit careless when moving some ingredients around in my laboratory, and accidentally dropped some Gold in the Aqua Regia I was experimenting with. It was dissolved before I could take it out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11065;What a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11066;Some of the Silver in my laboratory accidentally came into contact with the Aqua Regia I was experimenting with, and it ended up tarnished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11066;What a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11067;Some of the Silver in my laboratory accidentally came into contact with the Aqua Fortis I was experimenting with, and it ended up tarnished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11067;What a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11068;I barely have time to register that something is wrong before the Aqua Fortis I was experimenting with exploded, sending shards of broken glass flying across my laboratory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11068;Take cover!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11069;Some of the Silver in my laboratory accidentally came into contact with the Brimstone I was experimenting with, and it ended up tarnished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11069;What a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11070;As my experiments with Brimstone continue I have started to notice something that smells rather bad in my laboratory. Today I realized that the smell followed me as I left my laboratory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11070;Is it me...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11071;I seem to have developed a rash on my skin lately. I strongly suspect that the Brimstone I have been experimenting with is to blame, as I have handled it a bit carelessly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11071;This isn't great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11072;I have been careless during my recent experiments with Brimstone, and now I find myself having some very concerning bowel movements. I have needed to repeatedly excuse myself from several recent meetings, sometimes barely in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11072;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11073;As I was carrying out my most recent experiments with Brimstone I felt something get in one of my eyes and decided to scratch it. Whatever initially was in my eye quickly became the least of my worries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11073;My eye!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11074;Today the potion I was brewing in my kettle unexpectedly exploded, sending the Brimstone-rich liquid inside flying in all directions. I got some on my skin, and the result was anything but pretty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11074;My face!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11075;I dropped a bottle of Aqua Regia today as I was moving it, and the liquid splashed all over the Gold I was experimenting with. It quickly dissolved, resulting in the loss of two valuable ingredients.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11075;What a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11076;I have likely not been as careful as I should have been when it comes to the Copper I have been experimenting with. I am having trouble keeping my meals down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11076;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11077;I have likely not been as careful as I should have been when it comes to the Tin I have been experimenting with. I am having trouble keeping my meals down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_11079;I have been feeling a pain in my stomach recently, and it has only been getting worse. I suspect that the Lead I have been experimenting with might be to blame, as I might have been a bit careless when handling it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11079;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_11080;This morning, I was starting to suspect that I was pregnant with [father_of_child.GetBestName]'s child, and I might well have been, but as of right now I can say for sure that I am not pregnant. Possibly, the Lead I have been experimenting with is to blame, as I might not have been careful enough when handling it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_11080;It seems my pregnancy with [father_of_child.GetBestName]'s child has come to an unexpected, premature end. Possibly, the Lead I have been experimenting with is to blame, as I might not have been careful enough when handling it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_SOH_11080;Perhaps for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11081;My recent experiments with Lead do not seem to have yielded many useful results. At least that is what I remember, but my memory has been rather spotty lately...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11081;What's going on...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11082;I might have mishandled the Lead I have been experimenting with, seeing as I have been experiencing some strange hallucinations lately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11082;What's real?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11083;Following my recent laboratory experiments with Lead I have noticed that I long for physical contact rather less than I have in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11083;One less thing to distract me from my experiments, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11084;I do not know if it the fumes in my laboratory or trace amounts of Lead ending up in my food or drink, but I am experiencing some nausea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11084;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11085;Ever since I started my laboratory experiments with Lead I have been sleeping poorly. It might be a coincidence, but there might also be a correlation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11085;So... tired...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11086;I am feeling physically weaker than before. I am not certain, but it is possible that it is due to me handling the Mercury I have been experimenting with carelessly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11086;I feel so weak...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11087;I have been careless during my recent experiments with Lead, and now I find myself having some very concerning bowel movements. I have needed to repeatedly excuse myself from several recent meetings, sometimes barely in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11087;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11088;I have lost quite a bit of weight since I started my recent experiments with Lead. Perhaps there is no correlation, but it might not just be a coincidence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11088;This might be bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11089;I have gotten a major headache, and it does not seem to be going away. It is possible that it is due to me mishandling the Antimony I have been experimenting with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11089;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11090;The longer I keep experimenting with the Antimony, the more certain I am feeling that it is a waste of my time. I might be throwing my life away chasing an impossible dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11090;It's all pointless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11091;I have been feeling a bit dizzy lately. I suspect it might be due to me being a bit careless with the Antimony I have been experimenting with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11091;Steady now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_11123;What's going on...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11124;Every time I exit my laboratory after my experiments with Cinnabar I can feel the eyes of my courtiers on me, watching my every move. I am certain that I am not just imagining things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11124;They're after my secrets!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11125;My vision has been rather blurry lately. I suspect that the Cinnabar I have been experimenting with has something to do with it, as I have perhaps not been as careful with it as I should have been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11125;I can barely see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11126;Something strange has been going on after I started my recent experiments with Cinnabar. I seem incapable of forming the right sentences while speaking, and I cannot explain why...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11126;Not right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11127;I have been feeling unwell lately. It seems to have started after I began my recent laboratory experiments with Cinnabar, but the correlation might be a coincidence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_11129;Some of the Silver in my laboratory accidentally came into contact with the Realgar I was experimenting with, and it ended up tarnished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_11132;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11133;I seem to be losing track of things, and seem to be losing control of myself. It all started after my experiments with Realgar began.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11133;What... is...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11135;Many would say that experimenting on yourself is unwise, seeing as anything you do not already have an extensive knowledge of might turn out to be dangerous in a large enough quantity. However, it makes it easier to rule out potential outside factors, as you usually can remember what you have been doing aside from drinking potions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11135;Discovery requires experimentation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11135;I'm not sure this is a good idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11136;Now that I have decided to test some potions on myself I need to decide what the main ingredient or ingredients should be. I might learn new things using anything, but some choices might prove more dangerous to my health than others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11136;I wonder what I can do with some [GetSelectedIngredient_1]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11136;[GetSelectedIngredient_2] still holds many secrets...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11136;I should use them both!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11137;I have started to brew the first potion. Now I need to decide how I want to proceed with the experiment. A riskier approach might provide more information, but a safer approach might be better for my health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11137;Safety and moderation is key!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11137;I should do thorough testing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11137;Any risk is acceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_11137;I will show them ALL!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11139;The potions I have been testing over the past few weeks have yielded a number of useful insights into how I might use certain ingredients to create various beneficial potions in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_11141;The potions I have been testing over the past few weeks have yielded a number of useful insights. Whether they are best used to heal or to harm is unclear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11141;I'm making a note here: Huge success!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11142;I have gained a few useful insights into how to create more beneficial potions in the future from the potions I have tested over the past few weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11142;An acceptable outcome...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11143;I have gained a few useful insights into how to create more beneficial poisons in the future from the potions I have tested over the past few weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11143;An acceptable outcome...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11144;I have gained a few useful insights from the potions I have tested over the past few weeks. I am unsure if they are more useful when it comes to healing than harming someone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11144;An acceptable outcome...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11145;Despite testing a number of different potion recipes and using different dosages I have barely gained any useful insights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11145;Useless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11146;Despite testing a number of different potion recipes and using different dosages I have barely gained any useful insights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_11147;Useless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11148;I have had no luck with the potions I have been testing. It seems everything I have achieved is just repeating old experiments, whether my own or those of others. Surely a breakthrough is just around the corner!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11148;I must be missing something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11149;Failure. The potion I tried today had little effect, as did the one yesterday and the ones last week. The only thing I have achieved is wasting valuable ingredients and valuable time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11149;I am a failure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11150;It seems something in the potions I have been drinking lately has been quite beneficial, as my fever finally has broken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11150;Success!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11151;The potions I have been drinking over the last few weeks have made me rather sleepy, and I have had trouble focusing as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11151;So... tired...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11152;I have been inhaling a lot of fumes while brewing my potions. They have not made me feel unwell, but they have made it somewhat hard for me to stay focused.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11152;They make me feel funny;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11153;I do not know if it the potions I have been consuming lately or something else, but I am experiencing some nausea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11153;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11154;One side effect of the Hibiscus-rich potions that I have been consuming lately seems to be that I no longer feel stressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11154;I feel like a new person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_11155;This morning, I was starting to suspect that I was pregnant with [father_of_child.GetBestName]'s child, and I might well have been, but as of right now I can say for sure that I am not pregnant. I suspect the Hibiscus in the potions I have been consuming lately might be to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_11155;It seems my pregnancy with [father_of_child.GetBestName]'s child has come to an unexpected, premature end.  I suspect the Hibiscus in the potions I have been consuming lately might be to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11155;I can't be sure, but I might have been...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11155;My baby...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11155;Perhaps for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11156;I have been having some very troublesome bowel movements ever since I started drinking my new potions. I suspect the Ginger Root in them might be to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11156;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11157;My throat is feeling rather tight at the moment. I am not certain, but the problem seems to have arisen after I started experimenting with new potions. The Mandrake in them might be to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11157;Can't... breathe...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11158;The more potions I consume, the harder it gets to keep my meals down. The Mandrake in them might possibly be to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11158;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11159;I have been having some very troublesome bowel movements ever since I started drinking my new potions. I suspect the Mandrake in them might be to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11159;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11160;I have started experiencing some confusing hallucinations lately. It started at some point after I started consuming my new potions, which might point to the Mandrake in them being the cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11160;What's real?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11161;My vision is quite blurry at the moment. If I am reading my notes correctly, the problem arose after I consumed the first potion with Mandrake in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11161;I can barely see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11162;One side effect of the Lemon Grass-rich potions that I have been consuming lately seems to be that I no longer feel stressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11162;I feel like a new person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11163;I spilled a potion the other day, and some of it got into my infected wound. I was fearing that it would make the infection worse, but instead it seems to have had the opposite effect. It might be due to the Lemon Grass I put into the potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11163;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11164;Somewhat embarrassingly, the most noteworthy outcome of my experimentation with Nettles is that I have developed a rash. The potions have done nothing of note.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11164;I should have known better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11165;I had a severe hangover this morning, but it vanished almost as quickly as I consumed the first of my Wormwood-rich potions. There might be a correlation between the potion and the hangover disappearing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11165;Amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11166;I have been sleeping very well lately. This seems to have started after I drank the first potion with Wormwood in it, so the experiment must be deemed a success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11166;I feel like a new person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11167;I have had a headache come and go for several weeks now, and only today I realized that it first appeared after I consumed a Valerian-rich potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11167;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11168;I have been having some very troublesome bowel movements ever since I started drinking my new potions. I suspect the Valerian in them might be to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11168;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11169;I seem to have developed a rash on my skin lately. I strongly suspect that it is due to me not being careful when putting the Yarrow in my potions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11169;This is not ideal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11170;The more potions I consume, the harder it gets to keep my meals down. The Yarrow in them might possibly be to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11170;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11171;I have been having some very troublesome bowel movements ever since I started drinking my new potions. I suspect the Yarrow in them might be to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11171;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11172;Somewhat embarrassingly, the most noteworthy outcome of my experimentation with Ivy is that I have developed a rash. The potions have done nothing of note.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11172;I should have known better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11173;I have started experiencing some confusing hallucinations lately. It started at some point after I started consuming my new potions, which might point to the Foxglove in them being the cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11173;What's real?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11174;My vision is quite blurry at the moment. If I am reading my notes correctly, the problem arose after I consumed the first potion with Foxglove in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11174;I can barely see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11175;I have been boiling and burning various herbs to put in my potions, and the resulting fumes have made it rather hard to concentrate at times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11175;I feel funny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11176;As I reach for another of the Eyeballs I have set aside for my potions I realize that it looks rather more like a human eye than the eye of some animal, which is very strange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11176;I will throw it away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11176;I must be imagining things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11176;I HAVE HIS EYE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11177;I hesitate for a fraction of a moment before throwing the strange eyeball away, but the feeling that I might want to keep it passes. The next one I select for my potion seems perfectly normal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11177;Back to work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11178;I move to throw away the strange eyeball, but then I feel myself hesitating. Surely there is no harm in keeping it around, even if it should not go in my next potion...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11178;I can't just throw it away...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11179;The strange eyeball is still on my table. I have found myself unwilling to move it, for whatever reason. Glancing at it, I feel as if it is looking me directly in one of my eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11179;I will look away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11179;I must be imagining things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11179;HE SEES ME!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11180;I find it strangely difficult to pull my gaze away, but eventually I manage to do it. Something strange is going on. Without hesitation, I smash the eyeball into a bloody pulp, then throw away the remnants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11180;Back to work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11181;I cannot look away. The eye sees me. I see the eye. It surely holds many secrets, secrets that could be mine. Letting it watch me and my work is not going to be a problem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11181;I see how it is...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11182;The strange eye seems to be emitting a fiery glow. Something about it is not quite right, even if I cannot quite say what it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11182;I must destroy this evil thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11182;I must be imagining things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11182;HIS POWER IS UNDENIABLE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11183;It is one of the most difficult things I have ever done, but I manage to smash the eyeball into a bloody pulp. I do not feel fully at ease until I have thrown away the remnants and cleaned away all the stains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11183;That felt weird...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11184;The eye is strange, yes, but strange things are not always harmful. The fiery glow is only a sign that it is powerful, and that is not a bad thing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11184;I must not destroy it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11185;For some reason, I found myself picking up the strange eye today. Perhaps its power could be mine if I used it as a replacement for one of my own eyes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11185;This is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11185;It must be done...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11185;I DO THIS FOR HIM!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11186;My hand has gone for one of my eyes before I realize what is happening, but I manage to stop myself from tearing it out. The strange eye somehow seems to be fighting me, but I have finally had enough of it. I throw it on the floor and stomp on it, utterly destroying it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11186;That... that was a close one...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11187;It is painful to tear out my own eye, but pain is temporary. Power is eternal, and with the Eye I shall have more of it than I ever could have imagined before!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11187;YES! YES!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11189;For some reason I find myself compelled to lift the eyepatch that [From.GetBestName]'s corpse is wearing. The eye underneath it is alive, and as it looks into one of my eyes I realize that it is powerful. Its power could surely be mine, if only I sacrifice one of my own eyes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11189;This is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11189;It must be done...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11189;I DO THIS FOR HIM!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11190;My hand has gone for one of my eyes before I realize what is happening, but I manage to stop myself from tearing it out. The strange eye somehow seems to be fighting me, but I have finally had enough of it. I throw it on the floor and stomp on it, utterly destroying it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11190;That... that was a close one...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11191;It is painful to tear out my own eye, but pain is temporary. Power is eternal, and with the Eye I shall have more of it than I ever could have imagined before!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11191;YES! YES!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11192;My potions have not resulted in any particularly noteworthy insights into the ingredients I have been using. Perhaps I would learn more from eating some of them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11192;I doubt it would help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11192;Well, maybe it will work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11193;To my surprise, the improvised meal I create from the animal parts I was working with turns out pretty decent. I do not get any insights from the meal itself, but as I eat I realize that I had missed a few things before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11193;That worked out okay...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11194;While the improvised meal I make does not make me ill, I feel rather queasy from it. I do not think I gained any particular insights as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11194;That was a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11195;Something about the improvised meal I had disagreed with me. I do not feel well at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11195;I should not have eaten that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11196;I find it hard to keep the improvised meal I made down, and it is safe to say that I made a mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11196;I should not have eaten that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11197;Though I am able to keep the improvised meal I had down, it has resulted in me having some rather troubling bowel movements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11197;I should not have eaten that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11198;Today one of the servants gave out a yelp when [Root.GetSheHe] saw me. [Root.GetSheHeCap] suggested I might want to look in a mirror. It turns out something strange has happened to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11198;I'm... blue?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11199;I am feeling physically weaker than before. It is quite possible the Mercury I have been putting in my potions is to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11199;I feel so weak...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11200;I have gotten a severe headache, and it seems to be getting worse with each passing day. I am starting to suspect that the Mercury I have been putting in my potions might be what is behind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11200;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11201;I seem to have developed a rash of some kind after spilling a potion on my skin. The most likely cause would be the Mercury I put in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11201;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11202;I have found myself struggling with remembering things recently. I do not quite remember when it started, but it possibly was after I consumed the first Mercury-rich potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11202;What's going on...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11203;I can feel the eyes of my servants and courtiers following me wherever I go. They surely seek to discover what I have learned from my Mercury-rich potions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11203;They're after my secrets!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11204;My vision is quite blurry at the moment. If I am reading my notes correctly, the problem arose after I consumed the first potion with Mercury in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11204;I can barely see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11205;I seem to have trouble forming proper sentences recently. It is possible it started after I had the first Mercury-rich potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11205;Not right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_11206;Though not everything I have read on the subject agrees, there are some alchemists that claim that some ingredients, such as Mercury and Cinnabar, can cause problems for the unborn children of women that come into contact with it. I am not sure yet, but it is possible I carry [father_of_child.GetBestName]'s child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_11206;Though not everything I have read on the subject agrees, there are some alchemists that claim that some ingredients, such as Mercury and Cinnabar, can cause problems for the unborn children of women that come into contact with it. I did not remember this when I began my laboratory experiment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11206;This might be a problem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11206;I should have been more careful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11207;I have been feeling unwell lately. It seems to have started after I had the first potion with Mercury in it, but the correlation might be a coincidence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11207;What's happening to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11208;Not everyone respects alchemists such as me! Fools, all of them! They think us mad! They think they know better! They claim Mercury is dangerous! They are wrong! I will show them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11208;I will show them ALL!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11209;I barely had time to react when the Aqua Fortis I was preparing for my latest potion exploded, sending shards of broken glass flying in all directions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11209;Take cover!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11210;I have been noticing a strange smell ever since I had the first Brimstone-rich potion. It seems to be present wherever I go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11210;Is it me...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11211;I spilled some of my latest potion on my skin, and now I seem to be developing some kind of rash. It might be due to the Brimstone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11211;That's not great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11212;I have been having some very troublesome bowel movements ever since I started drinking my new potions. I suspect the Brimstone in them might be to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11212;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11213;As I was carrying preparing my latest Brimstone-rich potion I felt something get in one of my eyes and decided to scratch it. Whatever initially was in my eye quickly became the least of my worries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11213;My eye!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11214;Today the potion I was brewing in my kettle unexpectedly exploded, sending the Brimstone-rich liquid inside flying in all directions. I got some on my skin, and the result was anything but pretty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11214;My face!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11215;The more potions I consume, the harder it gets to keep my meals down. The Copper in them might possibly be to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11215;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11216;The more potions I consume, the harder it gets to keep my meals down. The Tin in them might possibly be to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11216;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11217;I have been having some very troublesome bowel movements ever since I started drinking my new potions. I suspect the Tin in them might be to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11217;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11218;I have been feeling a fairly severe pain in my stomach lately. It started at some potion after I started drinking my Lead-rich potions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11218;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_11219;This morning, I was starting to suspect that I was pregnant with [father_of_child.GetBestName]'s child, and I might well have been, but as of right now I can say for sure that I am not pregnant. Possibly, the Lead in my potions is to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_11219;It seems my pregnancy with [father_of_child.GetBestName]'s child has come to an unexpected, premature end. Possibly, the Lead in my potions is to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11219;I can't be sure, but I might have been...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11219;My baby...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11219;Perhaps for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11220;I have found myself struggling with remembering things recently. I do not quite remember when it started, but it possibly was after I consumed the first Lead-rich potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11220;What's going on...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11221;I have started experiencing some confusing hallucinations lately. It started at some point after I started consuming my new potions, which might point to the Lead in them being the cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11221;What's real?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11222;Ever since I started having my potions with Lead in them I have noticed that I long for physical contact rather less than I have in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11222;One less thing to distract me from my experiments, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11223;I have been feeling quite a bit of nausea lately. Perhaps it is due to the Lead in the potions I have been consuming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11223;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11224;Ever since I started consuming potions with plenty of Lead in them I have been sleeping poorly. It might be a coincidence, but there might also be a correlation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11224;So... tired...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11225;I am feeling physically weaker than before. It is quite possible the Lead I have been putting in my potions is to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11225;I feel so weak...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11226;I have been having some very troublesome bowel movements ever since I started drinking my new potions. I suspect the Lead in them might be to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11226;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11227;I have lost quite a bit of weight since started drinking my Lead-rich potions. Perhaps there is no correlation, but it might not just be a coincidence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11227;This might be bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11228;I find myself with a quite severe headache, and it does not seem to be going away anytime soon. The Antimony in my potions could perhaps be the cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11228;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11229;I have not had any great breakthroughs since I started consuming the Antimony-rich potions I prepared. I might be wasting my life on worthless experiment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11229;It's all pointless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11230;I have been feeling a bit dizzy lately. I suspect it might be due to the Antimony I have been putting in my potions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11230;Steady now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11231;The more potions I consume, the harder it gets to keep my meals down. The Antimony in them might possibly be to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11231;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11232;I have developed some kind of rash after I spilled a potion on my spin the other day. It might be due to the Cobalt in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11232;That's not great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11233;I have developed some kind of rash after I spilled a potion on my spin the other day. It might be due to the Nickel in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11233;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11234;The more potions I consume, the harder it gets to keep my meals down. The Blue Vitriol in them might possibly be to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11234;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11235;I have been noticing a strange smell ever since I had the first Blue Vitriol-rich potion. It seems to be present wherever I go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11235;Is it me...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11236;I spilled some Blue Vitriol-rich potion on my skin the other day, and now I seem to have developed some kind of rash.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_11248;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11249;I barely had time to react when the Saltpeter I was preparing for my latest potion exploded, sending shards of broken glass flying in all directions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11249;Take cover!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11250;I have been noticing a strange smell ever since I had the first Cinnabar-rich potion. It seems to be present wherever I go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11250;Is it me...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_11253;Today the potion I was brewing in my kettle unexpectedly exploded, sending the Cinnabar-rich liquid inside flying in all directions. I got some on my skin, and the result was anything but pretty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_11255;I am having the most severe headache I have ever had. It might have something to do with the Cinnabar I have been putting in my potions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11255;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11256;I seem to have developed a rash of some kind after spilling a potion on my skin. The most likely cause would be the Cinnabar I put in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11256;That's not great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11257;I have found myself struggling with remembering things recently. I do not quite remember when it started, but it possibly was after I consumed the first Cinnabar-rich potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11257;What's going on...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11258;I can feel the eyes of my servants and courtiers following me wherever I go. They surely seek to discover what I have learned from my Cinnabar-rich potions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11258;They're after my secrets!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11259;My vision is quite blurry at the moment. If I am reading my notes correctly, the problem arose after I consumed the first potion with Cinnabar in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11259;I can barely see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11260;I seem to have trouble forming proper sentences recently. It is possible it started after I had the first Mercury-rich potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11260;Not right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11261;I have been feeling unwell lately. It seems to have started after I had the first potion with Mercury in it, but the correlation might be a coincidence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11261;What's happening to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11262;Not everyone respects alchemists such as me! Fools, all of them! They think us mad! They think they know better! They claim Cinnabar is dangerous! They are wrong! I will show them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11262;I will show them ALL!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11263;I have been feeling a pain in my stomach recently, and it has only been getting worse. I suspect that the Realgar in my potions might be the cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11263;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11264;I have been having some very troublesome bowel movements ever since I started drinking my new potions. I suspect the Realgar in them might be to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11264;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11265;The more potions I consume, the harder it gets to keep my meals down. The Realgar in them might possibly be to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11265;I don't feel great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11266;I seem to be losing track of things, and seem to be losing control of myself. It all started after the first potion with Realgar in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11266;What... is...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11268;[experimenting_alchemist.GetBestName] has approached me with an unconventional suggestion: [experimenting_alchemist.GetSheHeCap] will set me free if I agree to first test out one of [experimenting_alchemist.GetHerHis] new alchemical potions. I have no way of knowing whether the potion will be dangerous or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11268;It is worth the risk...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11268;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11269;[From.GetBestName] has refused to take part in the experiment I proposed, bluntly telling me that [From.GetSheHe] does not want to risk poisoning [From.GetHerHim]self just to satisfy my curiosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11269;But it's for science!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11270;[From.GetBestName] has agreed to take part in the experiment I proposed. Now I just need to decide what the main ingredient in the potions I will offer [From.GetHerHim] will be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11270;I wonder what a potion containing [GetSelectedIngredient_1] will do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11270;[GetSelectedIngredient_2] might be interesting to test...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11270;I should use them both!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11271;[experimenting_alchemist.GetBestName] has presented me with four different potions, telling me to pick one of them. [experimenting_alchemist.GetSheHeCap] claims [experimenting_alchemist.GetSheHe] has no idea which is which or what they will do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11271;I will go with the first potion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11271;I suppose the second potion will do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11271;The third potion will set me free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_11271;I guess the fourth potion is as good as any...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11272;[From.GetBestName] has selected one of the potions I offered [From.GetHerHim]. Once [From.GetSheHe] has consumed it we will wait for a week to see what the results are, and then [From.GetSheHe] will be released... if [From.GetSheHe] still is alive, of course...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11272;Let the experiment begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11274;I have been wondering what the potion I drank would do ever since I drank it. I can now tell that it seems to have been a very beneficial potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11274;I feel amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11275;The guards that have been monitoring [From.GetBestName] for me has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] seems to be doing quite well. In fact, [From.GetSheHe] seems to be doing better than before [From.GetSheHe] had the potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11275;That was not my hypothesis...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11275;[From.GetSheHeCap] has proven a useful test subject...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11276;I have been wondering what the potion I drank would do ever since I drank it. I can now tell that it seems to have been a fairly beneficial potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11276;I feel better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11277;The guards that have been monitoring [From.GetBestName] for me has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] seems to be doing fairly well. In fact, [From.GetSheHe] seems to be doing slightly better than before [From.GetSheHe] had the potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11277;A possible outlier...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_11278;I have been wondering what the potion I drank would do ever since I drank it. It has made me slightly queasy, but nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11278;I feel a bit odd...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11279;The guards that have been monitoring [From.GetBestName] for me has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] seems to be slightly queasy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_11280;I have been wondering what the potion I drank would do ever since I drank it. It seems like it is making it hard for me to keep my meals down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_11290;Is that me...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11291;The guards that have been monitoring [From.GetBestName] for me has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] seems to be smelling quite unpleasantly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_11293;The guards that have been monitoring [From.GetBestName] for me has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] seems to be doing a bit poorly, and certainly somewhat worse than before [From.GetSheHe] had the potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_11297;The guards that have been monitoring [From.GetBestName] for me has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] has died. It seems the potion was a very effective poison.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11297;Thank you for your contributions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11298;A message has arrived from [experimenting_alchemist.GetBestName], bearing a different message from the one I was expecting. It seems [From.GetSheHe] intends to keep me in this cell in case [From.GetSheHe] needs a test subject again in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11298;No! [From.GetSheHeCap] promised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11299;There are several different lifestyles I could devote myself to that might benefit me depending on my approach to alchemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11299;As a Mystic I will combine alchemy with spiritual aid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11299;As a Gardener I will be in abetter position to acquire alchemical herbs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11299;Only a Master Schemer can fully benefit from alchemical poisons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_11299;None of them sound very appealing right now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11300;While my current lifestyle certainly is helpful when it comes to some matters related to alchemy, perhaps there is another that might suit me better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11300;As a Mystic I will combine alchemy with spiritual aid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11300;As a Gardener I will be in abetter position to acquire alchemical herbs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11300;Only a Master Schemer can fully benefit from alchemical poisons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_11300;Actually, I see little reason to change...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11301;Before I start brewing my healing potion I need to decide on what the primary ingredient or ingredients should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11301;I should put some [GetSelectedIngredient_1] in it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11301;I think I will go with [GetSelectedIngredient_2]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11301;Using them both would be best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SOH_11304;What a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11306;It took some time for my healing potion to have an effect, but it has definitely made me feel a lot better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_11314;It seems the healing potion I gave to [From.GetBestName] has had no effect at all on [From.GetHerHis] health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11314;Strange...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11315;It took some time for my healing potion to have an effect, and it has unfortunately made me feel a bit worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11315;Did I get the dosage wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_11338;That did not go according to plan...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11339;Life seems pointless once again. It seemed like that had changed after I drank a clarity potion, but that feeling has passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_11345;Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11345;I don't trust that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11346;[From.GetBestName] refused to drink the fertility potion I offered [From.GetHerHim], claiming that it looked somewhat suspicious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11346;I guess I should drink it, then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11346;What a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11347;[From.GetBestName] has consumed the fertility potion I gave [From.GetHerHim]. Whether it will work out or not is unclear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11347;I will not pry into the matter...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11349;Ever since I drank that healing potion I have kept on having some rather lewd thoughts about various attractive people around, and have started to feel like I should act on them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11349;I think the potion helped!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11350;I feel rather more energetic than before I had that healing potion. I really should use that energy in the bedroom, together with a willing partner or three.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11350;I think the potion helped!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11351;I would have expected the fertility potion I drank to have had some kind of effect by now, but it does not seem to have done anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11351;I don't feel different...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11352;I feel rather less energetic than before I had that healing potion, particularly when my thoughts turn to what I might do in the bedroom with a willing partner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11352;The potion seems to have had the opposite effect...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11353;I seem to be having rather fewer distracting thoughts about the attractive people around me than before I had that healing potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11353;The potion seems to have had the opposite effect...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11355;Before I start brewing my aphrodisiac I need to decide on what the primary ingredient or ingredients should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11355;I should put some [GetSelectedIngredient_1] in it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11355;I think I will go with [GetSelectedIngredient_2]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11355;Using them both would be best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_11355;Actually, I have changed my mind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11356;Before I start brewing an aphrodisiac for [potion_target.GetBestName] I need to decide on what the primary ingredient or ingredients should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11356;I should put some [GetSelectedIngredient_1] in it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11356;I think I will go with [GetSelectedIngredient_2]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11356;Using them both would be best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_11356;Actually, I have changed my mind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11357;[From.GetBestName] has presented me with what [From.GetSheHe] claims is an aphrodisiac. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] thinks I would be interested in one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11357;Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11357;I don't trust that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11358;[From.GetBestName] refused to drink the aphrodisiac I offered [From.GetHerHim], claiming that it looked somewhat suspicious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11358;I guess I should drink it, then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11358;What a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11359;[From.GetBestName] has consumed the aphrodisiac I gave [From.GetHerHim]. Whether it will work out or not is unclear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11359;I will not pry into the matter...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11361;The aphrodisiac I consumed really seems to be having an effect. Today [possible_lover.GetBestName] approached me and very bluntly propositioned me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11361;What took you so long?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11361;I'm sorry, but I don't like you that way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11362;There has been something different about [From.GetBestName] lately. I find myself a lot more attracted to [From.GetHerHim], for one thing. Maybe I should suggest spending some time together in private, to truly show my newfound appreciation of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11362;I will approach [From.GetHerHim] at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11362;No, that would be a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11363;Today [From.GetBestName] approached me and told me that [From.GetSheHe] has a newfound appreciation for me. [From.GetSheHeCap] suggested we should retire somewhere private so that [From.GetSheHe] truly could show [From.GetHerHis] appreciation. I think the aphrodisiac I consumed worked!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11363;An excellent idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11363;I am busy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11364;[From.GetBestName] was very receptive to my suggestion, and was quite willing to show [From.GetHerHis] appreciation of me as well once we were in a private location.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11364;That was very nice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11365;[From.GetBestName] informed me that [From.GetSheHe] was busy and implied that [From.GetSheHe] would come find me should [From.GetSheHe] have the time, but that I perhaps should not sit around and wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11365;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11366;I am finding [From.GetBestName] even more enticing than usual lately. Perhaps I should suggest that we should spend some time together, just the two of us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11366;That's a great idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11366;No, I think not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11367;[From.GetBestName] approached me today and suggested that we should retire somewhere private. The way [From.GetSheHe] was acting, I think the aphrodisiac I consumed must be working!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11367;That's a wonderful idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11367;I am busy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11368;[From.GetBestName] was very receptive to my suggestion, and we quickly made our way to a private location and spent a wonderful night in each other's company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11368;That worked out well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11369;[From.GetBestName] turned down my suggestion, telling me that [From.GetSheHe] was busy at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11369;Maybe later?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11370;The aphrodisiac I consumed seems to have had a positive effect. The courtiers all around me seem to be paying a lot more attention to me, including several I find very attractive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11370;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11371;I have been feeling a lot more confident ever since I consumed that aphrodisiac, certain that I will receive a lot more romantic attention than I did in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11371;They will notice me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11372;The aphrodisiac I consumed should probably have had an effect by now, but so far it does not seem to have done anything at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11372;I expected... something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11373;I have been noticing a strange smell ever since I consumed that aphrodisiac. Today I realized that it might be following me around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11373;Is that me...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11374;It seems people are paying more attention to me ever since I consumed that aphrodisiac, but the attention I have been receiving does not seem like the kind of attention I want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11374;This is not great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11375;Everywhere I go, people seem repulsed by my presence. I suspect something might be very wrong with the aphrodisiac I consumed a while back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11375;This is awful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11376;Lately, I have been feeling that [From.GetBestName]'s presence is almost repulsive to me. [From.GetHerHisCap] appearance and personality has not changed, but something about [From.GetHerHim] is different, and not in a good way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11376;I will break things off!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11376;Maybe it will pass...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11377;Today [From.GetBestName] bluntly informed me that [From.GetSheHe] no longer is interested in me, stating that something has been different about me, and not at all in a good way. It seems the aphrodisiac I consumed did the opposite of what it was supposed to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11377;Horrible news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11379;[interviewer.GetSocietyRank] [interviewer.GetBestName] has requested to interview me, as is [interviewer.GetHerHis] right. Doubtlessly, [interviewer.GetSheHe] seeks to gain a better understanding of what I know about alchemical matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11379;Very well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11379;Absolutely not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11380;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] will not let me interview [From.GetHerHim]. Whether it is due to personal dislike, an unwillingness to share [From.GetHerHis] discoveries, or something else is unclear, but [From.GetSheHe] is not treating me with proper respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11380;The Renowned Apothecary Society will hear of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11381;[From.GetBestName] has agreed to the interview I requested. Now I need to decide what I wish to question [From.GetHerHim] about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11381;Tell me about how to heal people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11381;Surely you know a thing or two about poisons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_11382;Once I arrive for the interview [From.GetBestName] informs me that [From.GetSheHe] is interested in learning what I know about how to heal people with alchemical potions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_11382;Once I arrive for the interview [From.GetBestName] informs me that [From.GetSheHe] is interested in learning what I know about the poisonous effects of various alchemical ingredients.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11382;I will share all I know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11382;Every other word I say will be a lie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11382;I will share some of what I know...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_11382;I will tell as little as possible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11383;[From.GetBestName] has been very forthcoming as to what [From.GetSheHe] knows about the subject at hand. Clearly, [From.GetSheHe] does not wish to keep [From.GetHerHis] knowledge to [From.GetHerHim]self.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11383;This deserves proper recognition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11383;We are done here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11384;[From.GetBestName] was very satisfied with what I told [From.GetHerHim] and informed me that [From.GetSheHe] would make sure that all of the Renowned Apothecary Society learns how cooperative I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11384;It's nice to be appreciated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11384;What a gullible fool!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11385;Something is very wrong about what [From.GetBestName] is telling me. While it is possible that [From.GetSheHe] is ignorant, [From.GetSheHe] might also be lying through [From.GetHerHis] teeth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11385;You lie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11385;I can't be sure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11386;[From.GetBestName] has publicly announced that I lied to [From.GetHerHim] during the interview. [From.GetSheHeCap] has not provided any proof, but as [From.GetSheHe] is greatly respected among the ranks of the Renowned Apothecary Society my reputation has suffered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11386;That's not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11387;[From.GetBestName] shared some useful things. I did not learn as much as I expected, but perhaps [From.GetSheHe] did not know as much as I thought, or perhaps I simply asked the wrong questions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11387;We are done here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11388;[From.GetBestName] has told me very little of use, and I get the feeling that [From.GetSheHe] might be holding back. We all have our secrets, of course, but I expected better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11388;I will not make a big deal out of it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11388;You must be holding back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11388;I will accuse [From.GetHerHim] of being lacking in knowledge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11389;[From.GetBestName] has ended our interview, telling me that there is not much point to it if I refuse to share anything that I know, and that I really should have told [From.GetHerHim] more than I did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11389;You don't deserve my knowledge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11389;It must be kept secret!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11389;You cannot be trusted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_11389;One day I will show them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11390;It seems [From.GetBestName] has chosen to interpret my unwillingness to share what I know as me knowing very little of use, and [From.GetSheHe] has let the rest of the Renowned Apothecary Society know that my knowledge might be lacking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11390;That's not ideal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
