EVTDESC_SOH_8804;Some of the agents I have sent ashore in [rebel_province_target.GetName] have reported that the locals are not satisfied with the rule of [rebel_ruler_target.GetBestName]. Perhaps I could encourage them to rise up againt [rebel_ruler_target.GetHerHim], using the Treasure Fleet's funds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8804;Arrange for the necessary funding!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8804;I don't want to cause trouble...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8805;I have just received word that the peasants of [rebel_province_target.GetName] are unusually irate for some unknown reason. The unrest seems to have originated at some point after the Treasure Fleet's arrival, but whether that is a mere coincidence or not is impossible to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8805;Who could be behind this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8806;My agents take great care to remain undetected as they bring the necessary funds to some of the local troublemakers in [rebel_province_target.GetName]. A local official sends a letter a few days later, informing the Treasure Fleet that the current unrest makes it inadvisable for anyone to head ashore, and no blame is directed at me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8806;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8807;I have just received word that the peasants of [rebel_province_target.GetName] are unusually irate. As best anyone can tell, agents in the service of [From.GetBestName] were seen meeting with some local troublemakers a few days ago, so [From.GetSheHe] is likely behind the unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8807;Curse [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8808;My agents bring the necessary funds to some of the local troublemakers in [rebel_province_target.GetName] and then return. A local official sends a letter a few days later, informing the Treasure Fleet that the current unrest makes it inadvisable for anyone to head ashore. Unfortunately, the official seems to imply that I am to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8808;Not as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8809;I have just received word that some locals in [rebel_province_target.GetName] have discovered an attempt by some of their fellows to cause some unrest and that they have put a stop to the matter. Some unknown individual aboard the Treasure Fleet is likely behind the attempt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8809;Who could be behind this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8810;My agents return in a hurry and inform me that the locals they sought to have cause trouble in [rebel_province_target.GetName] have been rounded up by other locals. [rebel_ruler_target.GetBestName] probably knows that someone from the Treasure Fleet was behind the attempt, but likely does not know that it was me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8810;It could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8811;I have just received word that some locals in [rebel_province_target.GetName] have discovered an attempt by some of their fellows to cause some unrest and that they have put a stop to the matter. Agents known to be in the employ of [From.GetBestName] were seen meeting with the troublemakers recently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8811;Curse [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8812;My agents return in a hurry and inform me that the locals they sought to have cause trouble in [rebel_province_target.GetName] have been rounded up by other locals. [rebel_ruler_target.GetBestName] very likely knows that I was behind the attempt, seeing as some of my agents think they were recognized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8812;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8813;Part of the Treasure Fleet's mission is to ensure diplomatic cooperation between distant realms and the Middle Kingdom. In order to achieve this, several artifacts have been brought along to be offered in exchange for a token payment, and perhaps I should extend such an offer to [tf_interaction_target.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8813;I will make the offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8813;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8814;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], one of the officials travelling with the Treasure Fleet. [From.GetSheHeCap] offers to provide an artifact from the Middle Kingdom in exchange for a small payment. The message does not specify what kind of artifact it would be, but it is likely to be a rather exotic item.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8814;You have yourself a deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8814;Your terms are not acceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8815;The messenger I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to accept the proposed agreement. I give the order for an artifact to be delivered, as promised, and consider what to do with the money that has been delivered into my hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8815;I will keep the gold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8815;It belongs to the Dragon Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8816;It does not take long before a group of servants arrive from the Treasure Fleet, bringing with them the artifact that [From.GetBestName] promised to deliver, handing it over in an elaborate ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8816;I can find a use for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8817;The messenger I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in the proposed agreement. It seems [From.GetSheHe] thinks that I asked for too much money, but as I was making the offer on behalf of the Dragon Throne there were some limits imposed on my ability to negotiate the terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8817;I tried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8818;Part of the Treasure Fleet's mission is to ensure peace between the Middle Kingdom and various distant realms. As part of this task I have been authorized to enter into a small number of peace deals on behalf of the Dragon Throne for a token payment, and perhaps I should extend such an offer to [tf_interaction_target.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8818;I will make the offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8818;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8819;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], one of the officials travelling with the Treasure Fleet, who offers to enter into a peace deal with we on behalf of the Dragon Throne in exchange for a small payment. This could be useful, should the Middle Kingdom become interested in military expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_8821;I tried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8822;As one of the officials travelling with the Treasure Fleet I am able to enter into a number of agreements on behalf of the Dragon Throne, such as an open-ended one where the Dragon Throne owes a future Boon. Perhaps I should extend such an offer to [tf_interaction_target.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8822;I will make the offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8822;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8823;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], one of the officials travelling with the Treasure Fleet, who offers to draw up an agreement where the Dragon Throne owes me a future Boon in exchange for a small payment. Given that I supposedly would be able to choose what I want in the future, this could be quite beneficial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8823;You have yourself a deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8823;Your terms are not acceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8824;The messenger I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to accept the proposed agreement.

EVTOPTA_SOH_8824;I will keep the gold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8824;It belongs to the Dragon Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_8825;I tried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8826;As one of the officials travelling with the Treasure Fleet I can negotiate on behalf of the Dragon Throne when it comes to rewording existing tributary relationships. As such, I have been considering whether to offer a somewhat more generous agreement to [tf_interaction_target.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8826;I will make the offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8826;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8827;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], one of the officials travelling with the Treasure Fleet, who offers to arrange for a somewhat looser tributary relationship between my realm and the Middle Kingdom in exchange for a small payment. This could be beneficial if the current terms are too restrictive for my liking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8827;You have yourself a deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8827;Your terms are not acceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8828;The messenger I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to accept the proposed agreement.

EVTOPTA_SOH_8829;I tried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8830;Though most of the people that travel with the Treasure Fleet plan to return to the Middle Kingdom in the future there are certain travellers that have expressed an interest in staying behind. I could offer to arrange for someone to agree to work for [tf_interaction_target.GetBestName], in exchange for a small payment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8830;I will make the offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8830;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8831;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], one of the officials travelling with the Treasure Fleet, who wishes to let me know that there is an individual from the Middle Kingdom that might be willing to work for me, in exchange for a small payment to [From.GetBestName]. Such an individual might perhaps be useful, in one way or another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8831;You have yourself a deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8831;Your terms are not acceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_8843;I tried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8844;Though the Treasure Fleet was well provisioned when it left the Middle Kingdom, the supplies are starting to dwindle, and as such it would be prudent to resupply. [tf_interaction_target.GetBestName] surely has the required supplies on hand, ready to be acquired by the Treasure Fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8844;Let us try a diplomatic approach!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8844;I will have the soldiers seize them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_8844;We have enough supplies...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8845;A messenger arrived from [From.GetBestName], requesting permission for the Treasure Fleet to resupply in my lands. A small amount of money is being offered in return, along with the gratitude of the Dragon Throne, which perhaps could prove to be rather useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8845;You have yourself a deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8845;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8846;The messenger I sent to [From.GetBestName] returns with word that the Treasure Fleet will be permitted to resupply according to my request. A small monetary payment must be made, of course, but the Treasure Fleet was provided with funds for such eventualities, so it is a trivial thing to arrange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8846;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8847;The messenger I sent to [From.GetBestName] returns with word that the Treasure Fleet will not be permitted to resupply as I requested. The only option that remains to me if I wish to acquire the supplies at this time is to use force, which is less certain to work well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8847;Make ready to attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8847;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8848;I lead a small detachment of soldiers ashore under the cover of darkness, planning to take what we need from some granaries located near the shoreline. Everything goes according to plan, and we soon return to the fleet as many supplies as the soldiers can carry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8848;Just as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8849;I lead a small detachment of soldiers ashore under the cover of darkness, planning to take what we need from some granaries located near the shoreline. Unfortunately, the granaries are more heavily guarded than expected, and though I manage to make my way back to the fleet many soldiers are captured or killed in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8849;That went... poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8850;I lead a small detachment of soldiers ashore under the cover of darkness, planning to take what we need from some granaries located near the shoreline. Unfortunately, the locals have set a trap, and I and my soldiers are easily captured and dragged away in chains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8850;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8851;I am awakened early in the morning by a servant bringing word that a messenger has arrived with word that the granaries near the shoreline were attacked during the night, and that a substantial amount of grain has been taken. It is quite clear that the Treasure Fleet was behind the attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8851;Bandits, the lot of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8852;I am awakened early in the morning by a servant bringing word that a messenger has arrived with word that the granaries near the shoreline were attacked during the night, but that the attackers were driven off or captured. It seems the Treasure Fleet was behind the attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8852;Good work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8853;I am awakened early in the morning by a servant bringing word that a messenger has arrived with word that the granaries near the shoreline were attacked during the night, but that the guards posted there had set a trap and captured those responsible, including [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8853;I will deal with you appropriately...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8854;It is only right and proper for foreign realms to pay tribute to the Dragon Throne, and though it is preferable for them to do so willingly it might be necessary to use force to compel them. I am in a position to attempt to compel [tf_interaction_target.GetBestName] to pay tribute, should I wish to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8854;The Dragon Throne would approve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8854;It sounds like a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8855;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], an official travelling aboard the Treasure Fleet. [From.GetSheHeCap] suggests that it is in my best interests to enter into a tributary relationship with the Dragon Throne, with the implication being that a refusal might result in an attempt to compel me by force of arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8855;I cannot refuse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8855;Do your worst!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8856;The messenger I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned, bringing word that [From.GetSheHe] wisely has seen fit to enter into a tributary relationship with the Dragon Throne. It is unlikely that the threat of force was appreciated, but sometimes the ends might justify some rather unsavory means.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8856;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8857;The messenger you I to [From.GetBestName] has returned, bringing word that [From.GetSheHe] is unwilling to enter into a tributary relationship with the Dragon Throne. It seems I will have to resort to military means to achieve such a tributary relationship, if I think that is a wise course of action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8857;[From.GetSheHeCap] has left me no choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8857;Never mind, then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8858;As one of the officials travelling with the Treasure Fleet I am able to arrange for the craftsmen that have accompanied it to construct certain things in the area to leave a more lasting reminder of the Middle Kingdom's greatness. I could perhaps offer to construct such a building in the lands of [tf_interaction_target.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8858;I will make the offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8858;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8859;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], an official travelling aboard the Treasure Fleet. [From.GetSheHeCap] offers to arrange for some craftsmen from the Middle Kingdom to construct something useful in my lands in exchange for a small monetary payment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8859;You have yourself a deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8859;Your terms are not acceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8860;The messenger I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned, bringing with him a small monetary payment. I give the order for the craftsmen accompanying the fleet to construct something, with the specifics left being left to their best judgement, and consider what I should do with the money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8860;I will keep the gold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8860;It belongs to the Dragon Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8861;The craftsmen from the Treasure Fleet arrive promptly and work quickly, only requesting that they are not disturbed and that they are provided with food and water.

EVTOPTA_SOH_8865;That worked out quite well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8866;The messenger I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned, informing me that [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to refuse the offer.

EVTOPTA_SOH_8866;I tried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8867;Today [new_tf_character.GetBestName], a minor noble[new_tf_character.GetManWoman] from [tf_noble_province.GetName] approached me and requested permission to accompany me and the Treasure Fleet.

EVTOPTA_SOH_8867;Welcome aboard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8867;Get off my ship!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8868;I have been spending some time ashore in several ports in the area where the Treasure Fleet currently is located, trying to learn a little about the foreign ways of the locals. I have learned quite a bit about the [tf_sympathy_target.Religion.GetName] faith as a result, and have a newfound appreciation for it as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8868;Their ways are interesting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8869;As I am returning to the Treasure Fleet after spending a day ashore I am approached by [target_noble.GetBestName].

EVTDESC_SOH_8870;I have just learned that [target_noble.GetBestName] has seen fit to pledge [target_noble.GetHerHim]self to [From.GetBestName], apparently having decided that travelling with the Treasure Fleet and seeing the splendour of the Middle Kingdom is in [target_noble.GetHerHis] interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8870;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8871;I have taken the opportunity to inspect some of the buildings in the ports the Treasure Fleet has visited lately. The local construction techniques are fairly different from those we use at home, but many of the buildings are still rather beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8871;Perhaps some of this would work at home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8872;I have recently ended up spending quite some time talking to carpenters, masons, and others interested in construction in the ports the Treasure Fleet has visited as some of the others aboard the ships have let slip that I am a renowned architect. My input has certainly been appreciated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8872;I'd be happy to help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8873;I have spent the last few days ashore scouring the countryside for unfamiliar plants not found near [Root.Capital.GetName]. Some of the locals were happy to direct me to where they might be found, and helpfully pointed out some of the poisonous ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8873;I found some interesting ones!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8874;Today some of the locals invited me and a few others from the Treasure Fleet to take part in a hunt. Some of the others saw fit to refuse, considering it unseemly to hunt alongside foreign barbarians, but I accepted the offer, and it certainly was worthwhile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8874;Such interesting beasts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8875;Today some of the locals brought some animals from a recent hunt to the market in the port my ship had docked in. Noticing my interest in the animals, they asked me if they were anything like those I have encountered near [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8875;We've got much larger beasts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8875;We've got all kinds of fantastical beasts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_8875;I think they are largely similar...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8876;As I was returning to my ship after spending the day ashore I came across [treasure_fleet_lover.GetBestName], a rather interesting [treasure_fleet_lover.GetManWoman]. We started talking, and I got the sense that [treasure_fleet_lover.GetSheHe] might be interested in me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8876;I will proposition [treasure_fleet_lover.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8876;I have other things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8877;I came across [From.GetBestName] as [From.GetSheHe] was returning to the Treasure Fleet and started talking to [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] seemed quite taken with me from the start, and it was not particularly surprising when [From.GetSheHe] invited me to spend the night aboard [From.GetHerHis] ship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8877;I like the way you think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8877;Absolutely not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8878;[treasure_fleet_lover.GetBestName] started backing away from me before I had finished making my suggestion and told me in no uncertain terms that [treasure_fleet_lover.GetSheHe] has no interest whatsoever in spending the night with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8878[treasure_fleet_lover.GetMenWomen]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8879;[treasure_fleet_lover.GetBestName] and I spent a very enjoyable night together in my cabin. As [From.GetSheHe] started getting dressed in the early hours of the morning I had some time to consider whether this might be the start of something lasting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8879;We should do this again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8879;I don't think we'll do it again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8880;As I was getting dressed after a very enjoyable night in [From.GetBestName]'s cabin [From.GetSheHe] kissed me and told me that [From.GetSheHe] hopes that we will be able to spend many more nights in each other's company in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8880;I look forward to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8881;As I was getting dressed after a very enjoyable night in [From.GetBestName]'s cabin [From.GetSheHe] told me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks we should not make a habit out of it, especially considering that the Treasure Fleet is departing soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8881;Perhaps that's for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8882;Today I came across a local wearing an unfamiliar sword. The man was quite willing to let me inspect the weapon when I told him I am a duelist of some renown, and after I had handed it back he asked me if I wanted to spar with him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8882;Certainly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8882;As if I would lower myself to that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8883;The man's fighting style is unfamiliar to me, and he is certainly someone who knows how to wield a sword, but eventually he makes a mistake that allows me to gain the upper hand. He gives me a deep bow and proclaims himself defeated once I have disarmed him, then he sheathes his sword and departs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8883;Not too difficult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8884;The man's fighting style is unfamiliar to me, and he is certainly someone who knows how to wield a sword. We go at it for quite some time, neither of us managing to get the upper hand, and eventually have to call it a draw.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8884;Well fought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8885;The man's fighting style is unfamiliar to me, and he is certainly someone who knows how to wield a sword. I find myself unable to defend myself, and take a wound as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8885;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8886;As I entered a tavern in the port the Treasure Fleet currently is visiting I spotted some locals playing an unfamiliar board game. Noticing my interest, one of them asked me whether I wanted to join them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8886;Just tell me the rules!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8886;I have other things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8887;The rules for the board game are explained to me in brief, and after playing a practice game I feel confident enough to make a wager on the next game. It goes quite well, as I apparently approach things in an unorthodox way that still is within the rules.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8887;So simple!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8888;The rules for the board game are explained to me in brief, and after playing a practice game I feel confident enough to make a wager on the next game. It goes quite poorly, seeing as my unorthodox approach is more chaotic than it is effective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8888;It seems I have lost...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8889;Today I chanced upon some locals that were trying to make sense of a board game they apparently had purchased from a sailor from the Treasure Fleet. Upon noticing me they asked if I could go over the rules with them as they seemed unsure about them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8889;Certainly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8889;I have other things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8890;I go over the rules with the locals and play a practice game against one of them. My opponent feels confident enough to make a wager on the next game, which I accept. Her unorthodox approach is slightly confusing, but it is not effective against me, and she is eventually forced to concede.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8890;Child's play!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8891;I go over the rules with the locals and play a practice game against one of them. My opponent feels confident enough to make a wager on the next game, which I accept. Her unorthodox approach to the game catches me off guard, and eventually it is clear that I have lost the game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8891;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8892;Though I have not yet seen the need for it I have concluded that it would be a good idea to inspect the fortifications and to discreetly inquire about the local garrisons near where the Treasure Fleet currently is located, should we be required to take military action. Several officers aboard the ships have seen fit to assist me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8892;It's just a contingency...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8894;The locals have been quite interested in learning about the Middle Kingdom and its history, and I have done my best to satisfy their curiosity. Most of them have expressed surprise at how well read I am, as I have rarely needed to consult my books before providing an answer to their questions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8894;I know a lot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8895;Though many foreigners have little to offer the Middle Kingdom I have taken the opportunity to learn what I can while abroad, and lately I have picked up several useful pieces of knowledge that seem rather obvious in hindsight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8895;This knowledge will serve me well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8896;When I returned to the docks after spending the day ashore I was approached by several dockworkers that wanted to ask me if I wanted to share a drink with them and some sailors from the Treasure Fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8896;A drink? Sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8896;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8897;The drink the dockworkers provided me had a vile taste unlike anything I had tasted before. I did my best to keep it down, but it quickly became apparent that that was not going to work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8897;Out of my way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8898;The drink the dockworkers gave to me was quite strong, and I had some trouble walking back to my cabin. The headache the next morning was also quite unpleasant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8898;That... was a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8899;The rest of the evening passes in a blur, and when I leave my cabin in the morning I notice that many of those aboard the my ship are trying not to laugh when they see me. I later learn that I apparently saw fit to strip naked to "Show the true splendour of the Middle Kingdom!" after drinking with the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8899;I did what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8900;The drink the dockworkers give me is not terribly impressive, but I have had worse. I thank them after finishing it and politely decline the offer of a second drink, then head aboard the ship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8900;I suppose that was okay...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8901;I usually drink in moderation back in [Root.Capital.GetName], but I have found myself drinking more often during the Treasure Fleet's voyage, and I find myself rather enjoying the experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8901;I should drink more often!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8902;One drink quickly turns into several drinks, and before long several of the sailors and dockworkers make excuses to leave, many of them walking unsteadily. Those that remain leave one by one, until finally I am the last one present.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8902;But we only had ten drinks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8903;The drink I am given by the dockworkers is quite nice, as is the company. I really should make a habit of trying new drinks whenever possible, no matter who is offering them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8903;Another round? Sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8904;Several of the locals seem to find me far more interesting to look at than many of the others from the Treasure Fleet, even if they also seem to want to avoid me for the most part. I ask a child about it one day, and they tell me that most people are not interested in spending time with a crazy foreigner, even one as strange as me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8904;Well, I did ask...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8905;The people of [native_province.GetName] are so interesting. Being a [Root.Culture.GetName] [Root.Religion.GetName] is rather boring in comparison. Perhaps I should become a [native_province.Culture.GetName] [native_province.Religion.GetName], like the locals?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8905;It is time for a new me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8905;That sounds insane... even for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8906;The Treasure Fleet will be departing before long, and there are still so many local sights to behold. I have been trying to see everything of note, but there simply is not enough time for everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8906;I need to do as much as possible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8907;Several of the locals have expressed an interest in Chinese medicine as it apparently is seen as very fashionable in this part of the world. It seems they are looking for a teacher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8907;I'll share what I know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8908;Some of the locals have apparently overhead that I know quite a bit about medicine and have taken the opportunity to request my assistance with tending to some people that were injured in a recent accident near the docks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8908;An easy day's work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8909;As I am returning to my ship late one evening a local [sex_partner.GetManWoman] approaches me and rather bluntly tells me that [sex_partner.GetSheHe] likes the way I look and that [sex_partner.GetSheHe] would like to spend a night with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8909;How about more than one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8909;One night? Sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_8909;Absolutely not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8910;The [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven expects me and everyone else aboard the Treasure Fleet to represent the Middle Kingdom abroad and to make a good impression, seeing as the foreign barbarians cannot be allowed to think that the Dragon Throne is uncultured, uncivilized, or otherwise uncouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8910;I need to look my best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8911;Today I had the opportunity to talk to some notable individuals in one of the ports that the Treasure Fleet is visiting in the area. They asked me if it was true that the Treasure Fleet had come to share the Middle Kingdom's prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8911;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8911;We do wish to "share our prosperity", yes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8912;I have always been told that everyone outside the borders of the Middle Kingdom are savages and barbarians worthy of nothing but contempt, but the more time I spend abroad the more I come to realize that that is perhaps not true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8912;We should not judge them too hastily!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8913;I have tried keeping an open mind when visiting various foreign ports as a representative of the Dragon Throne, but it is becoming clear to me that the locals have no respect for civilized behaviour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8913;Barbarians, the lot of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8914;Today I was offered the opportunity to sample some of the local delicacies in the port the Treasure Fleet currently is visiting. They were not half bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8914;I want more of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8915;Today I was offered the opportunity to sample some of the local delicacies in the port the Treasure Fleet currently is visiting. They were not half bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8915;How much did I eat?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8916;Most of the others travelling about the same ship as me have already headed ashore, but I have remained behind so far. There is a lot of people waiting just off the ship, and meeting them sounds potentially exhausting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8916;Maybe I should just stay here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8916;Maybe I could use some time off the ship...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8917;Many aboard the Treasure Fleet look down on the locals in the ports we visit and see nothing of value, but the more time I spend abroad the more I realize that they have all kinds of things that are unheard of in the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8917;I envy them so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8918;Though several of the others travelling aboard my ship are content to think that they do not need to consider local laws this far from the Middle Kingdom I have taken the opportunity to read up on them to make sure I do not break them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8918;We should not give them cause to arrest us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8919;Today some of the local guards got upset with me because I apparently had broken some minor local law. They told me that they would let me get off with a warning, this once, as I am a representative of the Dragon Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8919;Who cares about your silly laws!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8920;Today some minor noble[Root.GetMenWomen] approached me when I came ashore and asked me if I could put in a good word with the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven for them. They paid quite handsomely for my assistance, and all of them failed to notice that I did not care to write down their names.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8920;Such gullible fools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8921;Today I spotted some suspicious individuals in the marketplace shortly after I came ashore. I spent the rest of the day moving from one location to another, making sure that I was not followed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8921;They're after me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8922;There have been times in the past when I have been convinced that danger lurks in every shadow, but the last few times I have headed ashore I have not felt that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8922;I feel safe here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8923;I have tried to keep an open mind when the Treasure Fleet has made landfall, knowing that not everyone follows the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, but as time goes on I find it more and more difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8923;Their ways are wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8924;Some of the locals approached me today after I finished up my midday prayers and asked me about my faith. They were quite surprised to learn that I am a Faqih, and asked me to recite some Qur'an verses I find particularly inspirational. I did as requested, and several of the locals said that they liked what they heard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8924;I am glad to hear that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8925;When spending time away from the ship I came across [local_child.GetBestName]. [local_child.GetSheHeCap] and I spent the day together, both talking and exploring the city, and [local_child.GetSheHe] seems quite nice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8925;And [local_child.GetSheHe] is very pretty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8925;It was a nice day, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8926;I met [From.GetBestName] today when [From.GetSheHe] came ashore from the Treasure Fleet to explore the city, and we spent the day together. [From.GetSheHeCap] and I had fun today, and it seems like [From.GetSheHe] really likes me, probably not just as a friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8926;[From.GetSheHeCap] is very pretty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8926;I don't feel that way about [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_8926;A [From.GetBoyGirl] likes me? Gross!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8927;Today I met [local_child.GetBestName] when exploring the city. [local_child.GetSheHeCap] and I had a lot of fun together, despite our rather different backgrounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8927;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8927;I'm not interested...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8928;Today I met [From.GetBestName] when exploring the city. [From.GetSheHeCap] and I had a lot of fun together, despite our rather different backgrounds, and [From.GetSheHe] has suggested that we should become friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8928;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8928;I'm not interested...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8929;It seems [local_child.GetBestName] also enjoyed spending time with me, seeing as [local_child.GetSheHe] was quite happy when I suggested that we should be friends. I hope we will have the opportunity to meet again soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8929;Best friends forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8930;It seems [local_child.GetBestName] is not interested in being my friend. [local_child.GetSheHeCap] claims [local_child.GetSheHe] had fun today but that it really would not work once the Treasure Fleet leaves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8930;Fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8931;Today I met [local_child.GetBestName] when exploring the local port. We spent the day together, which seemed like a good idea even though it was not particularly fun or eventful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8931;It was okay...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8932;Today I met [From.GetBestName] when [From.GetSheHe] came ashore to explore the local port. We spent the day together, which seemed like a good idea even though it was not particularly fun or eventful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8932;It was okay...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8933;I met [local_child.GetBestName] shortly after coming ashore today, and [local_child.GetSheHe] wasted no time getting on my nerves with [local_child.GetHerHis] commanding attitude. I tried to be friendly, but [local_child.GetSheHe] really seemed to be out to get me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8933;I hate you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8934;I met [From.GetBestName] after [From.GetSheHe] came ashore today, and though I tried to be friendly and to show [From.GetHerHim] the shights [From.GetSheHe] did not appreciate my company. [From.GetSheHeCap] was really unpleasant, and by the time we parted ways [From.GetSheHe] said that [From.GetSheHe] hates me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8934;Not as much as I hate you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8935;I spent the day exploring the local port and trying to learn more about its people, its customs, and its history. Many of the locals were quite surprised to see a child come ashore from the Treasure Fleet, and were kind enough to answer many of my questions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8935;I learned something today!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8936;I spent the day exploring the local port and trying to learn more about its people, its customs, and its history. Many of the locals were quite surprised to see a child come ashore from the Treasure Fleet, and were kind enough to answer many of my questions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8936;I learned something today!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8937;I spent the day exploring the local port and trying to learn more about its people, its customs, and its history. Many of the locals were quite surprised to see a child come ashore from the Treasure Fleet, and were kind enough to answer many of my questions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8937;I learned something today!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8938;I spent the day exploring the local port and trying to learn more about its people, its customs, and its history. Many of the locals were quite surprised to see a child come ashore from the Treasure Fleet, and were kind enough to answer many of my questions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8938;I learned something today!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8939;I spent the day exploring the local port and trying to learn more about its people, its customs, and its history. Many of the locals were quite surprised to see a child come ashore from the Treasure Fleet, and were kind enough to answer many of my questions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8939;I learned something today!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8940;The locals in the ports the Treasure Fleet has visited lately seem to think that I am particularly keen to show how kind I am as a person, possibly because I have gotten along well with some local children. They seem to approve of this quite a bit, which I think is quite nice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8940;It just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8941;The locals in the ports the Treasure Fleet has visited lately seem to think that I am very interested in playing games and generally having fun, no matter the situation. At least some of them seem to approve, which is fine by me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8941;It just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8942;The locals in the ports the Treasure Fleet has visited lately seem to think that I am rather vain. I have heard some of them say that I seem to look down on them more than many others from the Treasure Fleet, which may or may not be the case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8942;It just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8943;The locals in the ports the Treasure Fleet has visited lately seem to think that I am rather rowdy in general, possibly because I have gotten into fights with some local children. They do not seem to approve very much, but I do not particularly care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8943;It just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8944;The locals in the ports the Treasure Fleet has visited lately seem to think that I am a particularly responsible and orderly child. They seem to approve of this quite a bit, as do many from the Treasure Fleet, so I am probably doing something right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8944;It just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8945;The locals in the ports the Treasure Fleet has visited lately seem to think that I am somewhat bothersome due to insisting that things should be a certain way. They do not seem to approve, but I am not doing anything wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8945;It just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8946;The locals in the ports the Treasure Fleet has visited lately seem to think that I am rather quiet and that I frequently seem lost in my thoughts. Judging by the looks they give me, they do not always approve, but I see no reason to change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8946;It just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8947;The locals in the ports the Treasure Fleet has visited lately seem to think that I am particularly keen to avoid exhausting myself. Quite a few of them seem concerned by this, but I am not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8947;It just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8948;The locals in the ports the Treasure Fleet has visited lately seem to think that I am particularly keen to disobey the officials that try to tell me what to do. Few of them seem to approve, but I still will not do things just because I am told to do them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8948;It just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8949;The locals in the ports the Treasure Fleet has visited lately seem to think that I have a great deal of curiosity, possibly because I ask a lot of questions and take time to explore as much as possible. A great many of them seem to think that this is a good thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8949;It just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8950;The locals in the ports the Treasure Fleet has visited lately seem to think that I am very interested in seeking the truth and sticking to it. Some of them seem worried that this might not be a good thing, but I think they are wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8950;It just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8951;The locals in the ports the Treasure Fleet has visited lately seem to think that I am very reserved and cautious child. I have heard some of them say that this is worrying, but I feel differently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8951;It just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8952;I have had a lot of fun playing with the children I have encountered whenever the Treasure Fleet has stopped in a foreign port, and they seem to have had fun with me too. Several of them have said that I am one of the kindest individuals they have ever met.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8952;You should always be kind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8953;Some of the children I have encountered in the ports I have visited have seemed reluctant to play with me at first, but they have gotten over it once they have realized that I do not hold myself in as high a regard as some people from the Treasure Fleet hold themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8953;I am not better than others!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8954;Today when I was returning to my ship from one of the markets in the port I was visiting I saw that some of the local children seemed to be awed by the many toys I had purchased for myself. I asked them if they wanted some of them, and they happily took a few each.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8954;Sharing is caring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8955;I had a lot of fun with [local_child.GetBestName] when visiting [local_child.GetHerHis] home during the Treasure Fleet's visit to the port nearby. I look forward to meeting [local_child.GetHerHim] again, as we have become good friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8955;Best friends forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8956;I have always enjoyed playing with other children, and I have realized that it gets even more fun when you play tricks on people. Not everyone seems to appreciate it, but I do not really care about that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8956;Tricking people is fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8957;I enjoy meeting other children and playing with them, and though many of those I have encountered in foreign ports have been a bit reluctant to play with a stranger at first I have usually found myself able to convince them to let me join.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8957;You just need to know what to say!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8958;Today I made a local girl cry when we were playing. Apparently she thought I was mean and played far too roughly, but it was all within the rules of the game we were playing, and I had fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8958;You choose to play with me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8959;The children I have been playing with in the port my ship is docked in at the moment have convinced me that we should be trying to see if we can take some money from the merchants in the marketplace. It is a funny game, as long as we do not get caught.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8959;And we got some money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8960;Many of the local children have showed an interest in playing with me when I have headed ashore from my ship, but quite a few of them have become less interested once we have started playing. They seem to think that I am disrespectful because I acknowledge one very important truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8960;The truth is that I am better than them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8961;The game I was playing with some children in a local port ended with me having to beat up a boy because he seemingly thought that he was the one in charge, which does not respect me or the proper order of things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8961;Look what you made me do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8962;Today some of the officials from the Treasure Fleet had to tell the guards in a local port to let me return to the ships after they had gotten upset with me when I entered a building they did not want me to enter. The guards seemed to think that I should have to follow the rules they have in this strange foreign land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8962;As if such rules apply to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8963;I have started to notice that some people are quite beautiful in ways I did not when I was younger. I think I want them to pay more attention to me, and if that is to be the case then I must make sure that I look as good as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8963;Looks matter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8964;Today the guards of a supposedly important local grabbed me when I was walking about in the port that the Treasure Fleet was visiting and brought me before their mistress. She told me I had acted disrespectfully towards her and ordered the guards to give me a beating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8964;How dare you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8965;A number of the officials aboard the Treasure Fleet have told me that I should make sure not to neglect my studies just because the Treasure Fleet has made landfall, but I think that they just hate fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8965;I don't need books!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8966;Several of the officials from the Treasure Fleet have told me that I should be careful when I head ashore, seeing as there could be many dangers in a foreign port. I think they worry too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8966;I laugh in the face danger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8967;As I was returning to the Treasure Fleet today I came across some local children that clearly were looking for a fight. Luckily for them, so was I.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8967;Show me what you've got!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8968;Today when I was spending some time in the market near the docks of the port that my ship was visiting one of the merchants offered me some sweets for free. He seemed quite surprised when I turned him down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8968;Sweets are bad for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8969;Some of the local guards praised me today after I told them that I saw some other children sneaking around near some of the market stalls. Apparently I stopped them from stealing some money from the merchants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8969;I knew rules were important!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8970;Today one of the officials aboard my ship told me that he had been asked to tell me that many of the locals apparently have felt that I set a good example for other children by always doing what I am asked when ashore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8970;I'm only doing what's right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8971;I have always made sure that things are as they should be before I get started, and this has resulted in me needing some time to get ready before heading ashore from my ship. Some of the officials think I might be missing out on seeing some of the local sights, but I am sure I am doing the right thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8971;If it takes time, it takes time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8972;Today some local children got annoyed with me when I was packing the pieces of the game we had been playing. Apparently they thought that I should just put them all away as quickly as possible, as opposed to sorting them properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8972;It has to be done properly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8973;I tried to play with some of the local children after heading ashore today. At first it went well, but then they decided to leave after I insisted that they were not playing the games properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8973;They were doing it wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8974;Some of the officials aboard the Treasure Fleet have been concerned about me choosing to remain on the ship several times when we have reached a local port. They think that I might have more fun ashore, meeting other children my age, than I can have reading books aboard the ship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8974;A good book is never bad company!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8975;I have noticed that several of the children ashore have very interesting toys, and that those anywhere close to my own standing have quite a few of them. I have tried to ask if I could have some of them, but they have refused to share.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8975;I want what they have!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8976;I have tried to spend some time with local children when the Treasure Fleet has made landfall in the past, but I have come to realize that that is rather exhausting and not worth my time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8976;I prefer to be alone...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8977;I was watching some of the local children playing today, content to observe what was going on, when one of the girls noticed me. She asked if I wanted to play, but I said that I did not, which she seemed to take as me feeling that I am better than them. She seemed offended by that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SOH_8977;And?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8978;Some of the officials aboard my ship have suggested that I should head ashore more when the Treasure Fleet docks somewhere. They seem to think that I might be missing out, and that I should do more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8978;I'd rather do as little as possible...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8979:I have come to realize that the best way to avoid doing things I would rather not do is to come up with a good reason not to and to present it in a good way. The adults aboard my ship seem to find it convincing, at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8979;I'm sure that will keep working!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8980;Several of the officials from the Treasure Fleet have suggested that I should try to follow the rules they try to set for me when I head ashore, convinced that it might be dangerous for me to always do what I want rather than what they tell me to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8980;I'm not scared!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8981;As the Treasure Fleet keeps on visiting more and more foreign ports I grow less and less satisfied with what I have back in [Root.Capital.GetName], even though some might say that that is more than sufficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8981;I want more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8982;When playing with the local children in the ports the Treasure Fleet has visited I have tried to play according to their rules, but they feel quite wrong, and not at all like how I want to do things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8982;My way is the best way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8983;I had fun playing with some of the local children in the port my ship was visiting today. They seemed to be looking up to me quite a bit, and when someone needed to make a decision they put me in charge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8983;An obvious choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8984;Some of the officials from my ship have told me that I should follow the rules they make and make sure that I have read the books they have told me to read before heading ashore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8984;But I don't want to!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8985;The foreign ports that the Treasure Fleet have visited have all been quite interesting. As always, I have tried to learn what I can about the locals and their history and customs, which might benefit me one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8985;Knowledge is power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8986;I have come into contact with many foreigners when visiting different ports during the Treasure Fleet's voyage. Their ways have seemed strange at times, but they are not necessarily wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8986;Such interesting customs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8987;It took me quite a lot of time to see all of the sights in the last port the Treasure Fleet visited, and many of the adults that accompanied me decided to head back before we were done. They missed out on so many things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8987;It was worth continuing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8988;I spotted a ruined tower near the waterfront before heading ashore today and decided to explore it. As I was climbing a half-collapsed stairway near the top of the tower I felt the stones beneath my feet move unexpectedly, and I could not move out of the way before I fell down a hole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8985;This will hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8989;I spent the day ashore, talking with any locals that were open to speaking to a child and asking them all about the area, its history, and assorted other things. Some of them were reluctant to talk to a child for long, but quite a few were willing to answer my questions, and I learned many new things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8989;Fascinating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8990;I spent the day ashore, talking with any locals that were open to speaking to a child and asking them all about the area, its history, and assorted other things. Some of them were reluctant to talk to a child for long, but quite a few were willing to answer my questions, and I learned many new things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8990;Fascinating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8991;I spent the day ashore, talking with any locals that were open to speaking to a child and asking them all about the area, its history, and assorted other things. Some of them were reluctant to talk to a child for long, but quite a few were willing to answer my questions, and I learned many new things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8991;Fascinating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8992;I spent the day ashore, talking with any locals that were open to speaking to a child and asking them all about the area, its history, and assorted other things. Some of them were reluctant to talk to a child for long, but quite a few were willing to answer my questions, and I learned many new things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8992;Fascinating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8993;I spent the day ashore, talking with any locals that were open to speaking to a child and asking them all about the area, its history, and assorted other things. Some of them were reluctant to talk to a child for long, but quite a few were willing to answer my questions, and I learned many new things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8993;Fascinating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8994;Today I visited the local market to buy as many new books as I could, as has become my custom whenever the Treasure Fleet makes landfall. The merchants seemed quite surprised that a child would be so interested in reading.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8994;Books hold many answers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8995;I have spent the journey aboard the Treasure Fleet looking for answers, and as time has gone by I have come to realize that the [Root.TrueReligion.GetName] faith has them all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8995;It is the truth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8996;I was playing with some local children today when one of them suggested that we should explore an abandoned warehouse near the waterfront, apparently thinking that there might be something interesting inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8996;That sounds too scary for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8997;Some of the officials aboard the Treasure Fleet have suggested that I should spend more time ashore as I might have the opportunity to play with other children my age. They think that that would be good for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8997;But I don't want to meet new people...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8998;Some of the local children were reluctant to play with me at first as they apparently thought that everyone from the Treasure Fleet was stuffy and looked down on them. When I showed them that I did not, they accepted me as one of their own, and we had a lot of fun together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8998;I am no better than them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8999;I have noticed that some of those aboard the Treasure Fleet always seem to want more, but the longer our journey goes on the more I have come to realize that that is not the case for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8999;I have all I need!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
