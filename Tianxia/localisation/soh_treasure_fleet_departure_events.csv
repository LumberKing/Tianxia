EVTTITLE_SOH_9103;Far from the Dragon's Eyes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9103;The Treasure Fleet is quite far from the Middle Kingdom, and thus far from the Dragon Throne. Recently, several of the commanders in charge of the soldiers that are accompanying the Treasure Fleet have obliquely suggested that perhaps I should seize this opportunity and carve out a realm of my own in the lands currently held by [potential_treasure_fleet_invasion_target.GetBestName].\nShould I attempt to do this, [From.treasure_fleet_army_strength.GetValue] regiments, each with a thousand soldiers, will pledge themselves to my cause, provided I can put my plan into motion. Failure would likely result in the Dragon Throne making an example of me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9103;This is my destiny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9103;That would be treason...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9105;At my signal the commanders that have pledged themselves to me order their forces into motion. However, though the element of surprise is on our side, the loyalists soon strike back, and we are eventually overcome. I find myself chained up on a ship bound back to China, awaiting the Dragon Throne's mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9105;This is all a misunderstanding!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9106;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] attempted to seize control of the forces accompanying the Treasure Fleet in order to carve out an empire of [From.GetHerHis] own. Luckily, the loyal elements of the Treasure Fleet managed to put an end to this treasonous plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9106;I will deal with this traitor myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9107;As the Treasure Fleet is about to depart forces loyal to [From.GetBestName] attempt to take control of the fleet, proclaiming that [From.GetBestName] will forge an empire to last ten thousand years. However, [From.GetHerHis] rebellion does not even last a day, and [From.GetSheHe] is captured and shipped back to the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9107;I doubt the Dragon Throne will be merciful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9108;I have received word that [From.GetBestName] sought to use the Treasure Fleet to carve out an empire of [From.GetHerHis] own but that the attempt was unsuccessful. The traitor has been shipped back to the Middle Kingdom to stand trial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9108;How unexpected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9109;The commanders who have pledged themselves to me strike on my signal, and with the element of surprise on our side we seize control of most of the ships belonging to the Treasure Fleet. A few vessels make their escape as my forces make landfall, but they are in no position to stop me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9109;Onwards to victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9110;I have just received word that the traitorous [From.GetBestName] has suborned the Treasure Fleet and that [From.GetSheHe] now seeks to carve out an empire of [From.GetHerHis] own. Should [From.GetHerHis] initial conquest succeed, [From.GetSheHe] will likely claim the Mandate of Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9110;Traitor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9111;As the Treasure Fleet is about to depart on its voyage fighting breaks out briefly aboard nearly all of the ships. It seems [From.GetBestName] has managed to gain the loyalty of the soldiers assigned to the fleet, and now seeks to carve out an empire of [From.GetHerHis] own. I am among those lucky enough to escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9111;We will have to return home as best we can...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9112;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName] has seized control of the Treasure Fleet and that [From.GetSheHe] intends to use it to carve out an emprie of [From.GetHerHis] own. This doubtlessly displeases the Dragon Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x0
EVTOPTA_SOH_9112;Interesting times...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9114;As the Treasure Fleet is about to depart from Java a minor official tentatively suggests that perhaps the fleet should sail further east instead of returning to the Middle Kingdom, since there might be something of interest in that direction. The matter is eventually put to a vote, and my input is required.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9114;We should head back to China!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9114;THE STARS ARE ALMOST RIGHT!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9114;Qin Shi Huangdi sent an expedition to the east...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_9114;There are rumours of a great queen to the east...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_9114;Perhaps we might reach a mysterious land...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_9114;I have heard of a lost continent...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_SOH_9114;Some speak of a king living east of east...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTH_SOH_9114;I once heard a tale of a strange silence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTI_SOH_9114;There might be interesting things to the east...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9116;The voting takes quite some time as there are many officials in the Treasure Fleet that are being given the opportunity to take part. However, after a while the final vote is cast, and once the counting is done it is clear that the majority desires for the Treasure Fleet to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9116;We head home, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9117;The voting takes quite some time as there are many officials in the Treasure Fleet that are being given the opportunity to take part. However, after a while the final vote is cast, and once the counting is done it is clear that the majority desires for the Treasure Fleet to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9117;Perhaps I should join it on the homeward voyage...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9118;I have received word that though some aboard the Treasure Fleet wished to sail further east from Java the decision has been made to return to the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9118;Rather unsurprising, that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9119;I have received word that though some aboard the Treasure Fleet wished to sail further east from Java the decision has been made to return to the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9119;Rather unsurprising, that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9120;The voting takes quite some time as there are many officials in the Treasure Fleet that are being given the opportunity to take part. However, after a while the final vote is cast, and once the counting is done it is clear that the majority desires for the Treasure Fleet to continue further east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9120;Into the unknown!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9120;Actually, I think I want to head home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9121;The voting takes quite some time as there are many officials in the Treasure Fleet that are being given the opportunity to take part. However, after a while the final vote is cast, and once the counting is done it is clear that the majority desires for the Treasure Fleet to continue further east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9121;I think I will be going with it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9121;Time for me to depart, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9122;I have received word that the Treasure Fleet will attempt to sail into the unknown east beyond Java. Apparently the officials aboard think that the region should be investigated in the name of the Dragon Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9122;I wonder what they will find...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9123;I have received word that the Treasure Fleet will attempt to sail into the unknown east beyond Java. Apparently the officials aboard think that the region should be investigated in the name of the Dragon Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9123;I wonder what they will find...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9125;The Treasure Fleet's supplies are not without limits, and though there might still be ports of interest elsewhere it will be sailing back towards the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9125;It is time for us to return!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9126;The Treasure Fleet's supplies are not without limits, and though there might still be ports of interest elsewhere it will be sailing back towards the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9126;We should return together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9126;I will make my own path home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9127;It seems the reach of the Dragon Throne has its limits, seeing as the admiral in charge of the Treasure Fleet has announced that it will be sailing back to the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9127;I wonder if it will return...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9128;I have received word that the Treasure Fleet is making its way home. No doubt those aboard it will have tales to tell when they return to the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9128;I eagerly await their return!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9130;The Treasure Fleet is still able to continue further away from the Middle Kingdom, and as such the command has been given for the voyage to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9130;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9131;The Treasure Fleet is still able to continue further away from the Middle Kingdom, and as such the command has been given for the voyage to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9131;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9131;I will be heading home now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9132;I have received word that the Treasure Fleet will continue further away from the Middle Kingdom, seeing as it still has plenty of supplies and is no worse for wear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9132;Perhaps it will return later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9133;I have been informed that the Treasure Fleet will be continuing further away from the Middle Kingdom, proving once and for all that the Dragon Throne's reach is longer than many would suspect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9133;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9134;It seems that I have been infected with some kind of illness when the Treasure Fleet was in port.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9134;I feel unwell...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9136;It seems [From.GetBestName] was a bit late when returning to the Treasure Fleet and that it left them behind as a result. They are now asking for my help to return to the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9136;I will help them get back home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9136;They should stay here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9136;I have a place for them... in the dungeon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_9136;And they were never seen again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
