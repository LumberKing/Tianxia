EVTDESC_SOH_9203;The archipelago east of Java and the immediately adjacent islands is home to various primitive tribes that should pose no threat to the Middle Kingdom. Unfortunately, they are still somewhat dangerous to the Treasure Fleet, and now they have seen fit to attack the fleet, catching the inattentive guards by surprise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9203;Prepare for battle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9203;Hide!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9204;Though the initial ferocity of the islanders that attacked the Treasure Fleet was surprising, it did not prove to be sufficient for them to win the day. I and the soldiers aboard rally together, and once we start fighting back in earnest it is only a matter of time before the attackers are slain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9204;Pests taken care of!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9205;Though the initial ferocity of the islanders that attacked the Treasure Fleet was surprising, it did not prove to be sufficient for them to win the day. Several people are wounded before we manage to drive them off, including me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9205;They fought well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9206;Though the initial ferocity of the islanders that attacked the Treasure Fleet was surprising, it did not prove to be sufficient for them to win the day. We prevail in the end, but I take a grievous wound in the fighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9206;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9207;The islanders fight fiercely, and though I and the other defenders on my ship put up a fierce fight we are not strong enough to drive them back. A spear slip past my defenses, and then another, and then another. Before long, I collapse to the deck, bleeding out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9207;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9208;Though the initial ferocity of the islanders that attacked the Treasure Fleet was surprising, it did not prove to be sufficient for them to win the day. The defenders rally and drive them off without any casualties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9208;Phew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9209;Though the initial ferocity of the islanders that attacked the Treasure Fleet was surprising, it did not prove to be sufficient for them to win the day. I am injured by one of the attackers despite attempting to hide, but the wound is relatively mild, and the attackers have been driven off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9209;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9210;Though the initial ferocity of the islanders that attacked the Treasure Fleet was surprising, it did not prove to be sufficient for them to win the day. While the defenders prevail in the end some of the attackers find me and the others that have attempted to hide from the fighting, and I take a grievous wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9210;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9211;The islanders fight fiercely, and though the defenders fight bravely they are overcome. I attempt to run towards the railing in order to swim towards another ship, but the savages strike me down before I can move very far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9211;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9212;Though the archipelago east of Java is said to be inhabited by a large number of tribes we have so far not encountered any signs of life. As the Treasure Fleet is somewhat dispersed, it is possible that other ships have had more luck, but it almost seems as if the locals intentionally are avoiding us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9212;What are they afraid of?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9213;One day several small ships come rowing out from one of the islands, heading straight for my ship. One of the islanders requests permission to come aboard, and once aboard he extends an invitation from the chief of his tribe, who apparently wishes to hold a feast for some people from the Treasure Fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9213;Certainly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9213;I'll pass!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9215;The feast the islanders are holding for the Treasure Fleet is surprisingly good, and the food in particular is to my liking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9215;Bring me some more of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9216;The feast the islanders are holding for the Treasure Fleet is surprisingly good, and they offer a large variety of food and drinks. Though the food is somewhat less good than I had hoped for, the drinks are quite good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9216;Another drink? Sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9217;Though the islanders appear to have put in as much of an effort as they possibly could to ensure that I and the others from the Treasure Fleet would have a good time, it quickly becomes clear that they have no idea how to treat such august guests. I am forced to conclude that they are nothing but savages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9217;Barely even human...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9218;The islanders turn out to be a bit more intriguing than I initially expected, and several of them turn out to be quite attractive. One young [attractive_islander.GetManWoman], [attractive_islander.GetBestName], notices that I seem to like what I am seeing, and suggests that the two of us should find someplace private.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9218;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9218;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9219;Though the islanders at the feast are unlikely to know anything about the Art of War it is quite possible that their style of personal combat is unlike anything found elsewhere. Some of the warriors offer to show me a few things when I start asking questions, which might be an opportunity to learn new fighting skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9219;Show me what you've got!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9219;I'd rather just enjoy the feast...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9220;I and some of the warriors from the village head off a short distance away from the festivities. They lend me a few of their weapons and show me how to make the most use of them. Though I have some difficulty at first they are good teachers, and when the lesson is over I have picked up a few tricks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9220;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9221;I and some of the warriors from the village head off a short distance away from the festivities. They lend me a few of their weapons and show me how to make the most use of them. Sadly, they do not turn out to be good teachers, and one of their attempts to demonstrate their techniques results in me being injured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9221;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9222;The islanders at the feast are quite interested in learning more about me and the Middle Kingdom, and though some of them lose interest after the first few answers I give them some of them others wish to learn even more. By the end of feast one of them, [new_islander.GetBestName], asks to come with me, promising to serve me faithfully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9222;I accept your oath!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9222;I have no need for a savage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9223;Though many would be eager to dismiss the islanders at the feast as primitives they turn out to be quite knowledge. They might perhaps not know as much as the average person in the Middle Kingdom, but some of the things I overhear at the feast still seem surprisingly applicable for me and my subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9223;Perhaps these primitives are not so primitive...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9224;I have a good time at the feast that the islanders have arranged forthe Treasure Fleet, and it turns out that they have enjoyed my presence as well as they offer me a gift that consists of a fairly large amount of gold they apparently recovered off of a shipwreck some time in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9224;Gold? Sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9224;I cannot possibly accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9225;One day several small ships come rowing out from one of the islands, heading straight for my ship. One of the islanders requests permission to come aboard, and once aboard he extends an invitation from the chief of his tribe, who apparently wishes to hold a feast for some people from the Treasure Fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9225;Certainly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9225;I'll pass!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9227;As I and the other officials wait for the food to be prepared at the feast the islanders are arranging several of the soldiers accompanying us start getting "lost" in the jungle. Noting the smiles, red and white, on the faces of the islanders, I am quick to realize what is going on, and I really start looking forward to the food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9227;I do so enjoy a proper meal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9228;As I and the other officials wait for the food to be prepared at the feast the islanders are arranging several of the soldiers accompanying us start getting "lost" in the jungle. The islanders are all smiling, red and white, and as I look down into the cauldrons hanging over the fires I realize just what kind of meat is being offered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9228;If I eat, they might spare me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9228;I'll make a run for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9229;I take off at a run, calling out to the others from the Treasure Fleet to flee from the cannibals as well. The islanders are taken by surprise by this, and it takes some time before they are able to give chase. Though a few more soldiers fall, I manage to return to the Treasure Fleet in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9229;Phew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9230;I take off at a run, calling out to the others from the Treasure Fleet to flee from the cannibals as well. The islanders are quick to give chase, and though the soldiers we have with us valiantly hold the line to buy me and the rest time to escape some of the islanders get past them, and I have been injured by the time I escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9230;At least I am alive...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9231;I take off at a run, calling out to the others from the Treasure Fleet to flee from the cannibals as well. The islanders seem to have been expecting this, as they are quick to give chase, and though we try to get away from them we get lost in the jungle and find ourselves surrounded by cannibals on all sides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9231;No! No! No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9232;I and the others from the Treasure Fleet are led to a village containing a lot more islanders than you were expecting. All of them appear to be armed, even down to children barely old enough to walk, and it quickly becomes clear why when our guide proclaims that the feast can begin now that the main course has arrived.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9232;You'll never catch us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9233;I and the others from the Treasure Fleet succeed in fighting our way out of the village, and though many of the soldiers with us fall to buy the rest of us time to get away the majority of those with me manage to get away without injuries. We hurry back to the Treasure Fleet and order the ships in the area to depart at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9233;Phew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9234;I and the others from the Treasure Fleet succeed in fighting our way out of the village. Many soldiers fall in the attempt, and I and many others are injured by the islanders as they give chase. Eventually we manage to make our way back to the Treasure Fleet and order the ships in the area to depart at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9234;That could have gone a lot worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9235;I and the others from the Treasure Fleet attempt to fight our way out of the village, and though many fall during the attempt we escape into the jungle. However, without a guide we quickly lose our way, and instead of making it back to the Treasure Fleet we somehow end up back at the village, surrounded by cannibals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9235;No! Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9236;As the Treasure Fleet continues further east through the archipelago I and several other officials attempt to establish contact with the islanders. Most of them avoid the fleet, but a few are willing to talk to us, and when they learn that we plan to head further east they urge us to turn back, as no ship has ever returned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9236;"No ships return...?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9237;Though the islanders of the archipelago east of Java only have very small vessels to use when traversing the seas in the area they turn out to have fairly detailed star maps for navigational use. Noting my interest, one of them offers to sell me a map for a relatively modest amount of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9237;I'll purchase it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9237;Keep it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9238;The islanders living in the archipelago east of Java have proven quite unfriendly. Several landing parties have been met with hostility, and a few of the islanders have even dared attempt to sneak aboard the ships of the Treasure Fleet for unknown reasons. It is clear they do not fear the wrath of the Dragon Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9238;I'll teach these savages a lesson!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9238;I'll ignore what happened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9239;I take command of a sizeable detachment of troops from the Treasure Fleet and head ashore on one of the larger islands. Though the jungels are fairly thick we still manage to find our way to a village, and once there we round up a large number of warriors and execute them for crimes against the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9239;Do not trifle with us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9240;I take command of a sizeable detachment of troops from the Treasure Fleet and head ashore on one of the larger islands. The jungles are fairly thick, and thus it is hard to make out where we are going. Instead of encountering an unsuspecting village we run into a large warband, and the resulting battle does not go our way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9240;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9241;I take command of a sizeable detachment of troops from the Treasure Fleet and head ashore on one of the larger islands. We head into the jungle, looking for a village of some kind, but instead we soon find ourselves in the middle of an ambush, and though we attempt to fight our way clear that proves to be impossible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9241;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9242;Several groups of islanders have been rowing out to the Treasure Fleet in order to barter with the sailors. One day one of the islanders spot me aboard the ship when I am carrying an unremarkable porcelain cup. She asks me how much gold I want in exchange for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9242;How much do you have?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9242;You can have it for free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
