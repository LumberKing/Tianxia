EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1002;The Defenders of the Kamuy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1002;In the wake of the Ainu reformation, a number of zealous warriors have banded together to defend the faithful no matter where they might be found. Calling themselves the "Defenders of the Kamuy", their numbers grow larger by the day, and those who would seek to oppose all that is holy will soon learn to fear their presence on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1002;For the Kamuy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1004;Puluga's Warriors;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1004;Following the Andamanese reformation a call to arms has gone out among the faithful with the swiftness of a raging fire, and many have answered the call. In the name of Puluga, a large band of warriors has assembled, seeking to defend all that is holy to the Andamanese people and to bring their deity's fury to bear upon all those that would seek to harm the faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1004;In Puluga's name!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1006;The Swords of the Benzhu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1006;The Benzhuist reformation has not been met with well-wishes from all directions, and though the faith is stronger than it ever has been the faithful will need a force to protect them and all that is holy. As fate would have it, such a force is already assembling, calling itself the "Swords of the Benzhu".\nSoon, all that would oppose them will learn the folly of their ways....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1006;Make the Benzhu proud!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1008;The Defenders of the Nats;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1008;Some might think that the Nat worshippers would be feeling that their faith will be unchallenged following the reformation, but for the most part they would be mistaken. Seeking to ensure the protection of the faithful and all the holy shrines dedicated to the Nats, a band of warrios has assembled. Calling themselves the "Defenders of the Nats", they seem to be looking forward to proving their mettle in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1008;For the Nats!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1010;The Sacred Hunters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1010;The Pemena reformation has ensured that the faith is stronger than ever before, but it is unlikely that those that would seek to harm the faithful will let this deter them. In response to this perceived threat, a force of warriors calling themselves the "Sacred Hunters" has gathered, professing their willingness to bring the fight to the enemy if that is what it takes to guard all that is holy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1010;May our enemies beware!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1012;Guan Yu's Guardians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1012;The Shenist reformation was a most auspicious event, and the faithful rejoice. However, though Heaven's blessing surely has been received, it is clear that there always will be those that would seek to defy all that is right in the world, and that there always must be those that are ready to oppose them. For this purpose, and doubtlessly with the blessing of Guan Yu, a large force of soldiers is being made ready.\nGuan Yu's Guardians will do their namesake proud, or so the faithful would like to believe...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1012;In the name of the god of war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1014;The Guardians of the Bones;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1014;Following the Kaharingan reformation, the sacred nature of the bones of the ancestors of the faithful has become even more evident, and there are those that fear that the enemies of the faith will seek to destroy them. In response to this perceived threat, a band of warriors has gathered. Calling themselves the "Guardians of the Bones", they have sworn to guard the sacred bones and the faithful, and to even take the fight to the enemy if that proves necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1014;Theirs is a sacred task!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1016;The Protectors of Nunuk Ragang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1016;The Momolian faith's holy places must be kept even more secure following the reformation, all the faithful agree. Taking their name from the sacred place where the first of them gathered and swore their oaths, a group of zealous Momolians have formed the "Protectors of Nunuk Ragang". They have sworn to defend the faithful, the sacred places, and the holy relics, come what may.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1016;Protect us all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1018;The Children of the Light;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1018;The light of Inti blesses the world following the Yupaychaspa reformation, but those who have refused to be brought into the light have not ceased their efforts to defy all that is holy. In response to their machinations, an army known as the "Children of the Light" have gathered, seeking to defy all who are friends of the darkness and to bring Inti's light wherever they go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1018;Let the Shadow beware!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1020;The Furious Tempest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1020;[jurchen_pagan_reformed.GetHighGodNameCap] smiles on the faithful following the Jurchen reformation, but not on its enemies. In the name of the sky, a band of zealous warriors have gathered under the banner of the Furious Tempest, swearing to bring their wrath to bear on all that would oppose the faithful. They will strike like the lightning, and their enemies will soon know to fear the thunder of their hooves...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1020;Fear their fury!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1022;The Children of the Morning Calm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1022;The faithful have not been idle following the Muist reformation. While the faith is stronger than ever before, the faithful understand that there might come a day when it is perceived as weak by its enemies, and that the faithful must be prepared for that day. In preparation for this event, a large number of zealous soldiers have come together. Calling themselves the "Children of the Morning Calm", they have sworn to be ready whenever the faithful need them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1022;For the future!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1024;The Spirits' Fury;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1024;In the wake of the Anito reformation, a band of zealous warriors have gathered, swearing to oppose all attempts by other religions to harm the faithful. The "Spirits' Fury", as they are calling themselves, may yet be untested, but more of the faithful are joining their banners each day, and soon they will truly be a force that cannot be ignored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1024;Spirits guide them well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1026;The Warriors of the Waves;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1026;In the wake of the Melanesian reformation word is spreading that a band of zealous warriors is gathering to prepare for the day when the faith truly is tested. These "Warriors of the Waves" are growing in number with each passing day, and the sacred oaths they have sworn should give any that would harm the Melanesian faithful pause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1026;Strike from the sea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1028;The Heavenly Archers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1028;The Kev Dab Qhuas reformation has not been viewed kindly by everyone, even though the faithful naturally view it as a sign of a bright future ahead. Knowing that the faithful might come under attack from those that hate or fear them, a group of soldiers have come together in a display of admirable foresight and zeal. Calling themselves the "Heavenly Archers", they have pledged to take to the field whenever their faith is threatened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1028;May their aim be true!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1030;The Waranei;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1030;A group of zealous warriors have gathered in the wake of the Minahasan reformation. Their clothes, armour, and weapons are painted in red -- perhaps so that the blood that they shed will not detract from their appearance -- and their knowledge of sacred dances and warfare is said to be second to none. Those that dare threatened the faithful will soon learn that they have made a terrible mistake, for the Waranei will oppose them to the last warrior...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1030;Fear them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1032;The Wise Warriors;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1032;A band of warriors has gathered following the Minangkabau reformation, ready to fight and die in the defense of their faith. To the surprise of many, particularly among those opposed to the faith, the stories that are spreading of these warriors do not focus on their great ferocity or their skill at arms, but at their solid grasp of strategy and tactics.\nWhether these "Wise Warriors" will live up to both parts of their name still has to be seen, but it is said that their spirits are high and that their numbers are growing by the day...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1032;Wisdom brings victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1034;The Bear Guard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1034;Fighting with the ferocity of their namesake animal, the Bear Guard stands ready to defy all that would threaten the Nivkh faith. The faithful are sure to see this as a sign that the faith has only grown stronger after the reformation, and their enemies will have to take the presence of these zealous warriors in account whenever they might be taking to the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1034;With the fury of the bear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1036;The Sentinel of Sefa-utaki;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1036;The Ryukyuan faithful have not been idle following the Ryukyuan reformation, and a number of steps have been taken to safeguard the faithful and the holy places. One such step has been the organization of the Sentinels of Sefa-utaki, an army composed of some of the most zealous Ryukyuan soldiers in the world. They have taken sacred oaths to fight to the last to protect all that is sacred and pure in the world, and to ensure that Amamikiyo's will be done.\nWhether these warriors will live up to their oaths is as of yet unknown, but the enemies of the Ryukyuan faith would be wise to take them into account...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1038;Panthoibi's Faithful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1038;The Sanamahi reformation has reinvigorated the faith, and the faithful are seeing it as a victory of the faith over ignorance, superstition, and those that would seek to harm the faithful. Not content with letting this be the only victory for the faith, a band of zealous warriors have banded together in the name of Panthoibi, goddess of victory and warfare, and pledged to fight for the faith against all threats. Though still unproven, the enemies of the Sanamahi faith cannot afford to ignore them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1038;In Panthoibi's service!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1040;The Defenders of Buana Panca Tengah;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1040;The Sunda Wiwitan reformation has strengthened the position of the faithful in Buana Panca Tengah -- the "Middle World", or our world -- and has brought them much joy. Understanding that the enemies of the faithful might still feel inclined to threaten the faithful, a large number of zealous warriors have gathered under the banner of the Defenders of Buana Panca Tengah, swearing to oppose all such foes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1040;Defend our world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1042;The Phi-Sworn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1042;The Satsana Phi reformation has made the faith stronger, and the faithful now look to ensure that the faith's strength never wavers in the face of danger. To this end, a band of zealous warrios has been gathered. Though still untested, these "Phi-Sworn" might soon become a force that cannot be ignored on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1044;In the wake of the Taiwanese reformation a band of zealous warriors has gathered in the name of defending the faith and destroying its foes.

EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1046;The Heavenly Guardians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1046;Heaven smiles on the Thanist faithful following the Thanist reformation. One clear sign of this is the formation of the Heavenly Guardians, an army of zealous soldiers sworn to the defense of the faithful. Though they have yet to take to the field for the first time, the rapid growth of their numbers still means that their existence cannot be safely ignored by those that would threaten the faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1046;In the name of Heaven!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1048;The Swords of the Dragons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1048;The Bimoist reformation has only made the faith stronger, but there are still misguided unbelievers that would seek to oppose the faithful. To ensure that they do not find success in doing so, a number of zealous soldiers have gathered together under the banner of the Swords of the Dragons. More and more are joining the ranks of this army with each passing day, and soon they might truly be a force to fear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1050;In the name of the Ancestors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1052;The Bringers of Harmony;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1052;The Taoist faithful generally seek to live in harmony with those following other faiths, but the same can not be said of all other faiths' view of how they wish to live with the Taoist faithful. As such, as regrettably as it is, a number of zealous Taoists have been forced to come together under the banner of the Bringers of Harmony, prepared to bring harmony through forceful means if that proves necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1053;It has become increasingly clear to the the Confucian faithful that there always must be a force at the ready to defend the faith from those that would seek to harm them and their ways.
