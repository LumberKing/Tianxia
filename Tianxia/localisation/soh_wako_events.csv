EVTDESC_SOH_7301;The population in [Root.GetName] has long had its share of seafarers, but of late many of them have seen fit to change their ways from mostly peaceful fishing to more aggressive raiding. Though they have yet to organize any raids worth speaking of, it is likely that it only is a matter of time before one or more of the captains decides to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7301;That is not ideal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7301;As well they should!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7302;The Wako population in [Root.GetName] has long been involved in small-scale raiding, but it has not been something that has been extensive enough that it has been more than a footnote. However, several influential pirate captains now consider the province their home, and they are actively recruiting sailors and spending their ill-gotten gains in port.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7302;They'd better not raid my coasts...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7303;The more influential pirate captains that once called [Root.GetName] their home have moved their operations elsewhere, and though there might still be a few pirates left in the province that is no more than what would be expected of any coastal province. Maybe this is only a temporary reprieve, or maybe the days of piracy are over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7303;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7303;I have my own raiders...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7304;The Wako pirates in [wako_province.GetName] grow bolder. One of the most influential captains, [wako_raider.GetBestName], has seen fit to assemble a large force of ships and raiders, and now seeks fame and fortune on the seas. Supposedly, [wako_raider.GetSheHe] will only raid abroad, but that might change in the future...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7304;Be gone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7304;Leave, and do not return!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7305;My band of Wako pirates has served me well for many years, but though our raids have been relatively successfully the time has come for us to part ways. Hopefully the gold I have earned will be enough. If not, maybe I will need to gather another crew and set forth on another series of raids...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7305;It was fun while it lasted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
