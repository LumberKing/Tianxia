BM_INTERESTING_TIMES_INFO;The Middle Kingdom is in turmoil, and has been that way ever since Taizu of Liang overthrew the Tang dynasty nearly three decades ago. Seven would-be Emperors of China -- Li Congke of Tang, Liao (Yelu) Deguang of Liao, Shi Jingtang of Jin, Meng Chang of Shu, Yang Pu of Wu, and Liu Yan of Han -- all claim to possess the Mandate of Heaven, but whether one of them, one of their descendants, or someone else will prevail over the others has yet to be determined. Perhaps none of them will prevail and someone else will manage to secure the Dragon Throne, or perhaps the Middle Kingdom will never recover, which no doubt would please at least some of those who have lived in the shadow of the Dragon in the past. Regardless of what the future holds, these are certainly interesting times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_WOUNDED_DRAGON;The Wounded Dragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_WOUNDED_DRAGON_INFO;The An-Shi Rebellion has been crushed, but the Middle Kingdom has yet to fully recover. Many areas still refuse to acknowledge the authority of the Dragon Throne, and with several of them having forged alliances with one another bringing them to heel is unlikely to be an easy task. In the west, several protectorates are still cut off from the heart of the Middle Kingdom due to many formerly Chinese areas falling under Tibetan control, and the Tibetans also maintain their grip over Nanzhao in the south, no doubt eager to oppose any Tang ambitions in the region. Though some of the cries that the Tang dynasty no longer possesses the Mandate of Heaven have died down, putting an end to the lingering doubts is not going to be an easy task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_EMPRESS_IN_THE_EAST;The Three Kings and the Empress;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_EMPRESS_IN_THE_EAST_INFO;East of the Middle Kingdom, Silla is ruled by the eleven-year old Hyegong, perhaps a sign that trouble is to come. To Silla's north, Yeojeong of Goguryeo desperately clings on to the few scraps of land that remain under his control, while Mun of Balhae tries to keep his culturally and religiously diverse realm together. In Japan, Empress Shotoku sits on the Chrysanthemum Throne for the second time, with the monk Dokyo tending to her health and perhaps also spending time in her bedchamber. The northern frontier of her realm is supposedly safeguarded by Korehazi Azamaro, an Emishi warlord that has pledged himself to the Chrysanthemum Throne, but he may or may not have ambitions beyond continued subservience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_RISE_OF_THE_REGENT;Rise of the Regent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_RISE_OF_THE_REGENT_INFO;Though Emperor Seiwa recently came of age, his maternal grandfather -- Fujiwara no Yoshifusa -- still serves as his Regent, an unpredecented turn of events that may or may not cause trouble for the other clans in Japan. On the mainland, Li Wen rules Tang in a manner that many might consider irresponsible, and the dynasty has yet to recover fully from the An-Shi Rebellion despite over a century having passed since it was crushed. Though the fall of the Tibetan Empire means the western border is more secure, the Dragon Throne's power is not what it once was, and there are those that whisper that perhaps the Mandate of Heaven no longer belongs to the Tang dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_DYNASTIES_OF_THE_SOUTH;The Dynasties of the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_DYNASTIES_OF_THE_SOUTH_INFO;The influence of the Sailedra dynasty, successor of the Srivijaya dynasty, extends quite far, though not as far as it once did. In Java, Maharaja Lokapala, the nephew of the Sailedra ruler Maharajahiraja Balaputradeva, continues to defy Palembang like his mother before him, and in Bali Kesari Warmadewa, supposedly a bastard prince, has ambitions of his own. In northern Sumatra, the faith of the Prophet is spreading, while the Khmer Empire is growing stronger on the mainland, currently under the rule of Chakravartin Jayavarman III. To his north and west, Champa, once a bastion of the Hindu faith, is now under the rule of the Buddhist Indravarman II, whose new dynasty might be threatened by the Khmers but might stand to gain from the weakening Tang to his north.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_GREAT_AMBITIONS;Great Ambitions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_GREAT_AMBITIONS_INFO;As the Middle Kingdom is waging war on itself Taejo of Goryeo wages war on Hubaekje, seeking to unite the Korean Peninsula once more, and perhaps even expand beyond it while the Dragon Throne remains unable to interfere. Across the Tsushima Strait, the child-emperor Suzaku sits on the Chrysanthemum Throne and Fujiwara no Tadahira, the Regent, exercises great power at his behest, all in the name of the good of the realm, though Fujiwara no Sumitomo and Taira no Masakado are amassing personal power at an alarming rate. And, far to the north, Hanpu, chieftain of the Wanyan clan, is moving to unite the Jurchen tribes, perhaps making the first moves towards the founding of a dynasty that one day will claim the Mandate of Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_UNSTABLE_SOUTH;The Unstable South;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_UNSTABLE_SOUTH_INFO;Having recently thrown back the forces of Han, Duong Dinh-Nghe of Annam has ambitions to secure and perhaps expand his rule, but his vassal Kieu Cong-Tien might have plans of his own that do not bode well for his liege. Further west, Yang Ganzhen rules Da Yining as the first ruler of the third dynasty on the throne in the span of just a few decades. Having failed to imprison his vassal Duan Siping, his rule might not last much longer. South of Annam, the Khmer Empire has expanded west and south, but with new lands come new problems that might threaten the empire's stability. To their south, the Sailedra dynasty's hold endures, but religious tensions and other problems might yet prove its undoing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_EMPIRES_IN_THE_NORTH;The Empires in the North;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_EMPIRES_IN_THE_NORTH_INFO;Minamoto no Yoshiie, now known as "Hachimantaro" (the son of Hachiman), has triumphed over the Abe clan and the northernmost part of Honshu is once more at peace and firmly controlled by the Kiyohara clan, which no doubt pleases the Chrysanthemum Throne and Fujiwara no Yorimichi, sometimes called "Ichi no Hito" (the First Subject), who wields more power than any Regent before him save perhaps his father. On the mainland, the Song dynasty has lasted for over a hundred years and controls most of the Middle Kingdom, but the Sixteen Prefectures are still firmly in the grip of the Liao dynasty, which still claims the Dragon Throne and which has been receiving tribute from Song for over six decades, and in the west the Tangut realm of Xia also claims the Mandate of Heaven despite being fairly weak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_RISE_AND_FALL_OF_EMPIRES;Rise and Fall of Empires;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_RISE_AND_FALL_OF_EMPIRES_INFO;The once-great realm ruled by the Sailendra dynasty has yet to recover from the Chola attack and the sack of Palembang nearly four decades back, and many of its former subjects refuse to acknowledge its authority, confident that their former overlord will be unable to punish their defiance. Further north, the Khmer Empire endures, though it has lost its grip on its western lands, and perhaps they never will regain those unless a strong ruler arises. Further west, Anawrahta of Bagan is consolidating his rule over his newly conquered subjects, but whether his dynasty will maintain their grip over the region has yet to be determined as the Bagan Empire is quite young indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_JIN_SONG_WAR;A Clash of Dragons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_JIN_SONG_WAR_INFO;Bianjing, the capital of the Song dynasty since the time of Taizu, has fallen to the newly proclaimed Jin dynasty, a dynasty of Jurchen rather than Han origin. The invaders have appointed Zhang Bangchang, a former Song official, as the ruler of the newly formed state of Chu, but none really believe that he is anything but a Jurchen puppet. The war goes on, with neither side eager to sue for peace. In Angkor, Chakravartin Suryavarman II rules, having begun the construction of the temple city of Angkor Wat and looking to expand his realm through conquest. To his south, Raja Dubaraja II ponders matters of religion and whether to openly embrace his Sunni faith, while Raja Kameshwara prepares to Javanese reunite the lands once ruled by Airlangga under his son, Jayabaya.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
