EVTDESC_SOH_8001;I have just received word that the Treasure Fleet is ready for departure. All those that are due to accompany it are making their way to where the fleet has gathered at this very moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8001;It will be auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8002;I have just been informed that the Treasure Fleet's departure is imminent. My presence aboard is expected without further delay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8002;All aboard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8004;As I am about to depart for the Treasure Fleet I am approached by [From.GetBestName]. It seems [From.GetSheHe] desires to accompany me aboard the Treasure Fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8004;Of course you can come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8004;I need you to stay here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8005;Nobody has seen fit to ask if I want to go with the Treasure Fleet to the strange lands it will visit. What if it is the only Treasure Fleet that sails, and I miss my chance just because I am not an adult?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8005;Maybe I can sneak aboard?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8005;I shouldn't...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8006;I managed to sneak past the guards near one of the ships while they were busy checking the official-looking documents being presented by some of the bureaucrats coming on the voyage and made my way aboard the ship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8006;Adventure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8007;I find myself somewhat distracted by the grand spectacle surrounding the Treasure Fleet and fail to pay attention to those around me for some time. Once I turn my attention back to my companions I realize that someone is missing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8007;Has anyone seen [From.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8008;I thought I could make my way onto one of the ships without being discovered, but the guards were more watchful than I had expected and managed to grab me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8008;That didn't go so well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8009;As I am watching various officials moving aboard the Treasure Fleet a small number of guards approach me, bringing [From.GetBestName] with them. It seems [From.GetSheHe] sought to sneak aboard the Treasure Fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8009;Never try something like that again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8010;I have been informed that [From.GetBestName] sought to sneak aboard the Treasure Fleet but that [From.GetSheHe] was caputed by the guards. The child apparently has feels [From.GetSheHe] is missing out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8010;The Treasure Fleet is no place for children!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8010;I will allow [From.GetHerHim] to accompany the Treasure Fleet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8011;[From.GetBestName] was quite unhappy with my attempt to sneak aboard the Treasure Fleet and told me never to try anything like that again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8011;I need to be more convincing next time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8011;I need to be sneakier next time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_8011;I shouldn't try again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8012;It seems [From.GetBestName] thinks I should get to accompany the Treasure Fleet! With the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's permission, I will definitely get to go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8012;Adventure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8013;I have been informed that the [FromFrom.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven [FromFrom.GetHerHim]self thinks that [From.GetFirstName] should be permitted to accompany the Treasure Fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8013;Very well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_8015;The Treasure Fleet Departs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8015;Tens of thousands of people from all social classes have gathered to witness the departure of the Treasure Fleet, watching from the shoreline, from various vantage points, and from aboard a number of smaller ships that are not part of the Treasure Fleet.\n\nAs far as anyone on the shore can tell, things are going quite well, and the huge ships are quite imposing, showing everyone that the might of the Middle Kingdom and the Dragon Throne is unparallelled, which should convince anyone the fleet encounters to avoid confrontation and to provide whatever assistance they can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8015;Auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_8016;Tens of thousands of people from all social classes have gathered to witness the departure of the Treasure Fleet, watching from the shoreline, from various vantage points, and from aboard a number of smaller ships that are not part of the Treasure Fleet.\n\nAs I am not a common sailor I do not need to concern myself with the work needed to get the fleet in motion, and I do my best to stay out of the way of the sailors as I take in the sight of the rest of the ships. They truly are imposing, and I am confident that everyone we encounter during the journey will be suitably impressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8016;Auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_8018;I have received word that the Treasure Fleet has departed at long last. The messenger that brought me this information witnessed it personally, and claims that the departure was largely uneventful, if still a sight to behold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8018;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8018;This does not concern me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_8018;I was hoping for better news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_8019;An Azure Visitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8019;Tens of thousands of people from all social classes have gathered to witness the departure of the Treasure Fleet, watching from the shoreline, from various vantage points, and from aboard a number of smaller ships that are not part of the Treasure Fleet.\n\nSuddenly, the surface of the water splits apart for a moment some distance beyond the most distant ship, and a serpentine dragon with azure scales rises into the air. It flies towards the Treasure Fleet and then circles it several times before turning around and flying off towards the open sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8019;Most auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It flies towards the fleet and starts circling it, with an expression that probably is a smile apparent on its face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_8022;I have received word that the Treasure Fleet has departed at long last. The messenger that brought me this information witnessed it personally, and claims that an azure dragon paid a visit to the fleet shortly after it had left port, which might imply that the voyage is a blessed one indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8022;Unexpected news indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8022;This does not really concern me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Looking towards the sound, I can see a massive crimson shape flying towards the Treasure Fleet. Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, appears to have taken the Treasure Fleet as a personal affront, as he descends on it and unleashes his fiery breath, setting the ships ablaze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_8026;How dreadful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8026;I almost feel bad for them. Almost...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It seems the fleet was not constructed to handle even the tiniest gust of wind, as it has been destroyed even before it really could get underway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It seems the voyage will be a short one, and that I must swim to safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The messenger that brought ne this information witnessed the event personally, and he tells me that the fleet apparently was so poorly constructed that the first gust of wind saw the ships topple, resulting in the deaths of many of those that were aboard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8030;So much for that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8030;Auspicious indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
