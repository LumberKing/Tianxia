EVTDESC_DISCLAIMER_1;You have selected a start date after 1127.4.20, which is the latest fully supported start. The date you have selected is fairly likely to have extensive historical issues (missing wars, missing important characters, etc.) and possibly other bugs.\nANY issues you experience using this start date WILL NOT be a priority to fix before we are prepared to fully support this start date, and it is thus EXTREMELY UNLIKELY to be fixed in the short term, regardless of severity. The ONLY issues we'll consider fixing in the short term are “Missing holder”, “Instant game over”, and “Incorrect top liege” (outside vanilla areas).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
