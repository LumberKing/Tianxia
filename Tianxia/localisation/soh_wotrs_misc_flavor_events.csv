EVTDESC_SOH_3301;I am having a meal at a local tavern along with some other Warriors of the Rising Sun when one of them suddenly suggests that we should have a drinking contest. Several of the others express an interest in joining, and I suppose I could as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3301;A worthy challenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3301;A waste of my time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3302;After a decent number of rounds are done several of the other contestants declare that their forfeit, clearly not feeling confident in their ability to keep more sake down. I am having no such problems, and judging by how the few opponents that are left are doing I think I could win this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3302;Bring me another!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3302;Actually, I've had enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3303;After a decent number of rounds are done several of the other contestants declare that their forfeit, clearly not feeling confident in their ability to keep more sake down. I am doing fairly well, but so are my remaining opponents, so it is unclear how much more I would have to drink to beat them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3303;It should be fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3303;I should drink in moderation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3304;After a decent number of rounds are done several of the other contestants declare that their forfeit, clearly not feeling confident in their ability to keep more sake down. I am not feeling as well as I would like, while my remaining opponents are looking as if they are doing well. Perhaps beating them will be very hard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3304;I... I can do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3304;I can't win this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3305;One after the other my opponents either surrender gracefully or run off in the direction of the door after having had one drink too many. In the end I am the only one still in the contest, and victory is thus mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3305;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3306;One after the other my opponents either surrender gracefully or run off in the direction of the door after having had one drink too many. I end up having to drink quite a bit to outlast them all, but it is worth it as I end up the undisputed winner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3306;I look forward to next time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3307;One after the other my opponents either surrender gracefully or run off in the direction of the door after having had one drink too many. I am having no such problems, and can keep drinking by the time that I have won;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3307;Bring me another!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3308;One after the other my opponents either surrender gracefully or run off in the direction of the door after having had one drink too many. I remember winning the contest, but after that things get very hazy up until somewhere after I returned home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3308;I... suppose that worked...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3309;As the sake keeps coming I get less and less certain that I will be able to win the drinking contest, and by a certain point it is clear that I should stop drinking. Not wanting to make a fool of myself, I forfeit at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3309;You can't win them all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3310;As the sake keeps coming I get less and less certain that I will be able to win the drinking contest, and by a certain point it is clear that I should stop drinking. I have to forfeit at this point, but I must admit that I rather liked taking part in the drinking contest even so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3310;I'll win the next one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3311;As the sake keeps coming I get less and less certain that I will be able to win the drinking contest. Eventually, it becomes clear I should have stopped drinking several drinks back, as I am having trouble keeping the sake down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3311;Out of my way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3312;As the sake keeps coming I get less and less certain that I will be able to win the drinking contest even though I am a heavy drinker. My memory is hazy about just what happened towards the end of the contest other than the fact that I lost, and I wake up with a splitting headache the next morning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3312;My head...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3313;Though there are some Warriors of the Rising Sun that think that anything that is not useful in either warfare or personal combat is useless, there are also those that consider other skills worthwhile. Many have an interest in poetry, and I could certainly engage in that if I feel like it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3313;I should write a poem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3313;I have better things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3314;I could either write a poem dedicated to someone, or a poem just for myself. In the former case, I suppose I do not have to share the poem if I do not like what I have written, but sharing a good poem could be impress people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3314;My poem will be for [dedication_option_1.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3314;[dedication_option_2.GetBestName] deserves a poem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3314;I should write [dedication_option_3.GetBestName] a poem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3314;I'll just write it for myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3315;Before I can get started on my poem I need to decide what the topic will be. I can think of more than one topic, though I am not sure if they are equally appealing to me, or if they are things I would be equally good at.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3315;I'll go for flattery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3315;Mockery is the right choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3315;I'll attempt to flirt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3315;I'll write about warfare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_3315;Nature is a good subject!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_3315;I'll write about the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_SOH_3315;It'll be about single combat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3316;My poem is finally complete. Though I am not the most impartial judge of my own ability, I would think this is a very flattering poem, and I doubt [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetBestName] would find it at all disagreeable to read it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3316;I'm sure it'll be appreciated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3316;I'll keep this for myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3316;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3317;My poem is finally complete. I doubt anyone would consider it a masterpiece, but I doubt [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetBestName] would find it unflattering at the very least, and perhaps that is sufficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3317;I think this is worth sharing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3317;It's not good enough to share...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3317;I suppose it's acceptable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3318;My poem is finally complete. As much as I would prefer to pretend otherwise, it is really not a particularly good poem. [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetBestName] is unlikely to find this particularly flattering, and might even find it a bit offensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3318;Maybe it won't be so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3318;Nobody can ever see this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3318;I should burn this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3319;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], bringing a poem that [From.GetSheHe] apparently has dedicated to me. [Root.GetFlatteringPoemQualityDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsGoodFlatteringPoem;The poem turns out to be quite impressive, and it speaks quite highly of me and my many good qualities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsBadFlatteringPoem;I think [From.GetSheHe] was going for flattery, but the poem certainly did not come across that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsAverageFlatteringPoem;The poem is about what [From.GetBestName] thinks are my best qualities, though the quality of the poem is not the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3319;[From.GetSheHeCap] is a good friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3319;Maybe we can be friends?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3319;I'm not sure how to take this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3319;That was almost insulting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3320;My good friend [From.GetBestName] has send word that [From.GetSheHe] found the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim] quite flattering indeed, and that [From.GetSheHe] is glad I am [From.GetHerHis] friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3320;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3321;It seems [From.GetBestName] truly appreciated my poem and found it very flattering, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] thinks we should be friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3321;That sounds like a great idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3321;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3322;[From.GetBestName] was most happy to hear that I thought that we should be friends, and [From.GetSheHe] let me know that I most definitely can consider [From.GetHerHim] a friend from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3322;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3323;Though [From.GetBestName] did not seem displeased to hear that I had found [From.GetHerHis] poem quite flattering [From.GetSheHe] made it clear that [From.GetSheHe] does not think [From.GetSheHe] knows me well enough to call me [From.GetHerHis] friend just yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3323;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3324;I had hoped that [From.GetBestName] would let me know what [From.GetSheHe] thought of the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim], but [From.GetSheHe] apparently does not seem interested in responding to it in any way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3324;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3325;The response I got from [From.GetBestName] regarding my poem was certainly not what I had expected. [From.GetSheHeCap] almost seemed offended by having received it, which was the opposite of what I had hoped for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3325;That could have gone better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3326;My poem is finally complete. Though I am not the most impartial judge of my own ability, I would think that [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetBestName] will find the mockery in this poem to be particularly vicious, and that [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetSheHe] will find it hard to refute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3326;I'm sure this will be upsetting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3326;I'll keep this for myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3326;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3327;My poem is finally complete. I doubt anyone would consider it a masterpiece, but [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetBestName] will likely find it mocking even so, and that might be good enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3327;I think this works!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3327;It's not good enough to share...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3327;I suppose it's acceptable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3328;My poem is finally complete. As much as I would prefer to pretend otherwise, it is really not a particularly good poem. While I think [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetBestName] would be able to tell I was trying to mock [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetHerHim], [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetSheHe] might mock the quality of my writing if [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetSheHe] gets to read this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3328;Well, [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetSheHe] doesn't deserve a good poem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3328;Nobody can ever see this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3328;I should burn this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3329;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], bringing a poem that [From.GetSheHe] apparently has dedicated to me. [Root.GetMockingPoemQualityDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsGoodMockingPoem;Though the poem is very good from a quality standpoint, it also turns out to be a very viciously mocking poem about me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsBadMockingPoem;It seems likely [From.GetBestName] was trying to mock me, but the quality of the poem is terrible enough that that is almost impossible to tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsAverageMockingPoem;The poem is certainly not the best I have read, and [From.GetBestName]'s attempt to mock me in the poem leaves something to be desired.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3329;How dare you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3329;I'll never forgive this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3329;It was fairly mild...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3329;This is an insult to poetry, not to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3330;I have received word that [From.GetBestName] seems to have taken the mockery in the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim] quite personally. Considering we have been rivals for some time, [From.GetSheHe] certainly should not have expected a kinder poem from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3330;That went as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3331;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] considers the fact that I would send [From.GetHerHim] a poem like the one I wrote utterly dishonorable, and that it is clear I wish for us to be enemies. It seems my mockery was not just vicious, but also quite effective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3331;Just as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3332;I had hoped that [From.GetBestName] would let me know what [From.GetSheHe] thought of the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim], but [From.GetSheHe] apparently does not seem interested in responding to it in any way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3332;I should have mocked [From.GetHerHim] more thoroughly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3333;I had not expected [From.GetBestName] to praise my poem, but [From.GetSheHe] went as far as to call it an insult to poetry. [From.GetSheHeCap] was also rather dismissive of my attempt to mock [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3333;I'll never forgive this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3334;It seems [From.GetBestName] now considers us to be enemies, largely thanks to the brutally honest feedback I sent [From.GetHerHim] regarding the rather terrible poem [From.GetSheHe] wrote in an attempt to mock me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3334;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3335;[From.GetBestName] has certainly proven that [From.GetSheHe] deserves to be my rival today, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to send me a letter in which [From.GetSheHe] makes it clear that [From.GetSheHe] considers my latest poem an insult to poetry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3335;How dare you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3336;My poem is finally complete. Though I am not the most impartial judge of my own ability, I would expect [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetBestName] to find this poem quite charming, and [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetSheHe] will hopefully take an interest in me when [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetSheHe] reads it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3336;I'm sure it'll be appreciated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3336;I'll keep this for myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3336;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3337;My poem is finally complete. I doubt anyone would consider it a masterpiece, but maybe [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetBestName] will still find it somewhat charming, even if I should not have too high hopes about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3337;I think this is worth sharing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3337;It's not good enough to share...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3337;I suppose it's acceptable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3338;My poem is finally complete. As much as I would prefer to pretend otherwise, it is really not a particularly good poem. It is possible [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetBestName] would not be offended by it, but I really doubt [i_am_getting_a_poem.GetSheHe] would find it particularly charming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3338;Maybe it won't be so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3338;Nobody can ever see this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3338;I should burn this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3339;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], bringing a poem that [From.GetSheHe] apparently has dedicated to me. [Root.GetFlirtingPoemQualityDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsGoodFlirtingPoem;The poetry is quite charming, and also rather suggestive, and I am pretty sure [From.GetBestName] likes me quite a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsBadFlirtingPoem;I think [From.GetSheHe] was trying to come across as charming, but the writing is quite obscene, and the poem is most certainly not good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsAverageFlirtingPoem;The poem is somewhat suggestive, and a bit charming, though it is not a true masterpiece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3339;[From.GetSheHeCap] definitely loves me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3339;I should proposition [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3339;I should not encourage this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3339;That wasn't a great poem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_3339;That was pretty terrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3340;[From.GetBestName] has let me know that [From.GetSheHe] definitely appreciated the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim], and that [From.GetHerHis] love for me has never been greater than it is now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3340;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3341;It seems the poem I sent [From.GetBestName] was quite effective as [From.GetSheHe] has come to me with the suggestion that we perhaps should become lovers, or at least should have a good tumble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3341;We should become lovers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3341;I'll give [From.GetHerHim] a good tumble!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3341;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3342;[From.GetBestName] was open to the idea of getting to know me rather more intimately, much as I had expected, and by the time we had to part ways for the time being [From.GetSheHe] let me know that [From.GetSheHe] looks forward to similar activities together in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3342;This is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3343;[From.GetBestName] was open to the idea of getting to know me rather more intimately, much as I had expected. [From.GetSheHeCap] did, however, make it clear that it only was a one-time thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3343;That's fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3344;It is possible I misjudged [From.GetBestName]'s intentions with the poem, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] turned down my suggestion that we should get to know one another rather more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3344;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3345;I had hoped that [From.GetBestName] would let me know what [From.GetSheHe] thought of the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim], but [From.GetSheHe] apparently does not seem interested in responding to it in any way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3345;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3346;[From.GetBestName] did not seem to find my poem at all charming, and it is possible [From.GetSheHe] found it insulting instead considering that [From.GetSheHe] suggested that I should refrain from trying something similar in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3346;That could have gone better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3347;My poem is finally complete. Though I am not the most impartial judge of my own ability, I think I truly have managed to convey what I wished to say about warfare, which is a topic the Warriors of the Rising Sun tend to approve of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3347;I'm sure it'll be appreciated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3347;I'll keep this for myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3347;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3348;My poem is finally complete. I doubt anyone would consider it a masterpiece, but maybe some Warriors of the Rising Sun would still appreciate it since I have given a fairly decent account of the matter of warfare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3348;I think this is worth sharing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3348;It's not good enough to share...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3348;I suppose it's acceptable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3349;My poem is finally complete. As much as I would prefer to pretend otherwise, it is really not a particularly good poem. I suspect most Warriors of the Rising Sun that might read it would find my depiction of warfare rather questionable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3349;Maybe it won't be so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3349;Nobody can ever see this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3349;I should burn this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3350;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], bringing a poem that [From.GetSheHe] apparently has dedicated to me. [Root.GetWarfarePoemQualityDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsGoodWarfarePoem;[From.GetBestName] has written about warfare, and it is clear that [From.GetSheHe] has a good grasp of both this and poetry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsBadWarfarePoem;It is a rather confusing poem about warfare, and I am not sure whether the quality of the poem or the description of warfare is worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsAverageWarfarePoem;I would say it is a decent poem, though the way [From.GetBestName] writes about warfare is not as good as it could be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3350;An excellent poem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3350;I suppose it could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3350;That was pretty bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3351;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] really liked the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim] and that [From.GetSheHe] looks forward to reading more poems by me in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3351;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3352;I had hoped that [From.GetBestName] would let me know what [From.GetSheHe] thought of the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim], but [From.GetSheHe] apparently does not seem interested in responding to it in any way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3352;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3353;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim] was not really to [From.GetHerHis] liking, and a polite suggestion that I either should spend quite a bit of time practicing poetry before sharing any more of it or should consider doing something else entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3353;Very unfortunate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3354;My poem is finally complete. Though I am not the most impartial judge of my own ability, I think I have managed to describe the beauty of nature in a fashion that would make even a blind [Root.GetManWoman] able to understand it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3354;I'm sure it'll be appreciated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3354;I'll keep this for myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3354;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3355;My poem is finally complete. I doubt anyone would consider it a masterpiece, but I suppose it could be considerably worse. At least I have not just written something involving nothing but cherry blossoms...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3355;I think this is worth sharing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3355;It's not good enough to share...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3355;I suppose it's acceptable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3356;My poem is finally complete. As much as I would prefer to pretend otherwise, it is really not a particularly good poem. Everything I could think about when writing it was cherry blossoms, and I am not sure I even described those particularly well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3356;Maybe it won't be so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3356;Nobody can ever see this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3356;I should burn this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3357;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], bringing a poem that [From.GetSheHe] apparently has dedicated to me. [Root.GetNaturePoemQualityDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsGoodNaturePoem;[From.GetBestName] has written a very beautiful poem about nature, which is unlike anything I have ever read in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsBadNaturePoem;The poem turns out to be a very unimaginative and poorly written description of cherry blossoms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsAverageNaturePoem;I would not say [From.GetBestName] has written a masterpiece, but at least it is somewhat imaginative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3357;An excellent poem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3357;I suppose it could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3357;That was pretty bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_3358;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_3361;My poem is finally complete. Though I am not the most impartial judge of my own ability, I would say that what I have written would impress nearly everyone that follows the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3361;I'm sure it'll be appreciated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3361;I'll keep this for myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3361;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3362;My poem is finally complete. I doubt anyone would consider it a masterpiece, but I doubt any but the most critical of readers would say that I have written something that would offend the faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3362;I think this is worth sharing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3362;It's not good enough to share...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3362;I suppose it's acceptable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3363;My poem is finally complete. As much as I would prefer to pretend otherwise, it is really not a particularly good poem. A very forgiving reader might give me the benefit of the doubt, but most would likely think I meant to offend the faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3363;Maybe it won't be so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3363;Nobody can ever see this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3363;I should burn this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3364;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], bringing a poem that [From.GetSheHe] apparently has dedicated to me. [Root.GetReligionPoemQualityDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsGoodReligionPoem;[From.GetSheHe] has written about the [From.Religion.GetName] faith in a truly beautiful fashion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsBadReligionPoem;I think [From.GetBestName] was trying to impress those following the [From.Religion.GetName] faith, but the poem comes across as somewhat offensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsAverageReligionPoem;I think the poem is decent, but perhaps [From.GetSheHe] should not have written about the [From.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3364;An excellent poem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3364;I suppose it could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3364;That was pretty bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3365;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] really liked the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim] and that [From.GetSheHe] looks forward to reading more poems by me in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3365;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3366;I had hoped that [From.GetBestName] would let me know what [From.GetSheHe] thought of the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim], but [From.GetSheHe] apparently does not seem interested in responding to it in any way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3366;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3367;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim] was not really to [From.GetHerHis] liking, and a polite suggestion that I either should spend quite a bit of time practicing poetry before sharing any more of it or should consider doing something else entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3367;Very unfortunate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3368;My poem is finally complete. Though I am not the most impartial judge of my own ability, I think I have managed to describe the matter of personal combat in a very satisfactory fashion, and the Warriors of the Rising Sun would likely approve of the poem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3368;I'm sure it'll be appreciated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3368;I'll keep this for myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3368;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3369;My poem is finally complete. I doubt anyone would consider it a masterpiece, but I feel I got at least some things across when it comes to the matter of personal combat, so some Warriors of the Rising Sun might like it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3369;I think this is worth sharing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3369;It's not good enough to share...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3369;I suppose it's acceptable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3370;My poem is finally complete. As much as I would prefer to pretend otherwise, it is really not a particularly good poem. I suspect most Warriors of the Rising Sun would find my depiction of personal combat confusing at best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3370;Maybe it won't be so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3370;Nobody can ever see this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3370;I should burn this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3371;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], bringing a poem that [From.GetSheHe] apparently has dedicated to me. [Root.GetPCSPoemQualityDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsGoodPCSPoem;It is a very evocative depiction of personal combat, and I have never read anything as good in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsBadPCSPoem;It is about personal combat, I can tell, but it is too confusing to tell much aside from that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
IsAveragePCSPoem;[From.GetBestName] has written about personal combat, and though the poem is no masterpiece it is also not a bad poem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3371;An excellent poem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3371;I suppose it could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3371;That was pretty bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3372;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] really liked the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim] and that [From.GetSheHe] looks forward to reading more poems by me in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3372;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3373;I had hoped that [From.GetBestName] would let me know what [From.GetSheHe] thought of the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim], but [From.GetSheHe] apparently does not seem interested in responding to it in any way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3373;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3374;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that the poem I sent [From.GetHerHim] was not really to [From.GetHerHis] liking, and a polite suggestion that I either should spend quite a bit of time practicing poetry before sharing any more of it or should consider doing something else entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3374;Very unfortunate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3375;I got the response I was hoping for to my latest poem, and I think it is clear I have some talent for poetry and that I should consider writing more poetry in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3375;I can call myself a poet now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3376;I already considered myself a skilled poet before sending out my latest creation, and seeing as the response I received to it was what I was hoping for it is clear that I am not mistaken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3376;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3377;I have never been particularly good at the field my education was focused on. Perhaps I should instead focus on warfare, particularly as that would be quite appreciated by the Warriors of the Rising Sun?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3377;That would be a good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3377;No, I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3378;As a Warrior of the Rising Sun I have been expected to at least maintain my current level of skill with various weapons, and as a result of sparring with them quite a bit I have become stronger than I used to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3378;I feel powerful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3379;In order to not come across as a complete fool when discussing matters of warfare with my fellow Warriors of the Rising Sun I have needed to spend some time reading up on various related things, and I have come to realize that I really enjoy doing that far more than I had thought I would;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3379;This isn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3380;Though there are some that think that aggression is the best approach to combat my time among the Warriors of the Rising Sun has made me realize that that is not really the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3380;A warrior's greatest weapon... is patience!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3381;After seeing several rather arrogant members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun get defeated in personal combat by opponents they underestimated I have become quite aware that being proud of your skills is not the same as actually being skilled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3381;Arrogance is a weakness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3382;Being a Warrior of the Rising Sun means that I certainly am one of the better warriors in the world, and a skilled general on top of that. After all, we do not allow just anyone to join our ranks...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3382;I have reason to be proud!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3383;As a Warrior of the Rising Sun I can most likely find allies or rally soldiers to my cause more easily than most, and though I certainly do not have to take advantage of that I am starting to think that I probabaly should.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3383;I should strive for more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3384;The Warriors of the Rising Sun do not approve of cowardice, and though there was a time when some of them would have considered me a coward I have been working hard to get past my fear, and I have certainly become braver as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3384;Fear is for the enemy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3385;Though there are ways in which one can get ahead by being dishonest the Warriors of the Rising Sun do not approve of such tactics, and over time I have come to realize that I agree more and more with that sentiment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3385;There is no honor in dishonesty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3386;There are some that would say that honor only is for the battlefield and duels, but others would say that there is no honor in injustice. I am finding myself agreeing with the latter group more and more as a result of my time as a Warrior of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3386;Honor and justice must prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3387;It is well known that the Warriors of the Rising Sun value honor and honesty. As such, it should be clear to everyone that my rival,  [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName], is not worthy of anyone's respect, but sadly few seem to have noticed this. Perhaps I could change that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3387;I will give it a try...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3387;This is not worth my time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3388;[From.GetBestName] approached me today to discuss the matter of [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. I have long known that the two of them do not like one another, but I had not heard the full story before, and after hearing it it is clear to me that I must help [From.GetBestName] against [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName] in whatever manner I can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3388;It is the right thing to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3389;I have learned that my hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], has spoken to [From.GetBestName] about me. Despite the fact that it is [FromFrom.GetBestName] that has been acting in a dishonorable manner when interacting with me it seems that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] still has managed to convince [From.GetBestName] that [From.GetSheHe] should oppose me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3389;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3390;[From.GetBestName] listened carefully to what I told [From.GetHerHim] about [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName], and once I had finished [From.GetSheHe] told me that [From.GetSheHe] was convinced I am in the right. The fact that I embellished a few things here and there and skipped some minor details about my own doings probably helped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3390;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3391;[From.GetBestName] approached me today to discuss the matter of [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. Based on what I was told it is very possible that [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName] is dishonorable and should be regarded as a threat, but as [From.GetBestName] very likely is biased I am not entirely certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3391;Maybe I should keep my guard up...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3392;I have learned that my hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], has spoken to [From.GetBestName] about me and my actions. Though it seems that [From.GetBestName] has some reservations [From.GetSheHe] still seems to be at least somewhat convinced that my dishonorable rival is correct about me being dishonorable, even though this obviously is false.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3392;This could be bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3393;[From.GetBestName] listened carefully to what I had to say about [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName], and though [From.GetSheHe] told me that [From.GetSheHe] was not fully convinced that things are as bad as I told [From.GetHerHim] I believe I still managed to make [From.GetHerHim] at least somewhat suspicious of my rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3393;I suppose it's a start...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3394;[From.GetBestName] approached me today to discuss the matter of [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] had quite a few things to say about [From.GetHerHis] rival, and what [From.GetSheHe] told me would certainly be cause for concern if [From.GetSheHe] was speaking truthfully, but I am unsure whether that was the case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3394;I'm not sure what to think...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3395;[From.GetBestName] listened carefully to what I had to say about [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. I had expected my arguments to be sufficient, but when I was finished [From.GetBestName] told me that [From.GetSheHe] is no more convinced than when I started.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3395;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3396;[From.GetBestName] approached me today to discuss the matter of [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. Though [From.GetBestName] could point to many things that [From.GetSheHe] thought would prove that [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName] is dishonorable and someone that should be my enemy I felt that the story [From.GetBestName] told me was somewhat distorted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3396;It certainly was a bit suspect...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3397;I have learned that my hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], has spoken to [From.GetBestName] about me and my actions. It seems that [From.GetSheHe] was unconvinced, however, and that [From.GetSheHe] now might be a bit more inclined to take my side over the side of [FromFrom.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3397;That is good to know...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3398;[From.GetBestName] listened carefully to what I had to say about [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName], and when I was finished [From.GetSheHe] told me that some of the things I said really did not make much sense. As I had to be a bit creative about how I framed some things that is perhaps to be expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3398;I suppose it could have gone worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3399;[From.GetBestName] approached me today to discuss the matter of [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. As far as I could tell, [From.GetSheHe] was blowing things massively out of proportion, and [From.GetHerHis] own actions seemed rather dishonest when I considered them more carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3399;It is the other way around!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3400;I have learned that my hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], has spoken to [From.GetBestName] about me and my actions. Luckily for me, my rival failed to make [FromFrom.GetHerHis] lies convincing, and [From.GetBestName] now considers me a friend and my rival [From.GetHerHis] enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3400;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3401;[From.GetBestName] listened carefully to what I had to say about [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName], and when I was done [From.GetSheHe] told me that what I said simply convinced [From.GetHerHim] that I was the dishonorable party and that [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName] is in the right. It seems I have gained a new enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3401;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3402;Today I took part in a discussion about the advancement of military knowledge with other members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun. Though it of course is important to preserve old and honorable traditions, some new advances can still be taken advantage of, and I learned about a number of promising things today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3402;A valuable discussion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3403;Some other Warriors of the Rising Sun have invited me to participate in a discussion of matters related to warfare in the hopes that we all may learn something from one another. I am free to turn down the offer, of course, but perhaps it would be in my interest to participate?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3403;I will participate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3403;I have better things to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3404;I did quite well during the discussion with the other Warriors of the Rising Sun, and while I did not learn anything in particular several of the others praised my knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3404;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3405;I did quite well during the discussion with the other Warriors of the Rising Sun, and while I did not learn anything in particular several of the others praised my knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3405;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3406;I learned a lot discussing martial matters some other Warriors of the Rising Sun, and I feel I really have a much better understanding of the subject now than I had previously.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3406;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3407;The discussion I had with the other Warriors of the Rising Sun could certainly have gone better, but unlike some of those present I did not make a fool out of myself by showing that I was completely ignorant of the subject we were discussing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3407;I suppose that went okay...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3408;I did very poorly during the discussing with the other Warriors of the Rising Sun, and I also did not learn anything of note. It is clear that several of those present respect me and my opinion a lot less now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3408;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3409;I did very poorly during the discussing with the other Warriors of the Rising Sun, and I also did not learn anything of note. It is clear that several of those present respect me and my opinion a lot less now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3409;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3410;Some other Warriors of the Rising Sun have offered me the opportunity to spar with them. It is possible this will help me become a better warrior, though of course there is also a risk of injury if things go poorly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3410;I'll participate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3410;I have better things to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3411;The sparring session went very well, and I learned several useful things from the others that were present. I expect I will do better as a warrior in the future as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3411;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3412;Though I did not learn anything noteworthy during the sparring session the other Warriors of the Rising Sun that were present spoke highly of my skills and told me they appreciated my presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3412;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3413;Though I did not learn anything noteworthy during the sparring session the other Warriors of the Rising Sun that were present spoke highly of my skills and told me they appreciated my presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3413;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3414;While I did not make a complete fool of myself while sparring with the other Warriors of the Rising Sun I also did not perform quite as well as some of the others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3414;I suppose it could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3415;Things did not go well during the sparring session with the other Warriors of the Rising Sun as I made a mistake that resulted in me being injured by my sparring partner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3415;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3416;Though I managed to avoid injuring myself while sparring with some other Warriors of the Rising Sun I did not impress anyone with my skills, and some of those present even seemed quite disappointed by my performance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3416;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3417;Though I managed to avoid injuring myself while sparring with some other Warriors of the Rising Sun I did not impress anyone with my skills, and some of those present even seemed quite disappointed by my performance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3417;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3418;The sparring session went extremely poorly for me, and I managed to get badly injured. I would have liked to blame someone else for my injury, but the truth is that it was all my fault.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3418;I shouldn't have done this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
