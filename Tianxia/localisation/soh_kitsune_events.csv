EVTDESC_SOH_4301;One day when I am returning home just after dusk a young woman I have never seen before approaches me. She introduces herself as [new_kitsune_or_not.GetBestName] and humbly asks whether I could arrange for a place for her to stay as she expects to be in the area for a while and her previous arrangements have fallen apart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4301;I can find a place for you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4301;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4303;[From.GetBestName] has been staying at my court for a while now, and so far I have found her to be quite fascinating. She is also quite beautiful, and I cannot help but get the feeling that she might be interested in getting to know me quite a bit more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4303;I will approach her about it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4303;It would be inappropriate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4304;It seems [FromFrom.GetBestName] was not as interested in me as I had though. As soon as I made my suggestion she backs away from me, telling me to stay away from her. Within the hour I was informed that she was seen storming out the front gate, carrying all of her possessions with her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4304;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4305;[FromFrom.GetBestName] turns out to be quite receptive to my suggestion, and it seems she knows the layout of my residence nearly as well as I do as she easily found a secluded spot for the two of us to engage in lovemaking. Eventually, as I am getting dressed, she tells me that she can't wait for the next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4305;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4306;[FromFrom.GetBestName] turns out to be quite receptive to my suggestion, and it seems she knows the layout of my residence nearly as well as I do as she easily found a secluded spot for the two of us to engage in lovemaking. Much later, as I am getting dressed, I start to consider the future of our relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4306;This is all I want!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4306;I will make her a concubine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4306;I will marry her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4307;[From.GetBestName] and I have been getting closer and closer with each passing day. We might not have known each other very well at the start of our relationship, but now I am certain both of us have come to know and care about one another quite a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4307;This is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4309;One day as I am dealing with several routine tasks one of my servants brings me a sealed message bearing an unfamiliar seal. Opening it, I discover that it is a letter from  [FromFrom.GetBestName], informing me that she has left my court looking for other opportunities elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4309;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4311;[From.GetBestName] has been staying at my court for quite some time now, and I have long known that she has taken an interest in her surrounding. Today she approached me with a suggestion regarding some adjustments to the guards' patrol routes that she apparently thinks would make the place much more secure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4311;What a great idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4311;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4312;A few days after the guards have adjusted their patrol routes as suggested a servant comes running, informing me me that someone has broken into my treasury. A substantial amount of money appears to be missing, and it seems [FromFrom.GetBestName] also is nowhere to be found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4312;She fooled us all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4313;A few days after the guards have adjusted their patrol routes as suggested a servant comes running, informing me that the guards caught a thief about to break into my treasury. It seems the new patrol routes already have paid off, and that I owe [FromFrom.GetBestName] my thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4313;She truly is most helpful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4314;One day as I am dealing with several routine tasks one of my servants brings me a sealed message bearing an unfamiliar seal. Opening it, I discover that it is a letter from  [FromFrom.GetBestName], informing me that she has left my court looking for other opportunities elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4314;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4316;One day I return to my quarters to find a horrifying sight inside. [From.GetBestName] is standing there, drenched in blood and looking down at the unmoving bodies of several people close to me. Hearing me enter, she turns around and gives me a crazed smile, telling me that now nobody will keep us apart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4316;Guards! Bring me her head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4316;Guards! Toss her in the dungeon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4316;Guards! Leave me and my love!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4317;[From.GetBestName] has asked me to meet her and several others to discuss a matter of mutual interest, and as I have no other plans I have decided to humor the request. As soon as the last person arrives, [From.GetBestName] gets up from her seat and locks the door, and then she turns around, pulling free a dagger and giving us all a crazed smile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4317;No! Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4318;One day one of the servants comes running, informing me that [kitsune_rival.GetBestName] and [From.GetBestName] are having an argument. I head over to see if I can salvage the situation, but it quickly becomes clear that that is not going to be possible as they truly seem to dislike one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4318;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4319;I came across [FromFrom.GetBestName] one day when returning from a meeting with [From.GetBestName]. I inquired about her day, wishing to be polite, but for some reason she took it poorly and accused me of always treating her poorly. The situation quickly got worse from there, and soon we were both shouting at each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4319;I hate you too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4321;[From.GetBestName] asks to speak to me one day, telling me that while she is fond of me she has been considering matters of religion recently, and she has realized that she would prefer to take monastic vows and enter into the service of the Buddha.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4321;If that is your wish...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4321;I forbid it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4322;Though [FromFrom.GetBestName] has not brought up the matter of taking monastic vows again she has become rather distant, and though I remain fond of her it seems that she no longer feels the same way about me. Perhaps that will change in the future, but I feel anything but certain about that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4322;I think she might be mad at me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4323;The day after my conversation with [From.GetBestName] I discovered a sealed envelope addressed to me in my bedroom, clearly written in her handwriting. I opened it to discover that it was a note informing me that she has seen fit to head elsewhere in search of enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4323;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4324;Ever since I first came to know her, [From.GetBestName] has been known to get sick on almost a weekly basis. It has usually not been anything particularly serious, but every now and them she has had trouble recovering, and I just received word that she seems to be struggling with an illness once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4324;She really doesn't have it easy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4328;As I grow older my kitsune powers continue to grow, bit by bit. Usually, it is not really something I pay attention to, but as I woke up with a new tail this morning I am confident that my power just grew significantly. The humans surrounding me are unlikely to notice anything, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4328;They never do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4329;I have often heard humans speak of improving themselves, of changing who they are, whether in the name of spirituality, of glory, or of vanity. At times, I have found this appealing myself, but as I am not human there is only so much I can change about myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4329;I can't fight my nature!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4330;While it can be fun to play with the emotions of several humans at the same time I feel that doing so has resulted in me being overly lax when it comes to keeping [kitsune_target.GetBestName] wrapped around my finger, and I have resolved to focus my efforts on addressing that matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4330;I need to focus...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4331;A message arrived from [From.GetBestName] today, informing me that she no longer feels quite the same way about me as she once did. Perhaps she will change her mind in the future, but it seems that she wishes to keep me at a distance for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4331;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4332;[kitsune_target.GetBestName] and I have been at odds for some time, but as [kitsune_target.GetSheHe] is someone it is rather useful for me to keep close that is not really ideal, and I feel that it is time for our rivalry to end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4332;Time to end that nonsense...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4333;Though I and [From.GetBestName] have been at odds for some time I have always been somewhat fond of her, and today she approached me with a suggestion that we should put the past behind us. I cannot recall quite what her arguments were, but they were quite convincing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4333;It was just a misunderstanding!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4334;[kitsune_target.GetBestName] and I have been drifting apart lately, and though I am confident that I could find other humans to wrap around my finger there is something special about [kitsune_target.GetBestName] that makes me want to keep [kitsune_target.GetHerHis] attentions focused on me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4334;Time to turn on the charm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4335;[From.GetBestName] and I have been drifting apart lately as I had the feeling that she no longer was interested in me, but today she made certain to remind me just how much she cares about me, and my feelings for her certainly have not diminished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4335;I love her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4336;Though it is usually not terribly difficult for me to keep the attention of [kitsune_target.GetBestName] focused on me seeing as I have my kitsune powers available [kitsune_rival.GetBestName] has been getting in the way of my plans quite a bit, and I am starting to wonder if [kitsune_rival.GetSheHe] should be taken care of permanently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4336;Accidents happen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4336;...but not this time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4337;As I am about to fall asleep one evening I hear the sound of movement nearby and a knock on my door. I get out of bed and hurry to the door to open it, finding [From.GetBestName] outside. I can see a foxlike tail sticking out behind her, which I barely have time to take in as she lunges at me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4337;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4338;I have just received word that [kitsune_rival.GetBestName] has been found dead in her quarters, killed by an unknown attacker. Word appears to spread quickly about the murder, as [From.GetBestName] comes to see me before long, telling me that she worries that someone might come after her next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4338;I will keep you safe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4339;Though me attention currently is focused on [kitsune_target.GetBestName] I know the value of ensuring that others respect me and appreciate my presence. Lately, I have been having quite a few interactions with [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName], and [kitsune_courtier.GetSheHe] truly seems to have enjoyed my company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4339;I am good at this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4340;I have been spending some time in the company of [From.GetBestName] lately, and she truly is a fascinating woman, easily able to converse with me and others on a multitude of different subjects and always someone that can put a smile on anyone's face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4340;She's quite impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4341;I have noticed that [From.GetBestName] has been spending a lot of time in the company of [FromFrom.GetBestName] lately, and it seems [From.GetBestName] has found it quite enjoyable as [From.GetSheHe] has been heard praising [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s ability to provide entertaining conversation and good company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4341;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4342;Though my attention currently is focused on [kitsune_target.GetBestName] I know the value of ensuring that others respect me and appreciate my presence. Unfotunately, [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName] does not seem all that appreciative of my presence, and [kitsune_courtier.GetSheHe] might even suspect what I truly am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4342;I should have been more careful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4343;I have been spending some time in the company of [From.GetBestName] lately, and though she is a fascinating woman in many ways there is something about her that is just not quite right. I have not been able to put my finger on just what that is, but I probably should speak to [kitsune_target.GetBestName] about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4343;I must tell [kitsune_target.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4343;I'm not sure what I saw...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4344;I have noticed that [From.GetBestName] has been spending a lot of time in the company of [FromFrom.GetBestName] lately, and I had expected this to mean that they both enjoyed each other's company. However, it seems [From.GetBestName] thinks that [FromFrom.GetBestName] is not quite what she seems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4344;I don't believe [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4344;I will investigate this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4345;Though my warning about [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] has reached [From.GetBestName] [From.GetSheHe] has apparently decided that I must be imagining things, seeing as I have just received a letter telling me to not make such baseless accusations against [FromFromFrom.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4345;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4346;It seems [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName] suspects more than I would have expected and that [kitsune_courtier.GetSheHe] has seen fit to share what [kitsune_courtier.GetSheHe] suspects with [From.GetBestName], seeing as [From.GetSheHe] just confronted me about the accusations that I am not quite what I seem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4346;Time to end the charade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4346;Time to charm [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4347;I am able to locate [From.GetBestName] easily enough and quickly convince her to speak to me alone. When I reveal the accusations made by [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName], [From.GetBestName] lets out an annoyed sigh and transforms into a many-tailed fox before running off into the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4347;It's all true!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4348;I have just received word from [From.GetBestName] that [From.GetSheHe] confronted [FromFrom.GetBestName] about her unusual behaviour and that it turns out that something unusual indeed was going on, seeing as [FromFrom.GetBestName] apparently transformed into a many-tailed fox before running off into the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4348;I knew it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4349;It does not take much more than a few words, a quick touch, and the merest fraction of my kitsune powers to convince [FromFrom.GetBestName] that the accusations made against me by [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName] do not hold up to scrutiny, and that I most definitely am an ordinary human woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4349;Child's play!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4350;[From.GetBestName] is clearly surprised by the accusations that [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName] has made against her, telling me that she had thought that the two of them were friends. After considering the matter for a moment, she suggests that [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName] feels threatened by a beautiful and brillant woman such as herself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4350;She's right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4351;I have just received word from [From.GetBestName] that [From.GetSheHe] has spoken to [FromFrom.GetBestName] and that there is no reason for me to be suspicious of her. Moreover, [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] seem to think that I feel threatened by the fact that [FromFrom.GetBestName] is a beautiful and brillant woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4351;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4352;I had expected a few words, a quick touch, and the merest fraction of my kitsune powers to be enough to convince [FromFrom.GetBestName] that the accusations made against me by [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName] do not hold up to scrutiny, but [FromFrom.GetSheHe] seems unaffected by my attempt to convince [From.GetHerHim] and demands answers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4352;I tire of this game!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4353;[From.GetBestName] initially claims surprised by the accusations that [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName] has made against her, but after I refuse to drop the matter she lets out an annoyed sigh and transforms into a many-tailed fox before running off into the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4353;It's all true!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4354;I have just received word from [From.GetBestName] that [From.GetSheHe] confronted [FromFrom.GetBestName] about her unusual behaviour and that it turns out that something unusual was going on, seeing as [FromFrom.GetBestName] transformed into a many-tailed fox before running off into the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4354;I knew it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4355;I have known [From.GetBestName] for many years, and yet I am convinced that she looks very much the same as when I first met her, even though that seems impossible. Maybe she is using some kind of cosmetics I am unfamiliar with, or it is a trick of the light, but it might also be something rather less mundane.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4355;I'm imagining things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4355;I need to ask her...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4356;One of the disadvantages with staying in the same place for as long as I have is that people might start to notice that everything about me is not as it seems, and [From.GetBestName] has just confronted me about the fact that I do not seem to age at quite the same rate as anyone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4356;Time to end the charade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4356;Time to charm [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4357;I confront [From.GetBestName] about her unchanging appearance, and to my surprise she does not bother to attempt to defend herself. Instead, she lets out an annoyed sigh and turns into a many-tailed fox, running off into the distance before I can react to what just happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4357;I should have known!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4358;It does not take much more than a few words, a quick touch, and the merest fraction of my kitsune powers to convince [FromFrom.GetBestName] that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is imagining things, and [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is quick to apologize, telling me that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] clearly is mistaken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4358;Child's play!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4359;[From.GetBestName] is clearly surprised when I ask her about her unchanging appearance and is quick to point out that there are others around that have changed very little over the years as well. I consider her words and become more and more convinced that everything is as it should be and that nothing strange is going on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4359;I trust her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4360;I had expected a few words, a quick touch, and the merest fraction of my kitsune powers to be enough to convince [FromFrom.GetBestName] that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is imagining things, but [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is not so easily dissuaded, and it has become clear that I really have been staying in one place for far too long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4360;This ends now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4361;[From.GetBestName] seems surprised when I ask her about her unchanging appearance, but when I refuse to drop the matter until she presents an explanation she lets out an annoyed sigh and transforms into a many-tailed fox. I am so surprised by this that I do not notice that she has taken off running until she is far away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4361;I did not expect that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4362;There are many games kitsunes can play with humans, and some of them might seem a bit cruel. However, they all serve one purpose or another, and though it would be hard to give anyone an explanation I have started to consider whether [kitsune_target.GetBestName] should suffer a bout of illness just about now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4362;I have my needs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4362;...but I don't need this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4363;When I woke up in the morning I felt ready to take on the world, but over the course of the day I have become unwell, seemingly for no good reason. [From.GetBestName] has noticed this, and she has promised to do everything she can to help me recover as quickly as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4363;I'm glad she's here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4364;[kitsune_lesson_target.GetBestName] is growing up fast, and [kitsune_lesson_target.GetSheHe] probably does not suspect my true nature or the fact that it might result in trouble for [kitsune_lesson_target.GetHerHim] in the future. To help [kitsune_lesson_target.GetHerHim] survive, I have decided to give [kitsune_lesson_target.GetHerHim] a few lessons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4364;Mother knows best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4365;My mother, [From.GetBestName], took me on a trip into the forest today. Once there, she told me that she wanted to teach me a lesson to prepare me for the future, as there are those in the world that might resent me simply because I am her child. The lesson was a bit odd, but I had fun, and I learned some things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4365;Mother knows best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4366;Though I spend a lot of my time in the company of [kitsune_target.GetBestName] and others I occasionally find the opportunity to slip away for a few hours to visit the forest nearby, and particularly the foxes found in it. One day when I am enjoying their company a servant comes to find me, and she notices the foxes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4366;I was just taking a walk!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4367;Today one of my servants requested a moment of time to speak to me about [From.GetBestName]. Surprised by this request, I saw fit to grant it, and it turns out that the servant saw [From.GetBestName] spending time with a group of foxes in the forest earlier in the day and thought I would want to hear about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4367;Strange, but harmless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4368;One of the many powers I have as a kitsune is the power to enter the dreams of unsuspecting humans. This night, I decided to enter the dreams of [kitsune_dream_target.GetBestName], purely out of curiosity. I did not discover anything of interest, but I had the chance to affect what was happening a little, which was fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4368;That was time well spent...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4369;I do not tend to pay a lot of attention to my dreams, particularly not as I do not remember too many of them, but this night I had some very strange dreams involving various people I know, including [From.GetBestName], whose presence was significantly more pronounced than that of many others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4369;Such odd dreams...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4370;Though there are many reasons to seduce humans, including mere fun and the possibility of ensuring offspring, it is also a good way for a kitsune to replenish some of her magical energy, and today I made sure to drag [kitsune_target.GetBestName] into a secluded area for that purpose, keeping [kitsune_target.GetHerHim] there for hours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4370;I needed that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4371;[From.GetBestName] tends to be quite eager to make love to me, but I rarely find her as eager as she was today. She was quite insistent that I come with her into a secluded area where we would not be bothered, and once she had managed to get me where she wanted me she made sure to keep me there for several hours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4371;That was... exhausting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4372;Though my power is not inconsiderable there are those that seem all but unaffected by them. One such person is [kitsune_priest.GetBestName], who visited [kitsune_target.GetBestName] today to discuss matters of religion, and though I did my best to avoid [kitsune_priest.GetBestName] [kitsune_priest.GetSheHe] seemed quite suspicious of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4372;[kitsune_priest.GetSheHeCap] might know too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4373;[kitsune_priest.GetBestName] visited me today to discuss various matters of faith, which took up a considerable part of my day. After [kitsune_priest.GetSheHe] had left, [From.GetBestName] came to see me, saying that she would prefer if [kitsune_priest.GetSheHe] did not visit again as she finds [kitsune_priest.GetHerHim] quite disagreeable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4373;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4374;[kitsune_priest.GetBestName] seems to be suspecting that I am not quite human, as some of the people I have convinced to watch [kitsune_priest.GetHerHim] have reported that [kitsune_priest.GetSheHe] has been looking into mythological creatures lately and often has been heard muttering my name while doing so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4374;It's time for [kitsune_priest.GetHerHim] to die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4375;Word reached me today that [kitsune_priest.GetBestName] has been found dead and that many books about mythological beasts that were known to have been in [kitsune_priest.GetHerHis] possession have gone missing. [From.GetBestName] seems quite interested in the matter, and has instructed those investigating the murder to keep her informed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4375;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4376;It is somewhat embarrassing for me to have been imprisoned in the first place, but today I finally put my escape plan in motion. My kitsune powers were more than sufficient for the task, and it is unlikely that anyone will be able to figure out just how I escaped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4376;Free at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4377;As I am dealing with various routine matters one of my guards comes running and requests to speak with me, clearly distraught. I grant the request and learn that [From.GetBestName], formerly my prisoner, seems to have vanished without a trace, and that no one has been able to figure out how she got out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4377;I need better guards, it seems...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4378;Today [From.GetBestName] returned unexpectedly, having escaped captivity. She claims to have escaped because of the lax security measures put into place to keep her locked up, and knowing that guards often are not as eager to carry out their jobs as one would expect that could certainly be true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4378;I don't need the details...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4380_KITSUNE_MOTHER;Growing up, I have heard many people tell me that they always have considered my mother a rather strange woman. Some of the things they have told me have seemed strange indeed, and as I woke up today and discovered that I somehow had grown a fox tail overnight I have come to realize that your mother is not exactly human.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4380_KITSUNE_ANCESTOR;Today I woke up and discovered that I somehow had grown a fox tail overnight. I am fairly certain my mother is not a kitsune, but there has to be one among my ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4380;This explains so much!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
