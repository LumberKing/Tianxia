EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_102;The Knight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_102;One day on the road an armored man comes riding towards my party, moving slowly and openly in a manner that is clearly meant to indicate that he does not wish us any harm.\n\n"I am [new_dragonslayer.GetBestName]," he proclaims. "I have been told that you seek the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, and would stand by your side as you face this foe, my [Root.GetLordLady]!"\n\nAs the leader of the party, it is clear to everyone that the decision as to whether to accept the offer is mine to make..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TIANXIA_103;As we are breaking camp one day an armed woman approaches the encampment, moving with purpose but making certain that I and my companions can see her coming.\n\n"My [Root.GetLordLady], I have heard rumours that you plan to face Fredak, the Emperor of Embers," she tells us when she has come closer. "If you would let me accompany you, it would be an honor to fight by your side!"\n\nAs the leader of the party, it is clear to everyone that the decision as to whether to accept the offer is mine to make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TIANXIA_104;One evening while I and my companions are having a meal in a tavern an enormous man clad in ornate armor, though strangely enough lacking a helmet, enters through the door. He spots my party and heads over to us.\n\n"I hear you seek the dragon," he says excitedly. "Allow me to join you, and I would fight by your side so that we might live with honor, or die with glory!" It almost sounds like the latter excites him more than the former.\n\nAs the leader of the party, it is clear to everyone that the decision as to whether to accept the offer is mine to make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_104;I like the way you think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TIANXIA_105;As my party leaves the inn where we have been sleeping one morning we approached by two people, one of them a very large old man with but a single eye, the other a young and fairly muscular woman who looks tiny in comparison.\n\n"We would join your quest, if you would have us," the man says. "I would be your shield!"\n\n"And I would do my best to keep you all safe," the woman adds.\n\nAs the leader of the party, it is clear to everyone that the decision as to whether to accept the offer is mine to make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

"If you promise you will not be asking me to carry your burdens, I would gladly join you."\n\nAs the leader of the party, it is clear to everyone that the decision as to whether to accept the offer is mine to make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
