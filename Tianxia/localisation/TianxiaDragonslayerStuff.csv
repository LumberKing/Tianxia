DRAGONSLAYERS_JOIN_THE_PARTY;[new_dragonslayer.GetBestName] and [new_dragonslayer_2.GetBestName] join your party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_102;The Knight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_102;One day on the road an armored man comes riding towards my party, moving slowly and openly in a manner that is clearly meant to indicate that he does not wish us any harm.\n\n"I am [new_dragonslayer.GetBestName]," he proclaims. "I have been told that you seek the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, and would stand by your side as you face this foe, my [Root.GetLordLady]!"\n\nAs the leader of the party, it is clear to everyone that the decision as to whether to accept the offer is mine to make..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_102;I accept your fealty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_102;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_103;The Knight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_103;As we are breaking camp one day an armed woman approaches the encampment, moving with purpose but making certain that I and my companions can see her coming.\n\n"My [Root.GetLordLady], I have heard rumours that you plan to face Fredak, the Emperor of Embers," she tells us when she has come closer. "If you would let me accompany you, it would be an honor to fight by your side!"\n\nAs the leader of the party, it is clear to everyone that the decision as to whether to accept the offer is mine to make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_103;The honor would be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_103;I don't need you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_104;The Crusader;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_104;One evening while I and my companions are having a meal in a tavern an enormous man clad in ornate armor, though strangely enough lacking a helmet, enters through the door. He spots my party and heads over to us.\n\n"I hear you seek the dragon," he says excitedly. "Allow me to join you, and I would fight by your side so that we might live with honor, or die with glory!" It almost sounds like the latter excites him more than the former.\n\nAs the leader of the party, it is clear to everyone that the decision as to whether to accept the offer is mine to make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_104;I like the way you think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_104;Go away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_105;The Crusader and the Shieldmaiden;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_105;As my party leaves the inn where we have been sleeping one morning we approached by two people, one of them a very large old man with but a single eye, the other a young and fairly muscular woman who looks tiny in comparison.\n\n"We would join your quest, if you would have us," the man says. "I would be your shield!"\n\n"And I would do my best to keep you all safe," the woman adds.\n\nAs the leader of the party, it is clear to everyone that the decision as to whether to accept the offer is mine to make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_105;Two at once? Why not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_105;Your presence is unwanted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_106;The Huntress;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_106;A woman approaches my party one day on the road, wearing light armor and carrying a bow that she seems to be fully capable of using effectively Judging by the look she gives some of my companions, she has seen better warriors in the past.\n\n"I have heard that you are hunting a dragon," she says. "If you promise you will not be asking me to carry your burdens, I would gladly join you."\n\nAs the leader of the party, it is clear to everyone that the decision as to whether to accept the offer is mine to make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_106;No carrying necessary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_106;I don't want you with me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_107;The Goliath;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_107;One evening when I and the others in the party are about to retire one of the guards begs for a moment of my time, quickly bringing over a large and somewhat inebriated man.\n\n"I am [new_dragonslayer.GetName]," the big man says. "I have been waiting...," he pauses to count on his fingers "...three days for you to come here. I want to fight the dragon with you!"\n\nAs the leader of the party, it is clear to everyone that the decision as to whether to accept the offer is mine to make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_107;I could use your strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_107;Please go away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_108;The Zealot;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_108;A rider approaches my party one day on the road, clad in armor bearing a noticeable amount of Christian iconography. The [new_dragonslayer.GetManWoman] brings [new_dragonslayer.GetHerHis] horse to a halt near mine and takes off [new_dragonslayer.GetHerHis] helmet before speaking.\n\n"I am [new_dragonslayer.GetBestName]," the [new_dragonslayer.GetManWoman] proclaims. "In Saint George's name, I would stand with you!"\n\nAs the leader of the party, it is clear to everyone that the decision as to whether to accept the offer is mine to make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_108;I welcome your aid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_108;I don't need a zealot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_109;The Glorious;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_109;As my party is passing through a small market village a handsome man comes up to us, clearly happy to see us as he has a big smile on his face.\n\n"Ah, you have arrived!" he exclaims. "Allow me to introduce myself. I am [new_dragonslayer.GetBestName], and I wish to join you on your quest to the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers. That dreadful beast must be stopped!"\n\nAs the leader of the party, it is clear to everyone that the decision as to whether to accept the offer is mine to make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_109;Your company would be enjoyable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_109;I have no need of you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_110;The Dwarf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_110;In one village along the route we are travelling on our way to the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, my party come across a dwarf, who introduces himself as [new_dragonslayer.GetBestName].\n\n"The dragon killed my kinsmen and stole our treasures," he tells you. "I would join you on your quest to avenge the former and recover the latter."\n\nAs the leader of the party, it is clear to everyone that the decision as to whether to accept the offer is mine to make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_110;You will have your chance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_110;Get lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_111;The Charming;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_111;One day while my party is having a meal by the roadside a handsome man armored in a suit of armor that is very richly decorated rides up to us. Judging by his posture, he thinks rather highly of himself.\n\n"I have heard you wish to slay a dragon," the man tells you, half-speaking and half-singing. "I wish to join you on your quest. Dragonslaying is what I do best!"\n\nAs the leader of the party, it is clear to everyone that the decision as to whether to accept the offer is mine to make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_111;You may accompany me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_111;I don't want your help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_112;The Wyld;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_112;One evening I am approached by a man introducing himself as [new_dragonslayer.GetBestName], who claims that he has heard about my quest.\n\n"Allow me to offer my services," he says. "I am better than the dragon. I have always been far better than the dragon, and I will prove it to him, and to everyone!" Something seems a tad suspect about the man, but I cannot tell what it is.\n\nAs the leader of the party, it is clear to everyone that the decision as to whether to accept the offer is mine to make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_112;Your aid is welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_112;Leave my presence at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_113;The Black Arrow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_113;A man wearing fairly simple clothes and carrying a bow approaches my party one day and introduces himself as [new_dragonslayer.GetBestName], with the epithet being rather unusual for a peasant.\n\n"A little bird told me that you are hunting Fredak, the Emperor of Embers," he says. "I agree that the beast must be slain, and I would join you if you wuld have me. I know how to handle myself in a fight."\n\nAs the leader of the party, it is clear to everyone that the decision as to whether to accept the offer is mine to make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_113;Peasant or no, you can come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_113;I don't associate with peasants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_114;The Blade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_114;As I am negotiating with an innkeeper regarding rooms for the night one of my companions lets slip that we are in the area because we are on a dragon hunt, which catches the woman's interest.\n\n"I have... an interest in dragon hunting, you know," she says. "The rooms are on the house. Moreover, if you would have me, I would gladly join you on your quest."\n\nAs the leader of the party, it is clear to everyone that the decision as to whether to accept the offer is mine to make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_114;You look like you can use that sword!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_114;There is no place for you in my party!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_115;The White Lotus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_115;One day while I am having a meal at a tavern a kindly old man requests to share a cup of tea with me, and I accept his request. Introducing himself as [new_dragonslayer.GetBestName], he inquires about what brings me to the area, and I tell him about my quest.\n\n"I might know a thing or two about dragonslaying," he says. "Can I join you on your quest?\n\nAs the leader of the party, it is clear to everyone that the decision as to whether to accept the offer is mine to make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_115;Your company would be welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_115;Go away, old man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hunt_down_dragon_desc;Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, must be slain. Though it doubtlessly will be a difficult battle, someone has to deal with the problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_203;I have finished the necessary preparations for my planned dragon hunt. Doubtlessly the journey will be long, and possibly fraught with danger, but it is time to set off. Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, must be defeated! Additionally, as some of my companions have pointed out, there should be plenty of riches to be found...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_203;I will slay this dragon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_203;I've changed my mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_205;I have just learned that another would-be dragonslayer, [rival_dragonslayer.GetBestName], is camped nearby. It is doubtful that [rival_dragonslayer.GetSheHe] would be willing to share the glory and riches to be found at Fredak's lair, so perhaps making sure [rival_dragonslayer.GetSheHe] no longer is a concern might be a good idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_205;I will challenge them to a duel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_205;I will strike during the night!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TIANXIA_205;Let's just try to get ahead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_206;As my party is settling down for the night a party led by [From.GetBestName] comes riding around an outcropping. [From.GetSheHeCap] makes it clear in no uncertain terms that [From.GetSheHe] also is hunting Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, and that [From.GetSheHe] will not suffer my interference, suggesting that we settle the matter in a duel to the death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_206;A challenge? I accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_206;I'm getting out of here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_207;I and my party decide that discretion is the better part of valor and run away from [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s party. Though they attempt to pursue us we are able to escape them. However, when we finally make camp in what we believe is a safe location I discover that I have left my [lost_artifact.GetName] behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_207;That's not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_208;Upon hearing my challenge [From.GetBestName] and [From.GetHerHis] party runs away, and though I and my companions give chase we are unable to catch them. Returning to their old campsite, we discover that they left several of their belongings behind, including [lost_artifact.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_208;This might be useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_209;Deciding that discretion is the better part of valor, I and my party flee from the party of [FromFrom.GetBestName]. The enemy gives chase, but eventually we manage to slip away into the night, and though we were forced to leave some of our belongings behind we still managed to bring nearly everything of value.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_209;Let's hope they don't find us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_210;The challenge I issue to [From.GetBestName] has barely left my lips before [From.GetSheHe] and [From.GetHerHis] companions are running away. I and my party chase after them, hoping to force them to stand and fight, but they manage to slip out of our grasp. Investigating the abandoned campsite, my party does not find anything of value.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_210;[From.GetSheHeCap] would flee the dragon too...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_212;I fall asleep early in the evening and wake up in the middle of the night, seeing a cloaked figure standing above me. Before I can make a move the figure pulls a knife and slashes it across my throat. Nearby, I can hear the sound of my companions likewise having their throats slit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_212;Not... like... this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_213;I and my companions wait for [From.GetBestName]'s party to fall asleep for the night, expecting them to set at least one guard. However, they do not see fit to do so, and it thus is a simple matter for us to sneak in and cut their throats while they sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_213;Got you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_214;I fall asleep early in the evening and wake up in the middle of the night. [From.GetBestName] is standing over you with a knife in [From.GetHerHis] hand, evidently planning to use it on me. However, having noticed them before it is too late, I merely take a non-fatal wound as I move to defend myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_214;You'll pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_215;I and my companions successfully approach [From.GetBestName]'s campsite and I make my way towards [From.GetHerHis] sleeping form. However, it seems my approach was noticed at the last moment as [From.GetSheHe] wakes up before I can strike, and though I manage to wound [From.GetHerHim] [From.GetSheHe] is still going to fight back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_215;You are already dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_216;I wake up in the middle of the night hearing the sound of movement nearby. Looking around while doing my best to be as still as possible I see [From.GetBestName] and several other strangers moving around the campsite, doubtlessly with ill intentions in mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_216;To arms! To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_217;MY party manages to approach [From.GetBestName]'s campsite without being detected, but as we move closer to [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetHerHis] companions we fail to be as stealthy as we would have preferred, and they all wake up. It seems we will have a proper fight on our hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_217;Strike them down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_218;I and my companions notice some movement nearby as we making our camp for the night. It does not appear to be mere animals, so we decide to feign being asleep while having our weapons at the ready. When [From.GetBestName] and several other strangers move into our encampment we strike first, wounding them before they can attack us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_218;I knew I heard something!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_219;I think that [From.GetBestName] and [From.GetHerHis] companions have fallen asleep and make my move, but apparently it was a trap as they turn out to have their weapons at the ready. Though the surprise attack does not manage to kill anyone, I am wounded, and now my party has a fight on our hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_219;We can still win this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_220;I and my companions notice [From.GetBestName] and several other strangers sneaking around nearby before we make camp for the night. Expecting trouble, we set a trap, and they all fall right into it. Though it takes a while before they stop moving, they do not manage to inflict any wounds on anyone in my party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_220;Just as planned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_221;The approach to the campsite of [From.GetBestName] does not go as planned. My target and [From.GetHerHis] companions are ready, and the ambush they have set catches me and my party off guard. We barely have time to register that we are under attack before we have taken multiple wounds, and I soon find myself bleeding out on the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_221;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_222;A small [Root.Religion.GetName] shrine is located not far from where my dragonslaying party currently is travelling. It would require a small detour to visit it, but perhaps praying for guidance on our quest is a good idea, and we could certainly head to the shrine without any real difficulty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_222;I shall head there and pray!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_222;It isn't worth the detour...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_223;While the shrine is quite small and certainly not as grand as I am used to in [Root.Capital.GetName], it still is a holy place, and I feel at peace there. Once my prayers are done, I fell confident that [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is looking over me and wishes for me to succeed in my quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_223;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is with us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_224;The shrine is rather small and plain, and though the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] there us a bit rude towards me and my companions we are still permitted to pray there. While I do not quite know if my prayers will be answered, it is still more likely now that I have visited the shrine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_224;Time well spent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_225;The shrine is pleasant enough, though I do not feel like spending a lot of time there, so I and my companions say our prayers rather quickly and set off again. Perhaps they will not have any effect, but I suppose it is better than nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_225;I got to relax a bit, at least...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_226;While the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] tending to the shrine is quite welcoming towards me and my party the shrine itself is rather disappointing, and though we say our prayers to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] as planned I feel a bit usure as to whether they will be answered, or even heard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_226;This was a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_227;The shrine my party visits is unattended and clearly has been that way for a long time as only the directions that we were given tell me that we are in the right place. I begin my prayers as planned, but I quickly realize that it is futile, as [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] clear does not care for this place or anyone here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_227;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_228;One evening after arranging for some rooms for me and my party in a village along the road I decide to take a walk around the village. The villagers are certainly welcoming, and one of them, [potential_lover.GetBestName], seem quite interested in me, seeing as [potential_lover.GetSheHe] suggests that the two of you should spend the night together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_228;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_228;Sorry, but no.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_229;I spend an enjoyable night of passion with [potential_lover.GetBestName], and we fall asleep together in my bed once we both are thoroughly exhausted.\n\n"What now, [Root.GetLordLady]'s?" [potential_lover.GetBestName] asks the next morning. "Would you like me at your side, or should I head to your court and await your return from your quest?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_229;You should come with me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_229;Wait for me in my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TIANXIA_229;I don't want to see you again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_230;One day my party comes across a village under attack from a group of bandits. The battle appears as if it could go either way without our intervention, and doubtlessly the villagers would like it if we saw fit to help out. Of course, it would put us in danger, so perhaps we should instead continue on our quest...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_230;We'll help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_230;We'll be leaving now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TIANXIA_230;We'll help... the bandits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_231;We ride into the village and I quickly take command of the defense. The villagers are more skilled at fighting than I would have expected at first glance, and we quickly manage to stabilize the situation and eventually drive the bandits off. Judging by the number of bodies they leave behind they are unlikely to dare to mount another attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_231;Victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_232;We ride into the village and rally the defenders against the bandits. The battle remains undecided for some time, and we take some wounds in the fighting, but eventually we are able to force the bandits away. Hopefully, they will not see fit to return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_232;I've had worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_233;We ride into the village and join the defenders attempting to fight back the bandits. The battle is not as even as I first expected, and by the time that my party and the villagers have driven back the attackers we have taken a number of wounds, several of them major.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_233;'Tis but a scratch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_234;We ride into the village that the bandits are attacking. The villagers think we are there to help, and they helpfully point out where their defense is in urgent need of reinforcements, allowing us to attack those positions from behind. With your aid, the village falls to the bandits in short order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_234;Burn it all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_235;We ride into the village that the bandits are attacking and are quickly sent to join the defenders. Though my party catches some of them by surprise when we turn on them, several of the others fight back, and even though we and the bandits eventually win we take some wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_235;They actually hurt me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_236;We ride into the village that the bandits are attacking and the villagers quickly send us to support the defense. Even though I believe that our sudden and ineviatable betrayal is timed to take them by surprise the villagers fight back, and we take several grievous wounds before the battle is won.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_236;They'll pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_237;We ride into the village that the bandits are attacking. Though I initially think that the villagers have fallen for our ruse it turns out that they are ready when we attempt to betray them, and we quickly find ourselves overwhelmed by them. We make an attempt to surrender to them, but they are not in the mood to show mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_237;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_238;One evening when my party enters the common room of a tavern located in a village on the way to the dragon's lair I notice that an old man is standing near the fireplace, speaking to a group of villagers. It quickly becomes apparent that he is telling them a story about a legendary dragonslayer. Perhaps it might contain some wisdom?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_238;Stay a while and listen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_238;This is a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_239;The story told by the man is quite engaging. Though I suspect that there might be elements of the story that have been embellished over the years and though the old man certainly does not seem to be in any hurry when it comes to getting to the actual dragon fight, when he reaches that part the dragonslayers' tactics actually make a lot of sense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_239;I won't stand in the fire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_240;The old man's story is rather long, and several elements in it are rather fanciful. I keep listening, and eventually he reaches the part about how the legendary dragonslayers fought the dragon in its lair and defeated it. When the man is done I am unconvinced as to the wisdom of their supposed tactics, even though the villagers seem to think them brilliant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_240;Do I really have to avoid its fire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_241;The old mans story contains nearly everything - good and evil, stars falling from the heavens, lovers cruelly separated, pirates and shadowy assassins, and many more things besides - and it takes him quite a while to reach the end. However, by the time he gets there, it turns out that it is missing anything at all resembling dragonslaying advice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_241;Well, that was unhelpful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_242;The story told by the old man is very long, and quite questionable, but I keep listening in the hopes that the part where the dragonslayers actually face off against the dragon will contain something helpful. Unfortunately, that is not the case, as the dragonslayers prevail despite making several highly questionable decisions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_242;Why would you stand in the fire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_243;The story told by the old man is quite engaging, and it contains a surprising amount of wisdom. Though some of the villagers give up partway through, I am enthralled. By the time that the man is finished I have started to formulate what I am convinced will be a very effective strategy against Fredak, the Emperor of Embers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_243;I should stand in the fire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_244;For one reason or another [disagreement_target.GetBestName] seems to have become less happy with me during the course of our journey to the dragon's lair. One day, a truly innocent comment I make set [disagreement_target.GetHerHim] off, and [disagreement_target.GetSheHe] angrily proclaims that I am only on this quest due to my supposed vanity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_244;Luckily I knew just what to day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_244;I think I can fix this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TIANXIA_244;[disagreement_target.GetSheHeCap] has crossed the line this time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_245;Despite [disagreement_target.GetBestName] being quite unhappy I manage to turn the situation around in short order. While we might perhaps not be quite as happy with one another's company as we were before, I am confident that the two of us will still be able to fight side by side with the knowledge that we can rely upon one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_245;It was just a minor disagreement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_246;My words do not seem to calm [disagreement_target.GetBestName] down completely, but though I feel that our relationship will be a bit strained in the days to come the argument is at least over for the moment. Hopefully, this will not cause any further problems, as we certainly could do without them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_246;Could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_247;My attempt to make things better has the opposite effect of what I intended, and soon I and [disagreement_target.GetBestName] are shouting at one another. Though we eventually lower our voices and continue on our way, I do not feel that I can put the argument behind me. With friends like these, who needs enemies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_247;I almost wish [From.GetSheHe] had left!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_248;U have been travelling with [friendship_target.GetBestName] for a while now, and we have both come to enjoy each other's company. Of all the people I could have at my side when I face Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, I can hardly think of anyone better, or at least not anyone I could rely upon to the same extent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_248;Best friends forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_249;Over the course of my journey with [lover_target.GetBestName] we have become much closer, and I cannot deny that [lover_target.GetSheHe] certainly is a good-looking [lover_target.GetManWoman]. Perhaps the attraction is mutual, and in that case the two of us certainly would be able to spend quite a few nights together while we are on the road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_249;It wouldn't hurt to ask...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_249;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_250;I and [From.GetBestName] have grown rather close during our journey together, and I have to admit that [From.GetSheHe] is rather fetching. It does not really surprise me when [From.GetSheHe] suggests that the two of us should spend the night together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_250;Your tent, or mine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_250;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_251;To my delight [From.GetBestName] is receptive to my advances and we spend a very enjoyable night together. When morning comes and the two of us wake up I know that I have to make a decision as to whether we should go back to the way things were before or if we should continue spending the night together in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_251;We should do this again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_251;This won't continue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_252;I and [From.GetBestName] spend the night together, and it is certainly an enjoyable time. When morning comes it is clear that both of us wish for this to continue, at least for the foreseeable future. It will perhaps not give us any real advantage once we face Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, but the journey should certainly be more enjoyable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_252;This must be love!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_253;While I and [From.GetBestName] spend what I would consider a very enjoyable night together it does not seem that [From.GetSheHe] is interested in making a habit out of it. I am certainly not told this in a cruel way, but it is still presented in a manner that makes it abundantly clear that [From.GetBestName] has made up [From.GetHerHis] mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_253;Perhaps it is for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_254;It appears that the attraction I feel towards [From.GetBestName] is not mutual. At the very least, [From.GetSheHe] rather firmly tells me that [From.GetSheHe] has no interest in spending the night with me, and suggests that I drop the matter and that the two of us continue as if I never had seen fit to ask.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_254;Fine! Be that way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_255;Power at a Price;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_255_A;I wake up in the middle of the night, noticing a chill in the air. A beautiful, if somewhat strange, woman with a severe expression on her face is standing over me.\n\n"You are a brave [Root.GetManWoman]," she says. "Few would dare seek the lair of a being as powerful as Fredak, the Emperor of Embers. As things currently stand, you might not prevail, but that can change." She gives me a thin smile.\n\n"I can give you the power to defeat your foe. All I want in return is a year of your memories. You will hardly notice that they are gone. What say you?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

"Few would dare seek the lair of a being as powerful as Fredak, the Emperor of Embers. As things currently stand, you might not prevail, but that can change."

EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_255;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_255;I will pay your price!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TIANXIA_255;Taste my steel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DRAW_STEEL;I will draw my sword to attack the strange woman;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_256_A;A few nights later I wake up to find the same woman standing above me again, seemingly unconcerned about the chill in the air.\n\n"Again I will offer," she says, her expression unreadable. "Power for you to use to defeat Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, at the end of your quest, in exchange for a year of your memories. What say you?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_256_B;A few nights later I wake up to find the same woman standing above me again, seemingly unconcerned about the chill in the air.\n\n"Again I will offer," she says, her expression unreadable.

EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_256;Still not interested!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_256;On second thought, I accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TIANXIA_256;Get out! Get out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_257_A;I am not particularly surprised when I open my eyes and see the same strangely beautiful woman standing above me once again a few nights later, still not showing any discomfort in the cold.\n\n"Thrice I offer and done," she tells me. "A gift of some of my power, so that you may defeat Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, for a year of your memories. What say you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_257_B;I am not particularly surprised when I open my eyes and see the same strangely beautiful woman standing above me once again a few nights later, still not showing any discomfort in the cold.\n\n"Thrice I offer and done," she tells me.

EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_257;And thrice I refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_257;I accept your bargain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TIANXIA_257;I have had enough of you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_258;"Your bravery is admirable, [Root.GetBestName], and you have treated fairly," the woman says, giving me a small nod. "I shall take my leave, and not return. It is unfortunate that we could not make a bargain, but I wish you luck in your endeavour. Fare thee well."\n\nWith that, she vanishes without a trace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_258;What a strange woman...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_259;"Done," the woman says. "Done. And done."\n\nI feel some of the cold around me shift and move into my body, and I know without a doubt that I have received the power I bargained for. Moreover, I know that the price has been paid.\n\n"Fare thee well, [Root.GetBestName]," the woman says, vanishing without a trace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_259;I hope it was worth it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_260;The already cold air becomes truly freezing as the first inch of my blade clears the scabbard, and I find myself unable to move.\n\n"You seek to draw steel against me?" the woman asks furiously. "A curse upon you and your quest, for all eternity!" With that, she vanishes as if she had never been there, though the chill lingers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_260;I feel... strange...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_261;One day on the road I and my companions come across the ruins of a village. We search for survivours and find a few badly burned individuals on the cusp of death. Before they die they tell us that Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, attacked them and that nothing they did seemed to as much as slightly inconvenience the gargantuan red dragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_261;Proof I must continue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_261;Proof this is a fool's errand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
RETURN_HOME;I decide to abandon my quest, at least for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_262;One day when I am scouting ahead of my party I come across a small stone tower next to the road just as I am about to return from what turned out to be a detour. It appears to be in rather good condition, which is rather strange this far away from any settlements. Perhaps it is something to investigate before returning to the party?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_262;I will enter the tower!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_262;I should leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_263;I make my way inside the stone tower and take a look around. There are several rooms inside the tower, but all of them are completely empty, and I cannot determine the reason why it was constructed. As I finish my investigation and turn to leave the tower I accidentally step on a small, triangular object that has been left unattended on the floor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_263;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_264;I enter the tower and climb the staircase I find just inside, entering a large room on the next floor. A stone pedestal is located at the centre of the room, upon which a large dodecahedron rests, emitting a dull grey glow. I also notice a hooded figure standing near the pedestal.\n\n"Leave this place!" the figure tells me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_264;I mean no harm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_264;Step aside or die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TIANXIA_264;I'll just leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_265;The figure seems to consider my words for a moment before shrugging.\n\n"Very well," it says. "You may approach the Beacon. It will not harm you, and neither will I."\n\nStepping up to the pedestal, I carefully reach out to touch the dodecahedron. As I do so, I feel some kind of energy flow into me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_265;I feel empowered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_266;The figure seems to consider my words for a moment before pulling out a sword from somewhere inside its robe.\n\n"You are unworthy of the Beacon's power," it says. "Leave this place now, or I shall compel you by force of arms." Judging by their stance, they know how to use their weapon quite well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_266;You shall not stop me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_266;I'll be on my way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_267;Though it is a difficult fight, I eventually get the upper hand against the hooded figure, and my opponent's sword goes flying from their hand.\n\n"I cannot stop you from claiming the Beacon's power, it seems," the figure says, snapping its fingers and vanishing without a trace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_267;Victory is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_268;I and the figure exchange blows, and eventually I gain the upper hand, driving them back before you.\n\n"It seems I cannot defeat you," the figure notes. "Luckily, I can still prevent you from claiming the Beacon."\n\nIt snaps its fingers, and both it and the dodecahedron vanish without a trace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_268;Well, that was odd...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_269;Though the fight appears to be even to begin with, my opponent soon gain the upper hand, and I take several wounds.\n\n"Be thankful I do not seek to harm you any further," the figure says, snapping its fingers and vanishing without a trace, along with the dodecahedron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_269;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_270;The fight quickly turns against me, and though I manage to avoid taking any fatal injuries I am still grievously wounded.\n\n"Let this be a lesson to you," your opponent says, snapping their fingers and vanishing without a trace, along with the dodecahedron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_270;This did not go as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_271;To call the battle uneven would be a kindness, and before long I find myself bleeding out on the ground.\n\n"You were unworthy, and you have paid the price," the figure tells me. It snaps its fingers and vanishes, along with the dodecahedron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_271;No! No! No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_272;I enter the tower and make my way to the second level, finding myself in a room containing a stone pedestal upon which a dodecahedron emitting a faint grey glow sits. Filled with curiosity, I move up to it and reach out to grasp it. As I do so, I feel a strange power flowing into me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_272;Such possibilities!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_273;[From.GetBestName] is currently on a journey to the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, and is thus relatively unprotected due to only having a small party of travelling companions with [From.GetHerHim]. Perhaps sending an assassin after [From.GetHerHim] at this time would be a wise course of action, as that would rid me of a most troublesome rival...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_273;I know just the woman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_273;That would be a waste of money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_274;I awake in the middle of the night feeling a knife being slashed across across my throat. Blood starts pouring out even before my attacker has vanished into the night. Though I do your best to stop the bleeding, it is ultimately futile, and I can feel my life slipping away, mu quest unfulfilled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_274;Who killed me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_275;I awake in the middle of the night hearing the sound of movement nearby. Looking up, I can see a shrouded woman standing above me, with a knife at the ready.\n\n"[From.GetBestName] sends [From.GetHerHis] regards," she tells me, leaning in and cutting my throat before vanishing into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_275;Avenge me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_276;The assassin I sent after [From.GetBestName] has reported back to me, her mission successfully completed. As I wanted to prevent her from taking my money and running away without carrying out her job, I had promised her an equal amount once her mission was over, but now I find myself wondering if I need her or her services any longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_276;Guards! Rid me of this loose end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_276;Here's your money, as promised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_277;One night I wake up and find a knife-wielding woman inside my tent. She notices that yI am awake and immediately attacks me, inflicting a fairly minor wound, and then exits the tent in a hurry. My companions fail to catch her as she makes her way into the night. I half expect her to return to try to kill me again, but she does not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_277;Who sent her?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_278;The woman I sent to kill [From.GetBestName] has returned, her mission unfinished. She tries to plead her case, noting that she wounded her target and that she had the courtesy to return to me to inform me of what happened instead of leaving me in the dark, but the fact that she failed remains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_278;You have failed me for the last time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_278;Get out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_279;One night as I am about to fall asleep an armed woman I have never seen before enters my tent, immediately moving to attack me. I manage to avoid the worst of the attack and grab my weapon to fight back, successfully inflicting a fatal wound on my attacker, who dies before she can reveal who sent her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_279;Who could be behind this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_280;My spies inform me that the woman I sent to kill [From.GetBestName] was killed in the attempt, but that her target was seen clearly wounded the day after the attack. Given that [From.GetBestName] doubtlessly will be on [From.GetHerHis] guard against further attempts, it would be foolish to send another assassin at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_280;At least she hurt [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_281;One evening when I am making camp an armed woman suddenly appears out of the night, attacking me almost before I can notice her. I take a wound from the first strike, but successfully prevent her from harming me any further, and she is soon bleeding out on the ground.\n\n"[From.GetBestName] said you were good," are her final words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_281;This will not be forgotten!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_282;My spies inform you that the assassin I hired to kill [From.GetBestName] failed to complete her job. She apparently managed to inflict a wound, but any good that caused is insignificant next to the news that she apparently divulged my name before she died, seeing as [From.GetBestName] was heard denouncing me in a nearby village the next day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_282;This was not what I had in mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_283;I awake in the middle of night hearing the sound of fighting outside my tent. Drawing my weapon, I emerge and find my party standing over the body of an unfamiliar armed woman. My companions explain that she was caught sneaking into our encampment, doubtlessly planning to assassinate me, and I see no reason not to believe them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_283;I wonder who sent her...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_284;The spies I had placed in a village near where [From.GetBestName] was travelling have reported back, informing me that my rival's companions were overheard talking about a failed assassination attempt. Based on the description of the attacker, it would seem that the woman I hired has failed to carry out her job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_284;Disappointing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_285;The sound of fighting wakes me from my slumber, and I quickly arm myself and leave my tent. I find my companions standing around a fatally injured woman I have never seen before.\n\n"[From.GetBestName] sent me," the woman says. "I see no reason to keep that secret, now.".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_285;I will remember this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_286;The spies I had following [From.GetBestName]'s party have sent a most troubling report. Not only did the assassin I hired die attempting to carry out her task, she apparently saw fit not to take the secret of my involvement to her grave, as my spies have heard [From.GetBestName]'s guards say as much in their presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_286;I expected better of her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_287;One day when travelling through the wilderness on your my to the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers I stumble across some strange ruins on a hillside. The ruins appear to be quite extensive, and could contain all manner of things. My party is waiting for me further down the road, but they probably would not mind me being late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_287;I'll investigate the ruins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_287;I'll continue on my journey...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_289;As I move deeper into the ruins I come across a stone door with a large number of keyholes. Judging by the fact that there is an arrow-studded corpse on the ground in front of the door that is clutching an ornate key, someone attempted to unlock the door but choose the keyhole... poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_289;I will try a random keyhole;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_289;I will inspect the key;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TIANXIA_289;I can go no further...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_290;I pick up the key and move over to the door, trying to determine if there is anything noteworthy about any of the keyholes, but that does not seem to be the case. Taking a deep breath and preparing myself for the worst, I pick a keyhole at random. To my great delight, the door is easily unlocked and no arrows come flying in my direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_290;Luck is with me, it seems...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_291;I pick up the key and inspect it. It is quite big, rather ornate, and made from some unknown metal. As best I can tell, it is quite ancient. Turning the key over in my hand, I notice some symbols decorating the other side of it, which seem to depict the door and one keyhole in particular. I try this keyhole and successfully unlock the door.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_291;That was straightforward...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_292;I pick up the key and move over to the door, trying to determine if there is anything noteworthy about any of the keyholes, but that does not seem to be the case. Taking a deep breath and preparing myself for the worst, I pick a keyhole at random. Arrows immediately come flying at me, and though I avoid most of them I dare not try again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_292;Time to leave, it seems...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_293;As I am moving deeper into the ruins I notice that the room ahead of me is illumiated by torchlight from the inside. Sneaking up to the doorway, I notice that a number of bandits are located inside the room, arguing with each other about something. They have not noticed me yet, but I will have to fight them if I want to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_293;They will not stop me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_293;I can go no further...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_294;I ready my weapon and enter the room, catching the bandits unaware. Two of them go down without even noticing that I am there, and two more barely have time to draw their weapons before they fall. The remaining two do their best to fight back, but though they last longer than the others they do not even manage to draw blood before they fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_294;Rabble is easily dispersed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_295;I ready my weapon and enter the room, catching the bandits mostly unaware. One of them sees me and gives out a cry before I cut him down, and I manage to strike down another before he can draw his sword. The rest manage to put up a fight, and I take a few wounds before I manage to kill them all. The way forward is open.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_295;They fought well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_296;I ready my weapon and enter the room. The bandits notice me before I manage to get close to any of them, and they draw their weapons and run at me. I take several wounds in quick succession, but remain standing. Though badly wounded by the end, I manage to defeat all of the bandits, but I am too badly injured to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_296;I must leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_297;I ready my weapon and enter the room, and the bandits are ready for my approach, drawing their weapons as soon as I enter. I put up a good fight, all things considered, but even though I manage to inflict several wounds on the bandits I take even more wounds in return. Before long, I fall to the ground, and I cannot get back up again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_297;Nooooooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_298;As I move deeper into the ruins something about the passageway I am moving through fills me with unease. I cannot quite say what it is that makes me feel that way, and perhaps it is nothing at all, but maybe it would be prudent to leave the ruins without delving any deeper, even though that would mean I would never find out what lies inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_298;I will delve deeper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_298;I should leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_299;I keep moving down the passageway, still feeling at unease. As I take another step the stone beneath my foot suddenly moves downwards ever so sligthly. Realizing what is going on, I quickly move backwards, managing to avoid a number of rocks that suddenly drop down from above where I would have been standing if I had continued forward...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_299;A clever trap, but not clever enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_300;I keep moving down the passageway, still feeling at unease. As I take another step the stone beneath my foot suddenly moves downwards ever so sligthly. I take a moment too long to realize what is happening and fail to completely avoid the rocks that fall down from above, but as I avoided the worst of it I feel that I can continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_300;That wasn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_301;I keep moving down the passageway, still feeling at unease. As I take another step the stone beneath my foot suddenly moves downwards ever so sligthly. Before I realize what is happening, a number of rocks fall down on top of me, and though I manage to avoid death I am too injured to be able to continue deeper into the ruins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_301;I need to leave now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_302;I keep moving down the passageway, still feeling at unease. Nothing seems to happen as I move forward, at least not until a number of large rocks fall from the ceiling, landing on top of me. I am grievously injured by the rocks and bleeding very badly, and when I attempt to move the rocks aside I realize that that is not going to be possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_302;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_304;I continue deeper into the ruins and eventually end up in a room with a closed stone door on the other side, next to which there is a chain with a handle. A short distance away from the door there are several columns decorated with symbols, which appear to be possible to rotate. No doubt there is a connection between the symbols and the door.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_304;I will try a random combination;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_304;I will investigate the walls;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TIANXIA_304;I should leave the ruins...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_305;I rotate the pillars at random until I arrive at a combination I like and then move over to the door. Pulling on the handle affixed to the chain next to the door, I am pleasantly surprised when I hear the sound of some kind of locking mechanism inside the door comes unlocked. It is a trivial matter to open the doors and continue onwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_305;Luck is on my side, it seems...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_306;I take a look at the walls of the room and notice that they are mostly bare of decorations. However, there is a trio of symbols high above the stone door, which I can also see on the rotating pillars. It is a simple matter to turn the pillars around until the symbols on them line up with those above the door, and the way forward is easily opened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_306;How simple!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_307;I rotate the pillars at random until I arrive at a combination I like and then move over to the door. When I pull on the handle affixed to the chain next to the door I hear something moving inside the wall, and unfortunately for me it is not a locking mechanism. Several arrows pierce my body, and it would be too risky to try again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_307;I must withdraw...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_308;As I move deeper into the ruins I find the way forward blocked by a number of swinging blades, kept in motion by some unknown mechanism. Studying their movement, I see that there are clear gaps, but whether I would be able to make use of them is hard to say. Doubtlessly, failure would be most unpleasant, possibly even deadly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_308;I can get past this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_308;This is far too dangerous...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_309;I take some time to study the pattern and eventually decide that I have it memorized. Counting carefully, I move into the passage with the swinging blades, successfully avoiding them all and making my way to the other side. Once there, I find a lever that stops the blades from moving, making it a trivial matter to escape again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_309;Simple enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_310;I do my best to memorize the pattern of the swinging blades, and once I think I have it figured out I make my move. At first, everything goes well, but as I keep moving deeper into the room I make a mistake and take a grievous wound as a result. Though I manage to make my way back to the entrance it is clearly too risky to try again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_310;I must withdraw...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_311;Thinking I have figured out the pattern of the swinging blades, I run into the passageway, expecting to reach the other side without issue. Unfortunately for me, I did not have the pattern memorized correctly, and one of the blades inflicts a terrible wound on me, and as I decide I need to escape I take another, fatal wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_311;NO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_312;I move deeper into the ruins and eventually find myself in a very large chamber. Most of the floor inside it is covered by symbols, and it is clear to me that I am supposed to be stepping in the right places to avoid having something terrible happen to me. Whether I would be able to figure out where to step is hard to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_312;I think I see the path...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_312;I should leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_313;Inspecting the symbols, I eventually realize that a number of them are identical and located rather close together. I tentatively step onto the closest one, and it does not give way under my feet even though a couple of others that are nearby drop into a pit beneath the floor. I continue forward with great care and eventually get across.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_313;It was quite simple!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_314;I step out onto one of the symbols, and nothing happens. Confident that I know how to proceed, I take a second step, and that proves to be a mistake. The floor gives way under my foot, and though I attempt to move back to the safe floorstone I previously had stepped on I am unable to do so, and I fall into a deep pit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_314;AAAARGH!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_315;I have finally reached what appears to be the heart of the ruins, and I find myself in a chamber that is much larger than any of those I encountered previously. Most of the walls are rather plain, but the one on the opposite side from where I entered appears to be glowing very faintly, even though I cannot see how that could be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_315;I should investigate the glowing wall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_315;This is a trap...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_316;The glow turns out to simply be the sunlight reflecting off of some metallic decorations set in the wall. However, those decorations appear to depict a battle against a dragon, and even though there is no actual writing on the wall the scenes depicted there give me several ideas as to how I could approach a similar fight in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_316;This will be useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_317;The wall is indeed glowing, and it is also covered with strange symbols. Judging by the number of them and how they are positioned, I suspect that it must be writing of some kind, but if so it is unlike any other writing I have ever seen before. It is impossible to say why anyone would have bothered with them or why the way to them was trapped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_317;How curious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_317;I must look for more like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_318;The glow I noticed turns out to be coming from a number of gemstones that are reflecting the sunlight. Though perhaps not the most impressive gemstones I have seen, there is quite a few of them, and I manage to pry a number of them loose with ease. Though the way was fraught with peril, it seems I shall not leave empty-handed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_318;A nice find indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_319;As I am passing through a small village on my way to the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers I notice that there are a number of merchants there to trade, and I decide to investigate their wares. One of the merchants turns out to mainly be trading in books, including one about dragons that might be of interest to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_319;I'll purchase the book!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_319;Not interested!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_320;The book I purchased from the merchant tells a story of two dragon brothers, one from the north and one from the south. Initially, they lived in harmony, but after a while they started to quarrel, and one of the dragons struck down its brother, upsetting the balance until the two reunited much later, choosing to walk together as humans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_320;A story for children...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_321;The book I purchased from the merchant tells the story of a band of brave adventurers on a quest to defeat the nefarious lord of a place referred to as "Highermost Darkstone Pinnacle", who apparently is a dragon. Unfortunately for the adventurers one of them did not pay attention and as a result they all died prior to reaching their true enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_321;What a strange story...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_321;I wish I had chicken...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_322;The book I purchased from the merchant is divided into several shorter stories about different people facing off against various legendary creatures. One of those people ends up having to fight a dragon, and the narrator carefully details how the hero manages to prevail, including strategies such as avoiding the dragon's fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_322;Fire is indeed bad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_323;The book I purchased from the merchant does not so much tell a story as it lists the problems with facing a dragon in combat. It goes into great detail about how the dragon has a number of advantages over any human foolish enough to challenge it. It seems its advice about fighting dragons is that it is to be avoided at all costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_323;That was unhelpful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_324;The book I purchased from the merchant turns out to contain a number of dragon-related sayings. While some of them vaguely might relate to fighting against dragons, there are few that seem like they might be trying to offer advice, and the few that do have unhelpful advice on the level of "Never tickle a sleeping dragon.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_324;None of this helps me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_325;The book I purchased tells a story about three dragonslayers from a frozen land "at the edge of the heavens". They set out to fight a fearsome black dragon and eventually learned a battlecry that they would shout at it, weakening it enough that they were able to defeat it, even if the book implies that they were not able to defeat it permanently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_325;Will any battlecry do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_326;The book I purchased from the merchant turns out to contain some rather unusual advice. While I have heard many stories that tell how the fiery breath of a dragon is dangerous and others have told me about the dangers of the claws and bite of a dragon, no other story I have come across has mentioned that its tail also can be used as a weapon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_326;The tail is also dangerous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_327;The book I purchased from the merchant contains a lot of information about dragons, going into great details about their scales, their legs, and more besides. However, I become somewhat concerned when I am unable to find any information about the wings, and my concern turns out to be warranted when I come across a drawing of a celestial dragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_327;That's the wrong kind of dragon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_328;The book I purchased from the merchant is a very strange one. It clearly describes of a dragon will breathe in deeply before unleashing a torrent of flames, but then the book starts speculating as to what makes the dragon want to breathe in deeply in the first place, proposing that things like the number of gnomes nearby might influence it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_328;At least some of that was useful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_329;The book I purchased from the merchant starts out with a long description about dragons being giant lizards, which I suppose might be true, but instead of continuing on with something that actually is useful to know the book seems fit to compare dragons and lizards in great detain and contrasting various differences between the two.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_329;Who wrote this thing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_330;One day I come across a preacher spreading the word of the [conversion_province.Religion.GetName] faith. One of my companions mentions our quest where the preacher can overhear it, and I am soon told in no uncertain terms that only someone following the preacher's religion would be able to stand a chance against Fredak, the Emperor of Embers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_330;I have to convert, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_330;I will take my chances!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_331;Being on the road far from [Root.Capital.GetName] is quite relaxing, and I can finally take my mind off the problems I usually face at court. Come what may, this journey has been good to me, and I do not regret undertaking it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_331;I feel like a new person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_332;The path to the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, is a long one, longer than I had expected. I find myself having less and less patience with the journey as time goes on, as I really want it to be over sooner rather than later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_332;Are. We. There. Yet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_333;Though I and my companions have been trying to avoid the worst of the mud and grime on the road it is not possible to entirely avoid it, and it is also not possible to wash it off as quickly as I would have been able to back home. Strangely enough, I find myself minding it less as time goes on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_333;Cleanliness is overrated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_334;Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, is a fearsome beast that must be hunted down. Of course, once my quest is over, there will be other beasts to hunt, and maybe I should put some effort into that when that time comes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_334;I do like hunting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_334;That is not something for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_335;There were those back home that questioned whether setting out to hunt down Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, was a wise idea, and I was not entirely sure when I set off. However, during the journey I have come to realize that it is something I had to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_335;This is my purpose in life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_336;As I draw closer to the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, I cannot help but think of what else might be found at the dragon's lair. All the reports I have heard of the beast's attacks speak of the dragon having stolen a large quantity of gold, jewels, and other precious objects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_336;Riches beyond measure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_337;I have been spending some of the time along the road playing various games of strategy with my companions, and I have been having a lot of fun. Perhaps, once this trip is over, I should dedicate myself even further to that sort of thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_337;I think I will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_337;It's not for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_338;At various points during the journey to the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, I have been discussing the upcoming battle with my companions, and I have realized that that kind of discussion can be rather interesting. Perhaps I should focus more on strategy once we return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_338;Sounds like a plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_338;I think not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_339;I have been practicing with my weapons alongside my companions during the journey, and I feel that I have gotten better at using them. Though the fight against Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, doubtlessly will not be similar to fighting against another human, perhaps I have what it takes to take up duelling once the journey is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_339;I should do that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_339;I think something else would be better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_340;As time goes on, I find that I do not mind the various detours we have to make during the trip as much as I did initially, and that I almost enjoy them in a way. You get to see quite a few interesting things you would not have come across otherwise, for one thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_340;And we are not in a hurry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_342;I and my party arrive at the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, but we are too late. The dragon has already been slain, and all of the treasures that we had expected to find in its lair are nowhere to be found, evidently looted prior to our arrival. It would appear that the journey has been a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_342;Let's just head back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_343;At the Dragon's Lair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_343;I and my party arrive at the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, certain that the dragon is waiting inside. Most likely, it does not know that we are here, but we cannot know how long it will remain unaware of our arrival.\n\nWe discuss our options, and it turns out we have different ideas as to how to proceed. Some of those that are there with me think that we should attempt to sneak in, hopefully letting us catch the dragon by surprise, while others think that the direct approach is best... and a few even suggest that maybe we should turn around before it is too late...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_343;We should use stealth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_343;We should take the direct approach!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TIANXIA_343;We should leave this place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_344;We make our way inside the lair, attempting to move as quietly as possible, but we are unsuccessful.\n\n"Who DARES enter MY lair?" the voice of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, suddenly calls out.\n\nBefore we can react two of my guards are set ablaze by a sudden gout of flame, and I realize that the dragon is close indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_344;To arms! To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_345;As we are stealthily making our way into the depths of the cavern in which Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, resides we come across a small pile of treasures. Though it certainly cannot be everything that the dragon has stolen, there is no doubt that there are some valuable objects to be found in this location.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_345;Grab what you can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_345;We can loot the place later!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_346;I am in the middle of going through the treasures when several of my guards cry out in agony. Turning around, I can see that they have been set ablaze, and I can also see the gargantuan head of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, looking down on us.\n\n"Your greed will be the end of you," the dragon growls. "Face me and BURN!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_346;There you are!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_347;I sort through the treasures until I find something that I like and quickly put it aside to make sure that none of the others in my party will claim it as their own as they all pick out a few minor items that interest them. One of my servants discreetly suggests that perhaps I could consider my quest to be over and head home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_347;No, Fredak must fall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_347;We should head home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_348;My companions are in a good mood as we move deeper into the cavern, and I think nothing of their laughter before I hear something move above me. As I look up I can see Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, looking down at your party.\n\n"Thieves BURN!" the dragon roars, breathing forth a gout of flame that engulfs several of my guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_348;To arms! To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_349;As my party makes its way around a corner I can see Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, lying ahead of us. The gargantuan crimson dragon appears to be asleep, which certainly is fortunate for us, and though I doubt that anyoune would be able to wound it particularly severely with just one blow we will hopefully be able to land one before it is able to react.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_349;SNEAK ATTACK!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_350;I move closer to the sleeping form of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, with my companions spreading out around the gargantuan creature. On my signal, we strike as one.\n\n"Did you intend to TICKLE me, INSECTS?" the dragon growls, sounding more amused than enraged as it opens its eyes and rises from the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_350;Is talking all you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_351;I move closer to the sleeping form of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, with my companions spreading out around the gargantuan creature. On my signal, we strike as one.\n\n"You DARE attack ME in MY lair?" the dragon roars in pain, taking to the air in one swift motion. "You will all BURN!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_351;You are already bleeding!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_352;I and my party successfully make our way deep inside the lair of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, without any incidents on the way. As we enter a particularly large chamber we find ourselves looking into the eyes of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers.\n\n"It looks like I have GUESTS," he growls, leaping into the air.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_352;Face me, foul beast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_354;As my party is fighting the dragon [live_bait.GetBestName] suddenly trips and falls. [live_bait.GetSheHeCap] does not appear to be injured, but I can see Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, eyeing [live_bait.GetHerHim], and I suspect that the dragon is about to attack my companion. If I move quickly, I might be able to save [live_bait.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_354;I should help [live_bait.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_354;We can use [live_bait.GetHerHim] as bait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_355;I react quickly and move to help [live_bait.GetBestName] back to [live_bait.GetHerHis] feet well before Fredak can make a move in our direction, and both of us manage to get out of the way with ease. My companion praises me for my assistance, and promises that [live_bait.GetSheHe] never will forget what I did for [live_bait.GetHerHim] this day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_355;Think nothing of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_356;I move to assist [live_bait.GetBestName] and manage to help [live_bait.GetHerHim] back onto [live_bait.GetHerHis] feet before Fredak can attack, but I am a bit slower than I should be and the dragon's claws tear into me before I can get out of the way. Luckily, [live_bait.GetBestName] is there to help me aside before I get a serious injury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_356;We're in this together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_357;I manage to help [live_bait.GetBestName] get back to [live_bait.GetHerHis] feet and both of us try to take cover behind a raised portion of the uneven floor of the dragon's lair. Unfortunately, I manage to trip on the way there, and though my companion is able to drag me aside Fredak still lands a vicious blow on me before I am out of his reach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_357;I'll survive this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_358;I ready your weapon to strike as Fredak attacks [live_bait.GetBestName]. My companion is almost back to [live_bait.GetHerHis] feet when the Fredak makes his attack, but [live_bait.GetSheHe] is unable to escape the dragon's wrath, much like the dragon is unable to avoid my blows. It is likely the rest of my companions know what I did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_358;[live_bait.GetSheHeCap] died so that we can live!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_359;I make myself ready to strike at Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, once he attacks [live_bait.GetBestName], but it would seem my companion is not content to play the part of the bait and successfully gets away before the dragon attacks [live_bait.GetHerHim]. Judging by the look I receive, [live_bait.GetSheHe] saw what I was planning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_359;This is all a misunderstanding!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_360;Fredak flies by overhead, and I manage to avoid his fangs and his claws with ease despite him making several attempts to strike at me with them. The tail lashes out he flies past, and I realize I need to dodge out of its way, though it is rather hard to tell which direction I should move in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_360;I'll dodge to the right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_360;Left! I dodge left!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_361;I leap to the side as the tail strikes at me and manage to correctly guess which direction to move to avoid getting hit. Moreover, the dragon appears to have been distracted by the fact that it did not hit me, and several of my companions manage to land blows on it before it can fully recover from its confusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_361;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_362;I leap to the side as the tail strikes at me, but I move in the wrong direction and am sent flying. I land quite hard, even if I do not think that any bones are broken, and though the dragon does not follow up on its attack on me at the moment I suspect that the blow might prove to be a disadvantage later on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_362;That could have gone better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_363;"You were all FOOLS to come into MY lair," the dragon roars, letting out a gout of fire above our heads. "You will all BURN, and then I will seek out your loved ones and THEY will also BURN!"\n\nSeveral of my companions appear quite shaken by the dragon's words, and I have to admit that I also am a bit shaken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_363;He... he lies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_364;I shout encouragements at my companions and see them become more determined to stand their ground. One of them cries out "[Root.GetBestName] and victory!", and others quickly take up the battlecry. Looking over at Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, I can see a look of puzzlement on the dragon's face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_364;We shall triumph this day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_365;I make my best effort to strengthen the resolve of my companions, but I can see that it is not having the desired effect. Several of my guards even drop their weapons and attempt to run from the battle, only to get burned to a crisp as they flee. Looking at the dragon, I can see a cruel smile on its lips.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_365;We were fools to come here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_367;As I and [would_be_traitor.GetBestName] are moving around and trying to find a good angle my companion's leg suddenly gets in my way and I find myself falling to the ground. I look up at [would_be_traitor.GetHerHim] in surprise, and judging by the smile on [would_be_traitor.GetHerHis] face I was not tripped by accident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_367;I should focus on getting back up;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_367;I should focus on dragging them down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_368;I get back to my feet before Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, can notice that I am in a vulnerable position, and I manage to find cover before he can attack [would_be_traitor.GetBestName] is nearby, and judging by their expression they are not particularly pleased that I escaped the dragon's wrath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_368;I'll deal with this traitor later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_369;Angry at [would_be_traitor.GetBestName]'s betrayal, I decide to try to drag them down so that they will be an easier target for Fredak, the Emperor of Embers. Unfortunately, I am unable to get a grip of them before they can get out of the way, and since I was distracted I fail to move out of the way in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_369;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_370;I reach out and drag [would_be_traitor.GetBestName] onto the ground next to me. Both of us attempt to get back on our feet and out of the way before Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, can attack us, but due to the actions of the other neither of us manages to escape without suffering grievous wounds from the dragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_370;At least [would_be_traitor.GetSheHe] also got hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_371;I reach out and grab onto [would_be_traitor.GetBestName], pulling myself up while also pulling them down. Seeing Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, moving in our direction, I run to the nearest cover I can find. Once there, I turn around just in time to see [would_be_traitor.GetBestName] take a grievous wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_371;That is what you get!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_372;I suddenly find myself face-to-face with Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, and based on where I am standing I do not think I will be able to get to cover before the dragon can unleash its fire upon me.\n\n"Get out of here!" [died_for_you.GetBestName] suddenly shouts, jumping in the way of the dragon and taking a fatal blow for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_372;I will avenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_373;Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, suddenly lets out a deep roar and flies up towards the ceiling of the cavern. At first I expect him to dive down towards me or one of my companions, but instead the dragon starts attacking the ceiling, sending several large rocks falling down towards me and the others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_373;Take cover!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_374;My warning is timely, and I and all of my companions manage to avoid the rocks even though the dragon keeps dropping more of them towards us for some time. Several of the soldiers I have with me manage to hit the dragon with arrows, javelins, and other ranged weapons while it is distracted, and it lets out a roar of pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_374;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_375;Though I shout out my warning and everyone runs for cover it is impossible to avoid all the rocks that are dropped towards us, and I and several others are struck by them. While I only am lightly injured some of the guards I brought with me are not so lucky, being crushed by the rocks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_375;That's not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_377;I and my companions keep fighting against Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, and it is hard to tell which side is winning at the moment. We have tried a few different tricks We planned ahead of time, but though some of them have paid off we have yet to win the battle. Perhaps it is time to try something more unconventional?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_377;Look behind you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_377;Cheap tricks won't work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_378;To my surprise, Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, spins around in confusion upon hearing my words, and I and my companions manage to land several blows on the dragon before he realizes that he has been tricked.\n\n"You will BURN for this, INSECT!" he roars, and his voice sounds both pained and angry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_378;That actually worked?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_379;The dragon turns around, and my companions move in to strike at him, but the beast quickly turns back to face them and lets out a fiery breath, burning several of them quite badly.\n\n"You must be getting DESPERATE, if you have to use CHEAP TRICKS," Fredak growls, giving me a toothy smile. "What feeble effort shall be next?".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_379;Well, that didn't work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_380;Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, suddenly lands in front of me and starts to take a deep breath. I strongly suspect that he is about to breathe fire towards me, and it would probably be wise to move into cover, but the dragon has left its throat exposed, and I might be able to get close enough to strike before it breathes out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_380;I attack the dragon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_380;I take cover!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_381;I move towards the dragon, deftly avoiding its claws, and strike at its exposed throat. Though the wound I inflict certainly is not fatal, it is still a noticeable wound, and the dragon roars in pain and leaps back into the air, seemingly having forgotten its plan to breathe fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_381;An exploitable weakness, it seems...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_382;As I move towards the dragon one of its limbs reach out and swats me aside. Though I am sent far enough away from the dragon that I no longer am in danger of being burned by its breath, I still take a fierce blow. Luckily, nothing appers to have broken from either the initial attack or the impact when I hit the wall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_382;That did not go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_383;As I am considering my next move against the dragon I spot a patch of discolored scales close to where I expect its heart to be. It is quite possibly an old wound, and if so it is quite possible that it has not yet healed completely, which might mean it is a possible weak spot worth attacking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_383;I will stike at the discoloration!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_383;It wouldn't work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_384;I strike at the patch of discolored scales when next I attack the dragon. It lets out a roar of pain and rage when I hit it, and judging by the fact that it tries to cover that part of its body as best it can while still fighting I am reasonably certain that it indeed was an old wound;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_384;I should try to strike there again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_385;I strike at the patch of discolored scales, but to my dismay all that happens is that a few of them come loose, revealing that they were concealing scales with the same crimson color as the rest of the dragon. I find myself unsure if various other spots I thought were wounds also simply were old scales.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_385;That did not work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_388;Fire and Blood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_388;My party keeps on fighting Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, but even though we land the occasional blow the battle is not going our way. One by one, we meet our end, by fang, by claw, or by fire.\n\nIt almost seem as if the dragon is toying with me in particular, as I am the last person standing and manage to stay alive for some time, but eventually it knocks me to the ground and leans down towards me.\n\n"You should have known not to challenge ME, little human," it growls, opening its jaws wide and letting out a massive torrent of fire that is the last thing I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_388;Could anyone prevail?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_389;Defiant to the Last;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_389;The fight against Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, goes well at first, but soon the tide turns, and the dragon starts picking off my companions one by one. It takes several wounds in the process, to be sure, and actually appears to be in pain, but even so none of us actually manage to slay it.\n\n"I have to admit you fought well, litte human," the dragon growls towards me when I am the only one left alive from my party. It inclines its head very slightly, then gives me a toothy smile. "But not well enough. Make peace with whatever gods you pray to!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_389;Someone will finish the job!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_390;The Dragon Lies Bleeding;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_390;It is done! Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, lets out one final, weak roar and then stops moving. Fearing a trap, I and the others that fought the beast keep attacking it for seveal minutes, but we stop once it is clear that it actually is dead. From this day and until the end of days I shall be known as [Root.GetTitledFirstName] the Dragonslayer!\n\nNow that the beast is out of the way, it is high time for me and and my companions to discover where it keeps the treasures it has collected, as we certainly deserve whatever spoils we may find.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_390;We did it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_391;Word has reached me that Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, has been slain by a party of adventurers assembled by [From.GetTitledName], now known as [From.GetBestName]. Without doubt, [From.GetSheHe] and [From.GetHerHis] party has already taken possession of anything of value that could be found in the dragon's lair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_391;A glorious victory, to be sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_391;I guess we should head home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_392;At the very heart of the dragon's lair my party finds a chamber that is all but overflowing with gold, silver, precious gems, and artifacts of various kinds. Some of my companions see fit to take some of the lesser pieces for themselves, which I do not particularly care about as there are greater riches for me to claim as my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_392;Riches untold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_395;I have been on the road for quite some time, and at times it has felt as if I never might see my home again, but eventually I start to recognize some familiar landmarks, and it is not long before I and my companions reach our destination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_395;Home at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
