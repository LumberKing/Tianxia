EVTDESC_SOH_8536;The Treasure Fleet has arrived off the eastern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, with several ships approaching each major port in the region, bringing with them people and goods from the Middle Kingdom.\n\nAs merchants on their way to India from the Persian Gulf have to journey past this region and many of those from other places further west elect to follow the coast rather than journeying across the Indian Ocean the region is quite busy, and since Muslim pilgrims on the Hajj also might be passing by there are also other travellers present to witness the arrival of the Treasure Fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
