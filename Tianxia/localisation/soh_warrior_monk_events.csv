EVTDESC_SOH_10103;The monks that have been teaching me have spent some time reinforcing one of Sun Tzu's lessons, namely that you need to know yourself in order to win a battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_10108;I have at times eaten rather more than I probably should have, but thanks to the rigorous training the warrior monks have put me through recently I have started to lose some weight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_10108;I have gotten back in shape!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
