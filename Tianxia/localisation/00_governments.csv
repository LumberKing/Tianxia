eastern_imperial_government_desc;Though not going so far as to claim the Mandate of Heaven, rulers with the Eastern Imperial government emulate the Chinese Imperial system even more thoroughly than those with the Confucian Bureaucracy government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
japanese_imperial_government;Japanese Imperial;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
japanese_imperial_government_desc;Though taking some inspiration from the Chinese Imperial government, the Japanese Imperial government is structured somewhat differently and has discarded the concept of the Mandate of Heaven. The Imperial Family's sole right to the Chrysanthemum Throne is universally seen as unquestionable... but the Tenno being a mere figurehead is not necessarily a controversial idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

japanese_bureaucracy_government_desc;Greatly inspired by the government system of the Tang dynasty, the Japanese Bureaucracy government is supposed to be a bureaucratic meritocracy, but many see it as just a stepping stone on the way to something along feudal lines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_SOH_3504;Amaterasu Defied;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3504;[Root.GetTennoKogo] [From.GetFirstName] has died without an heir. While [From.GetSheHe] was a mortal [From.GetManWoman] like any other and [From.GetHerHis] death thus was to be expected sooner or later, the lack of a member of the Imperial Family to inherit the Chrysanthemum Throne is unprecedented, seeing as the Imperial Family has possessed it since time immemorial.\n\nWith the succession unclear, [Root.GetTennoKogo] [From.GetFirstName]'s former realm has crumbled, and the belief of many of the Shinto faithful has crumbled alongside it, with many abandoning their faith altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_3525;Perhaps there are other options?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3526;It seems [From.GetBestName] has leveraged [From.GetHerHis] considerable influence at court to secure more power for [From.GetHerselfHimself] at my expense. Sadly, I am in no position to oppose this for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3526;[From.GetSheHeCap] forgets [From.GetHerHis] place...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3527;Even though there are many in [From.GetBestName]'s court that are well aware that it is in the interest of the realm for me to have rather considerable authority it seems [From.GetBestName] has still managed to leverage [From.GetHerHis] influence to somewhat reduce my authority.
EVTOPTA_SOH_3527;[From.GetSheHeCap] is perhaps not content as a puppet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3590;[Root.GetBestName]\nI have decided that it would be in the interest of the realm for you to marry [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]. I have taken the liberty of ensuring that the wedding can take place immediately.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[FromFrom.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3590;I guess I have a new wife...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3528;[From.GetBestName] has come to the conclusion that some of my wealth would be better in [From.GetHerHis] hands. [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that [From.GetSheHe] will be spending it in a fashion that will benefit the realm, but I have my doubts that that is the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3528;[From.GetSheHeCap] is just a common thief!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3529;[From.GetBestName] came to see me today and wasted no time before informing me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it would be best for the realm if I spent the next year far, far away from government affairs. [From.GetSheHeCap] also let me know that [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to assign me a large number of guards to ensure everything goes as planned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3529;I... have no choice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3530;I have just received word that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has seen fit to release [From.GetBestName] from prison, supposedly acting in my name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3530;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] didn't even ask me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3532;I have just received word that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has seen fit to execute one of my prisoners, [From.GetBestName], supposedly acting in my name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3532;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] didn't even ask me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3534;It seems [FromFrom.GetBestName] has decided that [From.GetBestName] being on the council is not to [FromFrom.GetHerHis] liking, as [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has let [From.GetBestName] know that [From.GetHerHis] presence no longer is desired.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3534;At least [From.GetBestName] does not blame me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3535;I have just been informed by [FromFrom.GetBestName] that I am not welcome at any more council meetings for the time being, supposedly because the realm would benefit more from someone else in my old position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3535;This wasn't [Root.Liege.GetBestName]'s idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3538;[Root.GetBestName]\nIt is clear to me that the realm would be better served by [From.GetBestName] being my direct vassal, and I have taken the necessary steps to ensure that this indeed is the case.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[FromFrom.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3538;I am in no position to oppose this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3539;[ROOT:GetBestName]\nIt is clear to me that the realm is better served by you being my direct vassal, and I have taken the necessary steps to ensure that this is indeed the case.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[FromFrom.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3539;I suppose that's fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3539;I have a bad feeling about this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3540;[Root.GetBestName]\nIt is clear to me that it would be best for the realm if I personally held [From.GetName], and I have taken the necessary steps to ensure that this indeed is the case.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[FromFrom.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3540;I am in no position to oppose this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3541;[Root.GetBestName],\nIt is apparent to everyone that you currently are unfit to serve as the Permanent Regent, and everyone agrees that I should serve in your stead. I am sure you will see things my way, at least in time.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3541;I'll remember this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3542;[Root.GetBestName],\nI am pleased to inform you that our combined efforts have paid off. I am now the Permanent Regent for [Root.Liege.GetBestName], and my tenure will continue indefinitely, for the good of the realm.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3542;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3543;[Root.GetBestName],\nYour former Permanent Regent was obviously unfit to serve, so I have taken the liberty to take over the Permanent Regency. For the good of the realm, this state of things will of course continue indefinitely.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3543;I suppose this is no worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3544;[Root.GetBestName],\nIt is clear that the realm would only benefit from a Permanent Regency under me. I suggest that you agree with this demand, as I and my backers otherwise will compel you by force of arms.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3544;I suppose I can accept this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3544;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3545;[Root.GetBestName],\nI assume you wish to know that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been named as my Permanent Regent and that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] will be in charge of a Permanent Regency.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3545;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3546;[Root.GetBestName],\nIn the interests of the realm as a whole, I have decided to accept that making you my Permanent Regent and agreeing to a Permanent Regency is a wise course of action.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3546;Assuming indirect control!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3547;[Root.GetBestName],\nYour claim that a Permanent Regency would be best for the realm is false, and your attempt to take power from me is treason. My armies will be coming to arrest you and those who would side with you.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3547;Then prepare for war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3548;[Root.GetBestName],\nIt is clear that the realm would only benefit from a Permanent Regency under me. I suggest that you agree with this demand, as I and my backers otherwise will compel you by force of arms.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

### Chinese law change request events
EVTDESC_SOH_4507_A;[From.GetBestName], one of the more influential eunuchs at court, has submitted a petition requesting further authority for him and his fellow eunuchs, claiming that this would be in the interests of the realm as they are not easily swayed by dynastic interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4507_B;One of the more influential eunuchs at court, has submitted a petition requesting further authority for him and his fellow eunuchs, claiming that this would be in the interests of the realm as they are not easily swayed by dynastic interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4507;A most sensible proposal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4507;I can give you command of a regiment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4507;How about I just owe you a Favor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4507;Do me a favor and forget this matter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_4507;How about I fire [councillor_to_fire.GetBestName] instead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_4507;I will get back to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_SOH_4507;I think this gold will make you reconsider...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTH_SOH_4507;Perhaps I can convince you otherwise?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTI_SOH_4507;Do you really think this is wise?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTJ_SOH_4507;Absolutely not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4508;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] has decided to fire me. Apparently, one of the eunuchs insisted that the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven should grant certain concessions to him, and [From.GetSheHe] decided to fire me rather than dealing with the matter in some more appropriate manner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4508;I will remember this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4509;I take some time to explain just how unreasonable the eunuch's proposal looks from my perspective and how it would potentially anger others in the realm. To my surprise, my words seem to actually convince the eunuch, as he offers to withdraw the petition immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4509;That actually worked?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4511_A;[From.GetBestName] listens to my expanation, his expression unreadable as I speak. Once I finish, he tells me that my words only have made it clearer that the realm would benefit from him and his fellow eunuchs being in a position to make more decisions without my direct involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4511_B; The eunuch listens to my expanation, his expression unreadable as I speak. Once I finish, he tells me that my words only have made it clearer that the realm would benefit from him and his fellow eunuchs being in a position to make more decisions without my direct involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4511;Fine, have it your way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4511;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4512;I tell the eunuch that perhaps angering the [Root.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven is not a wise course of action, and that wasting someone's time with a petition like this easily could anger them. After a moment, the eunuch offers to withdraw the petition, stating that he has reconsidered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4512;That actually worked?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4514_A;[From.GetBestName] does not seem at all impressed by the veiled threats I make about the danger of incurring the displeasure of the [Root.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven. Once I stop speaking, he tells me that my words make it clear that the realm would be better off if he and his fellow eunuchs made more decisions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_4514;Fine, have it your way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4514;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4516;I half expected one of the eunuchs to cause some kind of disturbance following their petition being refused, but nothing of the sort has happened. Indeed, it almost seems as if they have forgotten about the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4516;Fine by me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4517;It seems [chosen_eunuch.GetBestName] has not managed to get over the matter of me refusing to grant his petition, seeing as he has been overheard complaining about it several times. So far, he still seems to be carrying out his tasks appropriately aside from the grumbling, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4517;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4518;It is clear to everyone that [chosen_eunuch.GetBestName] has taken my refusal to grant his petition very personally, as he has been acting in a manner just shy of being punishable by imprisonment or execution. I suspect he will need to be watched carefully from now on...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4518;Will someone rid me of this turbulent eunuch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4519;There was a time when I would have been considered [chosen_eunuch.GetBestName]'s friend, but it is clear that he no longer feels that is true. Most likely, my refusal to grant his petition is to blame, even though I had a good reason to do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4519;Some "friend"!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4520;[chosen_eunuch.GetBestName] has been avoiding me lately, and today he bluntly told me that he no longer feels he honestly can say that he loves me. I did not need to ask why that was the case, as this all started after I rejected his petition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4520;He clearly never loved me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4521;Not only did I manage to upset the eunuch whose petition I refused, but it seems as if all of the eunuchs in the palace are displeased with me. Clearly, regardless of whether they can agree about other things or not they can agree about wanting more power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_4536;You? No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4537;It seems the eunuch that approached me with the petition seems intent to make me regret not granting his wish, seeing as I have learned that he seems to have been involved in the crafting of several orders that clearly are meant to make me look like a fool. Even worse, there is not enough evidence to act on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4537;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4538;I have received word from several provincial governors that they have received supposedly official edicts worded in an insulting fashion, clearly meant to harm their opinion of me. Though it is impossible to say for certain, the wording some parts of the edicts seems quite similar to the wording of the petition I received a while back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4538;Curse that eunuch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4539;I have just received an official-looking edict supposedly written in the name of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven. The edict is written in a highly irregular manner, reading as if it was meant as an insult, and though I suspect a forgery at first it clearly bears the official seal of [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4539;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4540;There have been times when my authority as Grand Chancellor has been insufficient to ensure that matters could be resolved in a manner I felt would truly benefit the realm. Perhaps I should submit a petition to [Root.Liege.GetBestName] to request further authority?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SOH_4540;Actually, I don't need more influence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4541;[From.GetBestName], my Grand Chancellor, has submitted a petition asking for further authority to be granted to [From.GetHerHim]. It is possible [From.GetSheHe] only seeks personal power, but it is also possible an influential Grand Chancellor could be of assistance at times, so it is not entirely clear whether I should approve this petition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTK_SOH_4541;I think a few veiled threats will make [From.GetHerHim] reconsider...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTL_SOH_4541;Petition denied!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4542;The [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven has seen fit to grant me the increased authority I requested as Grand Chancellor. This will make it easier for me to do what is required for the realm to prosper... whether under [From.GetBestName]'s rule or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4542;Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4543;The petition I submitted to the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven has been denied, but it seems [From.GetBestName] feels that I am owed something for my loyal service to the realm as the refusal came alongside a decree promising that I am owed a substantial reward from the Dragon Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4543;I suppose that's also beneficial...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4544;Though the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven did not see fit to grant my petition for increased authority [From.GetBestName] clearly thinks I am owed something for my service, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] instead has seen fit to arrange for me to marry [bride_to_be.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_4547;I have received word from the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven that [From.GetSheHe] would prefer for me to withdraw my petition. [From.GetBestName]'s response makes it very clear that this is what [From.GetSheHe] wants as repayment for the Favor I owe [From.GetHerHim], and as I had promised a repayment of [From.GetHerHis] choice I must accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4547;If only I could alter the deal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4548;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has seen fit to fire me due to [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s dislike of me. This is clearly an insufficient justification for such an act, but that does not seem to matter to [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4548;I will remember this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4549;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, feels it is not the right time to grant me increased authority. However, [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to fire [councillor_to_fire.GetBestName], whose agenda at court often has been contrary to my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4549;I can work with this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4550;I have been informed that the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven is unable to grant my petition at this time, but that [From.GetSheHe] feels that I am owed something for my loyal service. Because of this, [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to send me a substantial amount of money. It would of course be rude to call it a bribe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4550;I suppose this will do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4551;I have been informed that the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven will look into the matter of my petition when the time is right. [From.GetBestName]'s reply made it very clear that [From.GetSheHe] will contact me about the matter, and that I should avoid contacting [From.GetHerHim] about it until further notice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4551;Well, I tried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4552;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has sent me a missive informing me of several reasons [From.GetSheHe] can see not to grant my petition at this time, and has asked me to withdraw it. [From.GetHerHisCap] reasoning was actually quite good, and it would be unwise not to grant [From.GetHerHis] request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4552;[From.GetSheHeCap] made some very good points!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4553;I sent a missive to [From.GetBestName] asking [From.GetHerHim] to withdraw [From.GetHerHis] petition for increased authority as Grand Chancellor, offering a few reasons that perhaps were a bit flimsy. However, it seems [From.GetBestName] was convinced by the missive, as the petition has been withdrawn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4553;I am surprised that worked...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4554;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has sent me a missive informing me of several reasons [From.GetSheHe] can see not to grant my petition at this time, and has asked me to withdraw it.

EVTOPTA_SOH_4554;Was that supposed to convince me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4555;I sent a missive to [From.GetBestName] asking [From.GetHerHim] to withdraw [From.GetHerHis] petition for increased authority as Grand Chancellor, offering a few reasons that perhaps were a bit flimsy.

EVTOPTA_SOH_4555;Fine! Petition granted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4555;In that case, I must refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4556;I was summoned to meet with the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven to discuss my petition today.

EVTOPTA_SOH_4559;I suppose I must grant the petition...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4559;Even so, I will not grant your petition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4561;The [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven has seen fit to refuse my petition. To be perfectly honest, I never really thought it would be accepted, so this is not much of a surprise, even if it would have been nice if it had been accepted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4561;Well, I tried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4562;[From.GetBestName] seems to have taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] petition quite well, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] does not seem to even have complained about the matter in private.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4562;I suppose that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4563;The [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven has seen fit to refuse my petition, even though it clearly would have been good for the realm as a whole if [From.GetSheHe] had accepted it. I have been a loyal Grand Chancellor, and I should receive better treatment than this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4563;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4564;[From.GetBestName] has not taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] petition well, and has been complaining about it both in public and in private. It seems [From.GetSheHe] thinks that [From.GetHerHis] service has been exemplary, and that [From.GetSheHe] is entitled to certain benefits as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4564;I am not surprised...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4565;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap of Heaven, has not seen fit to grant my most reasonable petition. I suppose it is possible that [From.GetSheHe] did not refuse this out of personal enmity, but in a way it feels personal, and maybe I should not forgive this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4565;[From.GetSheHeCap] has made an enemy this day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4565;I wouldn't go that far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4566;It seems [From.GetBestName] has taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] petition very personally, as [From.GetSheHe] has been overheard claiming that it is clear that I do not respect [From.GetHerHim] and that [From.GetSheHe] feels that I wish for [From.GetHerHim] to be an enemy... and that [From.GetSheHe] is feels the same way about me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4566;This could be a problem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4567;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap of Heaven, has not seen fit to grant my most reasonable petition. I would have thought that [From.GetSheHe] would have seen fit to grant me further authority, seeing as we are friends, but apparently [From.GetSheHe] does not consider that sufficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4567;[From.GetSheHeCap] is no friend of mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4567;I wouldn't go that far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4568;It seems [From.GetBestName] has taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] petition very personally, as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] no longer considers me [From.GetHerHis] friend. I had thought that our friendship would have been sufficient to make [From.GetHerHim] accept my refusal gracefully, but apparently it was not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4568;Some "friend"...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4569;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has not seen fit to grant my most reasonable petition. I would have thought that [From.GetSheHe] would have seen fit to grant me further authority, seeing as we are lovers, but apparently [From.GetSheHe] does not consider that sufficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4569;[From.GetSheHeCap] clearly does not love me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4569;I wouldn't go that far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4570;It seems [From.GetBestName] has taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] petition very personally, as [From.GetSheHe] has made it very clear that [From.GetSheHe] thinks I no longer love [From.GetHerHim], and that [From.GetSheHe] definitely feels the same way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4570;[From.GetSheHeCap] clearly never loved me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4571;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, refused to grant my petition despite my loyal service as Grand Chancellor. Perhaps I should let everyone in the realm know that [From.GetSheHe] does not reward loyalty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4571;It is only fair...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4571;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4572;I have learned that [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to send forth messages informing the realm of my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] supposedly reasonable petition. Doubtlessly, [From.GetSheHe] has framed those messages in a way that makes my refusal seem anything but reasonable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4572;This is not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4573;I have received a letter from [FromFrom.GetBestName], the Grand Chancellor of [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven. Apparently, [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to refuse a petition to ever so slightly increase [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s authority, despite [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s most faithful service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4573;How ungrateful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4574;My very reasonable petition has been refused by the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, despite me being a most faithful Grand Chancellor. I could very easily make [From.GetBestName] regret this by altering the wording of some official decrees to make [From.GetHerHim] come across in an unflattering way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4574;[From.GetSheHeCap] deserves no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4574;I can't do this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4575;It seems [From.GetBestName] might not have taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] petition well, as several official decrees [From.GetSheHe] has overseen have been sent out worded in a fashion that makes me come across in a rather unflattering way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4575;Curse [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4576;My petition was refused by [From.GetBestName] with no sensible justification. I think payback might be in order, and as I know [possible_gc_lover.GetBestName] is not particularly close to [From.GetBestName] perhaps convincing [possible_gc_lover.GetHerHim] to sleep with me would be suitable payback?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4576;I will proposition [possible_gc_lover.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4576;It would be wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4577;[From.GetBestName] seems to have taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] petition quite well, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] does not seem to even have complained about the matter in private.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4577;I suppose that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4578;One day I am approached by [From.GetBestName], the Grand Chancellor. [From.GetSheHeCap] has our respective attendants dismissed so that we may speak in private, and then suggests that perhaps we should retire somewhere private to get to know each other intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4578;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4578;Absolutely not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4579;[From.GetBestName] was quite receptive to my suggestion, and between [From.GetHerHis] influence and mine it was trivial to ensure that we would not be disturbed while we got to know each other much more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4579;I look forward to doing this again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4579;This was a one-time thing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4580;After a while in [From.GetBestName]'s company the two of us need to part ways to deal with our respective duties. [From.GetBestName] makes it clear that [From.GetSheHe] would be open to further intimate encounters, particularly with [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName] not treating either of us well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4580;That sounds wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4581;After a while in [From.GetBestName]'s company the two of us need to part ways to deal with our respective duties. [From.GetBestName] makes it clear that while [From.GetSheHe] enjoyed my company [From.GetSheHe] thinks it would be wise for us to not make a habit out of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4581;Perhaps that is for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4582;I arranged for [From.GetBestName]'s attendants and mine to be dismissed so that we could speak in private, and made my proposition. However, [From.GetSheHe] was most unreceptive, and summoned [From.GetHerHis] attendants to [From.GetHerHis] side immediately so that [From.GetSheHe] could depart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4582;What a prudish [From.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4584;Today I was approached by [From.GetBestName] with a request to grant further authority to [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetHerHis] fellow courtiers. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] feels that the current state of affairs benefits other groups, such as the eunuchs and my vassals, far too much, and both of those groups could of course be a problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4584;I think that's an excellent idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4584;I'll make you my primary spouse instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4584;I will make you my spouse instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4584;I will increase your consort rank instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_4584;I will arrange an Imperial Marriage instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_4584;I will grant you a Favor instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_SOH_4584;You owe me a Favor, so forget about this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTH_SOH_4584;I will fire someone you dislike instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTI_SOH_4584;I think I can deflect this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTJ_SOH_4584;I will give you a "gift" instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTK_SOH_4584;I can refuse this diplomatically...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTL_SOH_4584;Perhaps a threat will work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTM_SOH_4584;This is not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4585;I have just received word that I have been fired from the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's council. Apparently, [From.GetBestName] was approached by [FromFrom.GetBestName] about a petition [From.GetSheHe] did not wish to grant, and firing me seemed like a suitable alternative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4585;Curse them both!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4586;I spend some time explaining to [FromFrom.GetBestName] why granting [FromFrom.GetHerHis] petition would be a bad idea, and how the realm would benefit more from me not granting it. To my surprise, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] immediately offers to withdraw it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4586;That... worked?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4587;[From.GetBestName] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] does not think that granting my petition would be a good idea, suggesting that it would go against the interests of the realm. However, [From.GetHerHis] arguments were flimsy at best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4587;I will ask again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4588;It seems I was unable to convince [From.GetBestName] that [From.GetSheHe] should withdraw [From.GetHerHis] petition for the good of the realm, as [From.GetSheHe] repeated [From.GetHerHis] request after I had presented my best arguments against it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4588;Fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4588;Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4589;I make sure that [FromFrom.GetBestName] knows that [FromFrom.GetHerHis] petition is something that an less generous person might interpret as treasonous, suggesting that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] should withdraw it. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] immediately does this when I finish speaking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4589;As I expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4590;[From.GetBestName] apparently thinks that a less generous person might interpret my petition as somewhat treasonous, and suggests that perhaps I wish to withdraw it, but I doubt [From.GetSheHe] really is seriously implying that [From.GetSheHe] does not like it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4590;I will ask again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4591;It seems my veiled threats went over [From.GetBestName]'s head, or were unconvincing if they were understood, seeing as [From.GetBestName] repeated [From.GetHerHis] request almost as soon as I finished making the threat. I guess I must be direct if I wish to refuse the petition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4591;Fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4591;Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4593;I half expected one of the courtiers to cause some kind of disturbance following [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s petition being refused, but nothing of the sort has happened. Indeed, it almost seems as if they have forgotten about the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4593;Fine by me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4594;It seems [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] has not managed to get over the matter of me refusing to grant [FromFromFrom.GetHerHis] petition, seeing as [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] has been overheard complaining about it several times. So far, [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] seems content with grumbling, however..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4594;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4595;It is clear to everyone that [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] has taken my refusal to grant [FromFromFrom.GetHerHis] petition very personally, as [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] has been acting in a manner just shy of being punishable by imprisonment or execution. I suspect [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] will need to be watched carefully from now on...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4595;This could be a problem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4596;There was a time when I would have been considered [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s friend, but it is clear that [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] no longer feels that is true. Most likely, my refusal to grant [FromFromFrom.GetHerHis] petition is to blame, even though I had a good reason to do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4596;Some "friend"!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4597;[FromFromFrom.GetBestName] has been avoiding me lately, and today [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] bluntly told me that [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] no longer feels [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] honestly can say that [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] loves me. I did not need to ask why that was the case, as this all started after I rejected [FromFromFrom.GetHerHis] petition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4597;[FromFromFrom.GetSheHeCap] clearly never loved me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4598;It seems nearly every [FromFromFrom.GetManWoman] in my life is upset with me these days, as my refusal to grant [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s petition apparently is something they all feel is most unreasonable, even though they often disagree about other things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4598;I should be careful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4599;[From.GetBestName]'s refusal to grant my petition was quite unjustifiable. I feel like I should try to get back at him. Perhaps seducing one of [From.GetHerHis] councillors would be just the thing? I suspect [possible_courtier_lover.GetBestName] might be interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4599;I will approach [possible_courtier_lover.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4599;I think that's going too far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4600;Today I was approached by [From.GetBestName], who asked to speak to me privately. I granted the request, and [From.GetSheHe] brought up the matter of a recent disagreement [From.GetSheHe] had with [FromFrom.GetBestName], suggesting that we could retire to my bedroom to discuss it in detail, among other activities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4600;What a great idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4600;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4601;[From.GetBestName] was receptive to my proposition, and it was easy for us to meet privately in [From.GetHerHis] bedroom to talk, among other things. It was an enjoyable time, and now that it is time to leave I need to decide whether it is something I think we should do again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4601;We should do this again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4601;This was a one-time thing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4602;[From.GetBestName] and I had a very enjoyable time together, and as [From.GetSheHe] was about to leave [From.GetSheHe] told me that [From.GetSheHe] hopes that we will be able to meet privately for further "discussions".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4602;I look forward to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4603;[From.GetBestName] and I had a very enjoyable time together. However, as [From.GetSheHe] was about to leave [From.GetSheHe] informed me that it probably would not be a good idea for us to make a habit out of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4603;Possibly for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4604;[From.GetBestName] was not interested in my proposition, telling me that [From.GetSheHe] feels I should leave [From.GetHerHis] presence in a hurry before [From.GetSheHe] feels the need to tell the [FromFromFrom.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven about what I said.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4604;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4606;As I am about to retire for the night a guard comes running, bringing word that someone has made an attempt to murder one of my children, specifically [From.GetBestName]. The attempt was unsuccessful, but the would-be murderer is still on the loose, and is suspected to be someone that easily could gain access to [From.GetBestName]'s quarters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4606;[chosen_courtier.GetBestName], perhaps?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4607;As I am about to retire for the night a guard comes running, bringing word that an attempt has been made on the life of my [From.GetSonDaughter] [From.GetBestName]. The attempt was unsuccessful, and the guards have caught the would-be murderer, namely [courtier_murderer.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4607;Off with [chosen_courtier.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4607;Throw [chosen_courtier.GetHerHis] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4608;As I am about to retire for the night a guard comes running, bringing word that my [From.GetSonDaughter] [From.GetBestName] has been found murdered. Despite the guards' best efforts, the killer is still at large, and it seems quite likely that they had easy access to [From.GetBestName]'s quarters and knew [From.GetSheHe] would be there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4608;[chosen_courtier.GetBestName], perhaps?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4609;As I am about to retire for the night a guard comes running, bringing word that my [From.GetSonDaughter] [From.GetBestName] has been murdred. The killer was caught fleeing from the scene, and is apparently none other than [courtier_murderer.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4609;Off with [chosen_courtier.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4609;Throw [chosen_courtier.GetHerHis] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4610;One evening when I have almost fallen asleep I hear the sound of someone moving nearby. Turning towards the sound, I see a shadowed figure standing near my bed.\n\n"You know what this is about," the figure says, raising a dagger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4610;Guards! To me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4611;I manage to fend off the would-be assassin well enough until my guards arrive, and they take no chances when they reach me, cutting down the assassin. Despite thoroughly investigating the body, nothing is discovered tying the dead woman to any specific person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4611;Maybe it was [chosen_courtier.GetBestName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4611;I need to watch them all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4612;I manage to fend off the would-be assassin well enough until my guards arrive, and they take no chances when they reach me, cutting down the assassin. The dead woman apparently thought it was wise to carry her instructions with her, signed by none other than [courtier_murderer.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4612;Guards! I want this [chosen_courtier.GetManWoman] dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4612;Guards! I want this [chosen_courtier.GetManWoman] imprisoned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4613;I do my best to fight off the assassin, but even though the woman was careless enough for me to notice her approach she is far from unskilled, and she soon has fatally wounded me. My vision is already fading by the time that she slips out the window, well before the guards have reached me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4613;Was... [chosen_courtier.GetBestName] behind... this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4614;Who... hired her?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4614;I do my best to fight off the assassin, but she is far from unskilled and fatally wound me with ease. As I collapse to the floor I see her reach the entrance to a hidden passageway, where [courtier_murderer.GetBestName] is holding the door open for her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4614;You? No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4615;It seems [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] seems intent to make me regret not granting [FromFromFrom.GetHerHis] wish, seeing as I have learned that [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] seems to have been involved in the crafting of several orders that clearly are meant to make me look like a fool. Even worse, there is not enough evidence to act on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4615;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4616;I have received word from several provincial governors that they have received supposedly official edicts worded in an insulting fashion, clearly meant to harm their opinion of me. Though it is impossible to say for certain, the wording some parts of the edicts seems quite similar to some things [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] has written in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4616;Curse that [FromFromFrom.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4617;I have just received an official-looking edict supposedly written in the name of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven. The edict is written in a highly irregular manner, reading as if it was meant as an insult, and though I suspect a forgery at first it clearly bears the official seal of [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4617;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4618;The [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven currently imposes certain restrictions on me and my fellow vassals, supposedly for the good of the realm. However, I doubt that I am the only one who thinks that there are times when it would be beneficial for the realm if vassals had more rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4618;I should request more authority!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4618;My liege probably knows best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4619;[From.GetBestName], one of my vassals, has requested an audience with me, which I have granted as that felt appropriate. As soon as we were done with the initial pleasantries, [From.GetSheHe] brought up the matter of the current restrictions on my vassals' authority, suggesting that the realm might benefit from them gaining further rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4619;Perhaps I have been overly harsh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4619;I will give [From.GetHerHim] some Grace instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4619;I will grant him an Imperial Marriage instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4619;I will grant [husband_to_be.GetBestName] an Imperial Marriage instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_4619;I will grant {From.GetHerHim] a Favor instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_4619;Time to call in the Favor [From.GetSheHe] owes me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_SOH_4619;I will fire someone [From.GetSheHe] dislikes instead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTH_SOH_4619;I will deflect the issue, in various ways...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTI_SOH_4619;I think [From.GetSheHe] will accept a bribe instead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTJ_SOH_4619;Maybe I can get out of this with diplomacy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTK_SOH_4619;Maybe a threat would be effective?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTL_SOH_4619;Request denied!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4620;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, considers my request carefully for a moment before declaring that [From.GetSheHe] can see giving me and my fellow vassals further authority could help the realm. Before long, messengers have been dispatched to all parts of the realm, bringing word of what has happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4620;Exactly as I predicted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4621;[From.GetBestName] considers my request for a moment before stating that [From.GetSheHe] unfortunately cannot grant it. The [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven does however make it clear that the Dragon Throne owes me something, and states that I might request something else in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4621;I can think of some ways to use this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4622;[From.GetBestName] informs me that [From.GetSheHe] does not think it would be wise to grant my request at this time. [From.GetSheHeCap] does, however, feel that I am owed something by the Dragon Throne, and suggests a marriage to [bride_to_be.GetBestName]. I cannot reasonably refuse this offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4622;This could be most beneficial!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4623;[From.GetBestName] informs me that [From.GetSheHe] does not think it would be wise to grant my request at this time. [From.GetSheHeCap] does, however, feel that I am owed something by the Dragon Throne, and suggests arranging for [husband_to_be.GetBestName] to marry [bride_to_be.GetBestName]. I cannot reasonably refuse this offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4623;This could be most beneficial!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4624;After considering my request for a moment [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, says that [From.GetSheHe] would prefer not to grant it, making it clear that [From.GetSheHe] would owe me a Favor if I agree to withdraw the request. I can see no way to refuse this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4624;I can make good use of a Favor...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4625;I have barely finished making my request before [From.GetBestName] tells me that I am to withdraw it, as [From.GetSheHe] is owed a Favor by me and [From.GetSheHe] wants it to be repaid in this manner. Given that the terms as to what Favor I owed specified that [From.GetBestName] could choose the Favor, it is hard to refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4625;Unthinkable, even...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4626;I have just been informed that [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, apparently has no further need of my services. I suspect that this is due to some request that [FromFrom.GetBestName] made, though it is also possible that [FromFrom.GetSheHe asked for something else and my firing was a compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4626;Curse both their names!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4627;After listening to my request [From.GetBestName] asks for a moment to think about it. A short while later, the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven tells me that [From.GetSheHe] cannot grant my request, but that [From.GetSheHe] feels that [From.GetSheHe] could fire [councillor_to_fire.GetBestName] if it would please me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4627;That would be appreciated, yes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4628;[From.GetBestName] asks for some time to think on my request, and I retire to the quarters I have been granted at [From.GetHerHis] palace. A short while later, several servants arrive, carrying with them a substantial amount of money from the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, who regrets that [From.GetSheHe] cannot grant my request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4628;I can live with this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4629;[From.GetBestName] informs me that [From.GetSheHe] will consider the merits of my request, and that [From.GetSheHe] will get back to me when [From.GetSheHe] wishes to discuss it further. The [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven suggests I do not bring up the request again until this time. [From.GetSheHeCap] will send for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4629;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4630;After listening to my request the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven tells me that it is an interesting request but that it might be a good idea for me to withdraw it, providing me with several reasons why it might not be good for either me or the realm if it was granted. [From.GetSheHeCap] was quite convincing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4630;[From.GetSheHeCap] made some very good points!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4631;I do my best to come up with reasons as to why granting [From.GetBestName]'s request would not be a good idea, trying to avoid making it sound as if I am just saying it because it would be bad for me. When I have finished, [From.GetSheHe] immediately withdraws the request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4631;That actually worked?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4632;After listening to my request the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven tells me that it is an interesting request but that it might be a good idea for me to withdraw it, providing me with several reasons why it might not be good for either me or the realm if it was granted. [From.GetSheHeCap] was not remotely convincing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4632;I will ask again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4633;I do my best to come up with reasons as to why granting [From.GetBestName]'s request would not be a good idea, trying to avoid making it sound as if I am just saying it because it would be bad for me. When I have finished, [From.GetSheHe] repeats the request, clearly unconvinced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4633;Have it your way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4633;I will not grant your request!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4634;Having listened to my request, [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven suggests that it would displease [From.GetHerHim] greatly to hear that any vassal of [From.GetHerHis] insisted on making unreasonable requests. The implications were quite clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4634;[From.GetHerHisCap] anger would be terrible to behold...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4635;I told [From.GetBestName] that I do not wish to be bothered with unreasonable requests and that anyone approaching me with such requests risks my displeasure. [From.GetSheHeCap] clearly got the message, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] quickly decided to withdraw [From.GetHerHis] request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4635;That actually worked?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4636;Having listened to my request, [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven suggests that it would displease [From.GetHerHim] greatly to hear that any vassal of [From.GetHerHis] insisted on making unreasonable requests. Obviously, [From.GetSheHe] meant petitions by other vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4636;I will make my request again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4637;I told [From.GetBestName] that I do not wish to be bothered with unreasonable requests and that anyone approaching me with such requests risks my displeasure. I am uncertain whether the implications were unclear or whether [From.GetBestName] simply did not understand them, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] immediately repeated the initial request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4637;I suppose I can agree to it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4637;I will not grant your request!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4639;The [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven has seen fit to refuse my request. To be perfectly honest, I never really thought it would be accepted, so this is not much of a surprise, even if it would have been nice if it had been accepted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4639;Well, I tried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4640;[From.GetBestName] seems to have taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] request quite well, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] does not seem to even have complained about the matter in private.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4640;I suppose that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4641;The [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven has seen fit to refuse my request, even though it clearly would have been good for the realm as a whole if [From.GetSheHe] had accepted it. I have been a loyal subject, and I should receive better treatment than this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4641;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4642;[From.GetBestName] has not taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] request well, and has been complaining about it both in public and in private. It seems [From.GetSheHe] thinks that [From.GetHerHis] service has been exemplary, and that [From.GetSheHe] is entitled to certain benefits as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4642;I am not surprised...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4643;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap of Heaven, has not seen fit to grant my most reasonable request. I suppose it is possible that [From.GetSheHe] did not refuse this out of personal enmity, but in a way it feels personal, and maybe I should not forgive this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4643;[From.GetSheHeCap] has made an enemy this day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4643;I wouldn't go that far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4644;It seems [From.GetBestName] has taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] request very personally, as [From.GetSheHe] has been overheard claiming that it is clear that I do not respect [From.GetHerHim] and that [From.GetSheHe] feels that I wish for [From.GetHerHim] to be an enemy... and that [From.GetSheHe] is feels the same way about me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4644;This could be a problem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4645;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap of Heaven, has not seen fit to grant my most reasonable request. I would have thought that [From.GetSheHe] would have seen fit to grant this simple request, seeing as we are friends, but apparently [From.GetSheHe] does not consider that sufficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4645;[From.GetSheHeCap] is no friend of mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4645;I wouldn't go that far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4646;It seems [From.GetBestName] has taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] request very personally, as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] no longer considers me [From.GetHerHis] friend. I had thought that our friendship would have been sufficient to make [From.GetHerHim] accept my refusal gracefully, but apparently it was not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4646;Some "friend"...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4647;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has not seen fit to grant my most reasonable request. I would have thought that [From.GetSheHe] would have seen fit to grant it, seeing as we are lovers, but apparently [From.GetSheHe] does not consider that sufficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4647;[From.GetSheHeCap] clearly does not love me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4647;I wouldn't go that far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4648;It seems [From.GetBestName] has taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] request very personally, as [From.GetSheHe] has made it very clear that [From.GetSheHe] thinks I no longer love [From.GetHerHim], and that [From.GetSheHe] definitely feels the same way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4648;[From.GetSheHeCap] clearly never loved me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4649;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, refused to grant my request despite it being very much in the interest of the realm. Perhaps I should let everyone in the realm know that [From.GetSheHe] acts in a manner that is almost tyrannical?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4649;It is only fair...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4649;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4650;I have learned that [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to send forth messages informing the realm of my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] supposedly reasonable request. Doubtlessly, [From.GetSheHe] has framed those messages in a way that makes my refusal seem anything but reasonable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4650;This is not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4651;I have received a letter from [FromFrom.GetBestName] that the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven is acting in a manner that is almost tyrannical. Apparently, [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to refuse a request to ever so slightly increase the rights of [From.GetHerHis] vassals, despite [FromFrom.GetBestName] requesting only minor concessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4651;It was clearly a reasonable request!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4652;My very reasonable request has been refused by the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, despite me being a most faithful subject. I could very easily make [From.GetBestName] regret this by insisting that court protocols be followed to the letter, even if cases where [From.GetBestName] would benefit from that not being the case...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4652;[From.GetSheHeCap] deserves no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4652;I can't do this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4653;It seems [From.GetBestName] might not have taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] request well, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] seems to have taken steps to ensure that every single court protocol is followed to the letter, even in situations where doing so would be embarrassing or inconvenient for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4653;Curse [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4654;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has been convinced to grant further authority to the eunuchs at court. What this will mean for the realm is uncertain, but it certainly does not benefit me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4654;Eunuchs given more power? Worrying...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4655;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has been convinced to grant further authority to the Grand Chancellor, [FromFrom.GetBestName]. Just how the Grand Chancellor will use this authority still remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4655;Being the Grand Chancellor must be nice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4656;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has been convinced to grant further authority to various court bureaucrats and other influential courtiers. What this will mean for the realm is uncertain, but it certainly does not benefit me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4656;This might be trouble...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4657;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has been convinced to grant further authority to me and my fellow vassals. Whether this is what is best for the realm is unclear, but it certainly will benefit me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4657;What excellent news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
### Chinese infighting events
EVTDESC_SOH_4704;The current balance of power when it comes to different interest groups in the court of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven does not favor me as much as it could. Perhaps I could increase my own power by challenging one of the other interest groups?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_4707_A;[eunuch_challenger.GetBestName], an influential court eunuch, is apparently not content with the current balance of power at the court, and has seen fit to challenge the authority of my Grand Chancellor, [grand_chancellor.GetBestName], seeking to either become more powerful or to weaken my Grand Chancellor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4707_B;An influential court eunuch is apparently not content with the current balane of power at the court, and has seen fit to challenge the authority of my Grand Chancellor, [grand_chancellor.GetBestName], seeking to either become more powerful or to weaken my Grand Chancellor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4707;The eunuchs have my support!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4707;I will side with the Grand Chancellor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4707;I see no reason to get involved...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4707;I will secretly oppose them both!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_4707;I cannot get involved...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4708_A;An influential court eunuch at the court of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven is apparently not content with the current balance of power at court, and has seen fit to challenge my authority as Grand Chancellor. Even worse, [From.GetBestName] has sided with the eunuchs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4708_B;An influential court eunuch at the court of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven is apparently not content with the current balance of power at court, and has seen fit to challenge my authority as Grand Chancellor. However, [From.GetBestName] is siding with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4708_C;An influential court eunuch at the court of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven is apparently not content with the current balance of power at court, and has seen fit to challenge my authority as Grand Chancellor. [From.GetBestName] has not sided with either side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4708_D;An influential court eunuch at the court of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven is apparently not content with the current balance of power at court, and has seen fit to challenge my authority as Grand Chancellor. Naturally, [From.GetBestName] is unable to get involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4708;The [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's help won't be enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4708;I will not disappoint [From.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4708;I suppose that's fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4708;Hardly surprising!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4710_A;The eunuchs are presenting their best arguments as to why my authority should be decreased, or why their authority should be increased, and as the challenging party they can choose what to focus on. It seems they primarily are questioning whether I can handle disputes in a calm and rational manner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4710_B;The eunuchs are presenting their best arguments as to why my authority should be decreased, or why their authority should be increased, and as the challenging party they can choose what to focus on.

EVTDESC_SOH_4710_C;The eunuchs are presenting their best arguments as to why my authority should be decreased, or why their authority should be increased, and as the challenging party they can choose what to focus on.

EVTDESC_SOH_4710_D;The eunuchs are presenting their best arguments as to why my authority should be decreased, or why their authority should be increased, and as the challenging party they can choose what to focus on.

EVTDESC_SOH_4710_E;The eunuchs are presenting their best arguments as to why my authority should be decreased, or why their authority should be increased, and as the challenging party they can choose what to focus on.

EVTOPTA_SOH_4710;A foolish choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4710;I think I can deal with that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4710;That is hard for me to oppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4712;I have successfully managed to get both the court eunuchs and my Grand Chancellor to discredit one another in a convincing manner by asking the right questions at the right time while appearing as merely a neutral observer.

EVTDESC_SOH_4713;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has previously not gotten involved in my struggle against the eunuchs, aside from asking a few questions. However, [From.GetSheHe] has apparently just been biding [From.GetHerHis] time, as [From.GetSheHe] today announced that both sides have proven to be unworthy of the authority we possess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4713;How did I fail to see that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4714;Word has arrived from the court of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven that [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to decrease the authority of both the court eunuchs and [From.GetHerHis] Grand Chancellor, using the justification that their recent squabble has proven that both sides are unworthy of such authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4714;An interesting development...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4715;I have attempted to get both the court eunuchs and my Grand Chancellor to discredit each other sufficiently for me to weaken both sides. However, they seem to have caught on, as they now answer my questions much more carefully and make sure that the answer is not something that justifies my authority being increased at their expense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4715;Now they are all upset!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4716;Though the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven initially seemed to just be a neutral observer in my struggle against the eunuchs I have now been able to determine that [From.GetSheHe] seeks to weaken both sides. Judging by the way the eunuchs are acting, they also seem to have caught on to [From.GetBestName]'s deception.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4716;We won't forget this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4717;The ongoing struggle for power at court between the eunuchs and the Grand Chancellor has developed in an interesting manner, as rumour has it [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has attempted to play both sides against one another unsuccessfully. Regardless of who wins, [From.GetBestName] is unlikely to find them an ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4717;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4721;The eunuchs' attempt to challenge the authority of my Grand Chancellor has been successful in the eyes of the court, and it is time for me to officially reduce the Grand Chancellor's authority. Just what the consequences of this will be in the long term is still hard to determine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4721;This might actually increase my power somewhat...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4722;Despite giving it my all the eunuchs have managed to convince the court and the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven that I am unworthy of the authority I have had in the past as Grand Chancellor.

EVTDESC_SOH_4723;Following a recent power struggle at the court of [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, the eunuchs have managed to get the authority of the Grand Chancellor reduced.

EVTOPTA_SOH_4726;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4727;The eunuchs have failed to challenge my authority in the eyes of the court, and I am now in a position to either increase my own authority or weaken the position of the eunuchs. Both could be an advantage, though perhaps in different ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_5008;Though the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven initially seemed to just be a neutral observer in our struggle against the courtiers I have now been able to determine that [From.GetSheHe] seeks to weaken both sides. Judging by the way the courtiers are acting, they also seem to have caught on to [From.GetBestName]'s deception.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5008;We won't forget this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5009;The ongoing struggle for power at court between the courtiers and several vassals has developed in an interesting manner, as rumour has it [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has attempted to play both sides against one another unsuccessfully. Regardless of who wins, [From.GetBestName] is unlikely to find them an ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5009;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5011;I have successfully challenged the courtiers' authority in the eyes of the court, and I am now in a position to either increase my own authority or weaken the position of the courtiers. Both could be an advantage, though perhaps in different ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5011;I will increase my authority!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5011;I will weaken the courtiers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5012;The power struggle at court has ended with the courtiers discredited, and now it is time for me to officially weaken them. What this will mean for the balance of power at court and the realm as a whole still is unclear, especially in the long term.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5012;This might increase my power somewhat...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5013;The recent power struggle at the court of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven has ended with the courtiers discredited, and their authority has been weakened as a result. This does not directly increase my authority, but it is still to my benefit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5013;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5014;Following a recent power struggle at court the courtiers have been discredited, and as a result they have lost a considerable amount of influence. It is unclear what this will mean for the realm, but the other interest groups at court most likely will benefit from this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5014;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5015;[From.GetBestName], one of my vassals, has succeeded in proving that my vassals not only deserves the authority they had when [From.GetSheHe] challenged the courtiers, but also further authority. It is now time for me to make this official, come what may.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5015;This hurts my power somewhat...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5016;Thanks to the efforts of [FromFrom.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven has been forced to concede that me and my fellow vassals not only deserve the authority we had prior to this struggle but further authority on top of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5016;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5017;[FromFrom.GetBestName], the Grand Chancellor of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has managed to triumph in a power struggle against the courtiers, and has used [FromFrom.GetHerHis] victory to bolster [FromFrom.GetHerHis] authority even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5017;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5019;My vassals' attempt to challenge the authority of the courtiers has been unsuccessful in the eyes of the court, and it is time for me to officially reduce my vassals' authority. Just what the consequences of this will be in the long term is still hard to determine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5019;This might actually increase my power somewhat...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5020;Despite giving it my all the courtiers have managed to convince the court and the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven that I and my fellow vassals do not deserve the authority we have had in the past. This has not directly increased the courtiers' authority, but they have still gained from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5020;This is not good for me... or the realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5021;Despite giving it my all the courtiers have managed to convince the court and the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven that I and my fellow vassals do not deserve the authority we have had in the past.

EVTOPTA_SOH_5021;This is not good for me... or the realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5022;Following a recent power struggle at the court of [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, the courtiers have managed to get the authority of [From.GetBestName]'s vassals reduced. This will doubtlessly benefit other interest groups, even if they have not gained any additional authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5022;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5023;My vassals' attempt to challenge the authority of the courtiers has been unsuccessful in the eyes of the court, and it is time for me to officially grant the courtiers further authority. Just what the consequences of this will be in the long term is still hard to determine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_5024;Despite giving it my all the courtiers have managed to convince the court and the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven that they deserve further authority. This has not directly decreased my authority, but my position is comparatively weaker than it was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5024;This is not good for the realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5025;Despite giving it my all the courtiers have managed to convince the court and the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven that they deserve further authority. This has not directly decreased my authority, but my position is comparatively weaker than it was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5025;This is not good for the realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5026;Following a recent power struggle at the court of [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, the courtiers have managed to obtain further authority. This will doubtlessly be detrimental to other interest groups, even if they have not lost any authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5026;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
### Nuclear option events
EVTDESC_SOH_5102;The eunuchs at court are very influential at present, and many attempts to limit their influence have failed. Perhaps I should call in [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] to deal with the matter in a very direct fashion, even though [vassal_assisting.GetSheHe] might expect significant influence in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5102;I will call [vassal_assisting.GetHerHim] in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5102;I will call [vassal_assisting.GetHerHim] in... and betray [vassal_assisting.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5102;It would be too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5103;There are quite a few very influential courtiers at present, and many attempts to limit their influence have failed.

EVTDESC_SOH_5104;The eunuchs and several others at court are very influential at present, and many attempts to limit their influence have failed. Perhaps I should call in [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] to deal with the matter in a very direct fashion, even though [vassal_assisting.GetSheHe] might expect significant influence in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_SOH_5104;It would be too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5105;The current situation at court needs to change. At present, I believe [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] would be best suited for dealing with the matter, even though [vassal_assisting.GetSheHe] might expect significant influence in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5105;I will call [vassal_assisting.GetHerHim] in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_SOH_5105;It would be too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5106;A messenger has arrived in the dead of night, bringing a secret missive from [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven. Apparently the situation at court is such that [From.GetSheHe] wishes for me to gather an army to deal with a number of people that are far too powerful for [From.GetBestName]'s liking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5106;[From.GetBestName] will certainly reward me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5106;This sounds far too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5107;[From.GetBestName] has sent out a secret call to arms, requesting that I should gather my most trusted retainers to join [From.GetHerHim] in [From.GetHerHis] attempt to help [From.Liege.GetBestName], the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, deal with some troublesome members of [From.Liege.GetHerHis] court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5107;Of course I will help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5107;This is far too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5108;I have received word that [From.GetBestName] will be joining me in my attempt to help the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven deal with the situation at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5108;Together we are sure to triumph!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5109;I have received word that [From.GetBestName] has no intention of joining me in my attempt to help the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven deal with the situation at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5109;I don't need [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5110;The messenger I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned, bringing word that [From.GetSheHe] is gathering [From.GetHerHis] most trusted soldiers in secret to bring them to my court to help me with the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5110;Now I just need to wait...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5111;The messenger I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that [From.GetSheHe] is not prepared to help me with the situation at court. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] thinks it is far too risky to make such a move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5111;With subjects like these, who needs enemies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5112;The situation at the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's court is dire. The eunuchs have amassed a great deal of power, and they are using it in an unseemely fashion. It is clear they must be dealt with... permanently. Perhaps I could be the one that sees it done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5112;I will gather my forces at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5112;It would be far too dangerous...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5113;The [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's court is currently dominated by a number of powerful courtiers, and it is clear that they are abusing their authority. The realm would benefit from someone marching to the capital and dealing with these courtiers... permanently. Maybe I should take the initiative to see it done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5113;I will gather my forces at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5113;It would be far too dangerous...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5114;A number of powerful courtiers and eunuchs currently control the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's court, which is a state of affairs that clearly will not benefit the realm in the long term. Someone should lead an army to the capital and deal with these uppity courtiers and eunuchs... permanently.
EVTOPTA_SOH_5114;I will gather my forces at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5114;It would be far too dangerous...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5115;I have made the decision to gather my most loyal retainers to march to the capital of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven to deal with the situation at court. I expect to be duly compensated, of course, but everyone should see that I am doing this for the good of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5115;I am doing the realm a service!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5116;My liege, [From.GetBestName], has sent a message asking for me to gather my most trusted retainers to join [From.GetHerHim] in [From.GetHerHis] attempt to deal with certain troublesome elements at the court of the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5116;I will see to it at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5116;I will not take part in this fool's errand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5117;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] will be joining me in my attempt to deal with the situation at the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's court, along with [From.GetHerHis] most trusted retainers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5117;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5118;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] considers my attempt to deal with the situation at the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's court a fool's errand, and that [From.GetSheHe] will not be throwing away [From.GetHerHis] life in such a manner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5118;I expected better from [From.GetHerHim]!
EVTDESC_SOH_5119;A messenger arrived in the dead of night, and somehow made contact with some of my most trusted guards to pass on a missive from [From.GetBestName], informing me that [From.GetSheHe] is coming to the capital with an army to deal with certain troublesome elements at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5119;[From.GetBestName] has my support!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5119;I will play them against each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5119;I will oppose [From.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_5119;I can't get involved...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5121;I have arrived at the capital of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven with my most trusted retainers. Unfortunately, [Root.Liege.GetBestName] does not seem to understand that I am doing this for the good of the realm, seeing as [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] forces clearly are arrayed against me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5121;Someone else also needs to be dealt with...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5122;[From.GetBestName]'s forces have arrived at my capital, and my forces are ready to oppose them, alongside the forces loyal to certain interest groups at court. If [From.GetBestName] should prevail, I doubt [FRom.GetSheHe] will be happy about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5122;It is for the good of the realm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5123;It seems the troublesome elements at court have learned of my arrival at the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's court ahead of time, as their forces are arrayed against mine. It seems [Root.Liege.GetBestName]'s forces are not with them, however, which bodes well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5123;I can still win this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5124;[From.GetBestName]'s forces have arrived at my capital, ready to deal with certain troublesome elements at my court. It seems [From.GetHerHis] arrival was expected, however, as forces loyal to those same elements at court are arrayed against [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5124;I must help [From.GetHerHim] prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5124;Now we wait for the moment to strike...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5125;I have arrived at the capital of [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven with my forces, and it would seem my arrival has not been anticipated as there is only a token detachment of guards at the gates. They wisely throw down their weapons and step aside when they realize how outnumbered they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5125;Secure the palace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5126;[From.GetBestName]'s forces have arrived at my, and the outnumbered guards at the gates have seemingly stepped aside as there is already sounds of fighting coming from quite a bit further into the palace. The unexpected arrival of [From.GetBestName]'s forces might bode well for [From.GetHerHis] chances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5126;This might actually work out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5126;Now we wait for the moment to strike...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5126;This should be interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5128;The fighting in the palace continues. At the moment, the forces of [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] appear to be gaining the upper hand, though in the chaos it is hard to tell, particularly as a lot of it is taking place quite far from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5128;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5128;Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5128;This is getting out of hand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_5128;Time to spring my trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5130;The fighting inside the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven seems to be going well, and my forces seem to be prevailing on multiple fronts. Still, the fighting is chaotic, and it is impossible for me to personally oversee more than a small fraction of it, so the battle might still turn against me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5130; Keep the pressure on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5131;As the fighting continues my soldiers corner [cornered_rival.GetBestName] and a small detachment of [cornered_rival.GetHerHis] guards in a small room. The latter are swiftly dealt with, and my soldiers bring [cornered_rival.GetBestName] before me, knowing that I might wish to deal with [cornered_rival.GetHerHim] personally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5131;I will enjoy this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5131;Guards! Take [cornered_rival.GetHerHim] away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5132;In the middle of the fighting I come across [traitor_courtier.GetBestName] and a small detachment of guards holding [betrayed_courtier.GetBestName] captive. [traitor_courtier.GetBestName] offers to hand [betrayed_courtier.GetBestName] over to me, in exchange for me sparing [traitor_courtier.GetHerHim] if I prevail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5132;Very well. You will be spared!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5132;Guards! Seize them both!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5133;One of my soldiers comes running to inform me that a room containing what appears to be a large amount of tax money yet to be counted has been discovered. Much as I might wish otherwise, it would likely disappear into the hands of some less honest soldiers if I left it alone, so I know what must be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5133;Secure it, for the good of the realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5134;One of my soldiers approaches me and presents a small box containing a valuable item discovered during the fighting. Its owner will probably not like losing it, but I doubt they can be found, and the item certainly is far too valuable to just leave lying around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5134;I can find a use for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5135;The fighting at the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's palace is going well, and it seems [Root.Liege.GetBestName]'s commanders are realizingt this. One of them, [traitor_courtier.GetBestName], has requested a truce to negotiate [traitor_courtier.GetHerHis] defection to my side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5135;I welcome your fealty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5135;Guards! Imprison this traitor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5136;One of my messengers informs me that [traitor_courtier.GetBestName] has seen fit to betray my forces to align with [From.GetBestName]. Apparently [traitor_courtier.GetSheHe] must have failed to understand that my forces' current weakness merely is a temporary setback.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5136;It's treason, then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5137;One of my soldiers comes running to inform me that the location of my hated rival, [discovered_prisoner.GetBestName], has been determined and that [discovered_prisoner.GetSheHe] is only lightly guarded. It would be a simple matter to take a quick detour to see to it that [discovered_prisoner.GetSheHe] dies, if I so desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5137;Time for [discovered_prisoner.GetHerHim] to die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5137;[discovered_prisoner.GetSheHeCap] is where [discovered_prisoner.GetSheHe] belongs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5138;The sounds of fighting in the palace have been getting closer for quite some time and the guards outside have gone to investigate the situation. I hear the sound of footsteps approaching and expect to see the guards returning, but instead I discover that it is [From.GetBestName] that is coming my way, [From.GetHerHis] weapon at the ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5138;You? No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5139;One of my soldiers has informed me that the location of [discovered_prisoner.GetBestName] has been determined and that [discovered_prisoner.GetSheHe] only is lightly guarded at this time. It would not be difficult to rescue [discovered_prisoner.GetHerHim], if I so desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5139;I must release [discovered_prisoner.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5139;I have better things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5140;The guards that usually are nearby have disappeared to investigate the sound of fighting. They do not return, and the reason for this is obvious as soon as I discover that [From.GetBestName] has come to rescue me from captivity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5140;My thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5140;[From.GetSheHeCap] truly loves me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5141;[From.GetBestName] is clearly very happy to be rescued by me, and [From.GetSheHe] suggest that we should leave the fighting to my trusted commanders for the time being so that [From.GetSheHe] can thank me properly somewhere out of sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5141;I suppose we could find somewhere private...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5142;A messenger comes running, bringing word that [discovered_prisoner.GetBestName] apparently has escaped from captivity during the fighting in the palace. The circumstances surrounding this will probably never come to light, considering the ongoing chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5142;Did [discovered_prisoner.GetSheHe] escape on [discovered_prisoner.GetHerHis] own?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5143;I have been informed by one of my soldiers that the location of [discovered_prisoner.GetBestName] has been determined and that nearly all of [discovered_prisoner.GetHerHis] guards have been drawn away due to the ongoing fighting. It would be easy for me to free [discovered_prisoner.GetHerHim], if I so desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5143;I must release [discovered_prisoner.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5143;I need to focus on the fighting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5144;I am normally surrounded by quite a few guards loyal to the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, but they have been drawn away by the ongoing fighting. To my great surprise and pleasure, this has made it possible for [From.GetBestName] to free me from captivity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5144;My thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5145;A messenger comes running and informs me that [discovered_prisoner.GetBestName] is nowhere to be found. [discovered_prisoner.GetSheHeCap] seems to have managed to slip away in the chaos of the fighting, and just how that happened will probably never be determined.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5145;Did someone help [discovered_prisoner.GetHerHim], perhaps?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5146;Fighting side by side with [commander_friend.GetBestName] against our common foes in the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's palace has been a bonding experience. I find that I can trust [commander_friend.GetHerHim] to do whatever it takes to see this through, and I feel that I have made a friend for life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5146;Together we are unstoppable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5147;Fighting side by side with [From.GetBestName] against our common foes in the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's palace has been a bonding experience. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems determined to do whatever it takes to see this through for the good of the realm, and I feel that I have made a friend for life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5147;Together we are unstoppable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5148;With the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's forces fighting alongside mine, it is only natural that I have had to work together with some of [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] commanders. One of them, [commander_friend.GetBestName], has been quite helpful and quite courteous, and I feel that I have made a friend for life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5148;Together we are unstoppable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5149;The fighting goes on at the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's palace, and it is going quite well at present. However, I discover more and more of [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] forces amassing nearby, seemingly waiting for something. I consider the matter in the back of my head for a while before arriving at the only logical answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5149;It's a trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5150;A messenger comes running, breaking protocol and interrupting an ongoing meeting, and for a very understandable reason. Apparently [From.GetBestName] has discovered my gathering forces and has realized that I am planning to turn against [From.GetHerHim], and [From.GetSheHe] has taken the opportunity to strike first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5150;Why did I not plan for this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5151;The fighting at my palace continues. At present, the forces of various powerful individuals at my court seem to be prevailing, though it is possible things will change as the fighting continues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5151;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5151;Good! Good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5151;Not as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_5151;Time for me to enter the fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5153;Things are not going so well in the fighting at the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's palace at present, and my forces are clearly losing on several fronts while the forces of certain powerful individuals at court are gaining ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5153;This is merely a temporary setback!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5154;The fighting at the palace of the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's palace is not going well at the moment, and it might be time to consider whether removing [From.GetBestName] from the picture and arranging a surrender would be a wise course of action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5154;It's time to save my own skin...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5154;I will not betray my liege!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5156;In the middle of the fighting at [Root.Liege.GetBestName]'s palace [traitor_vassal.GetBestName] approaches me with [traitor_vassal.GetHerHis] weapon drawn.\n"We have clearly lost," [traitor_vassal.GetSheHe] says. "I think presenting your head to our foes would greatly please them.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5156;It's treason, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5157;[traitor_vassal.GetBestName] fights well, but not well enough, and I gain the upper hand as my more loyal forces keep [traitor_vassal.GetHerHis] forces from interfering. Before long, I land the killing blow on my traitorous vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5157;Thus, always, to traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5158;I fight as well as I can against [From.GetBestName], but my best is not good enough, and soldiers loyal to [From.GetBestName] keep my own soldiers from coming to my rescue. Before long, I am overcome, and [From.GetBestName] lands a fatal blow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5158;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5159;My forces keep the forces of [traitor_vassal.GetBestName] at bay as I fight [traitor_vassal.GetHerHim], but though I fight as well as I possibly can I cannot prevail. Before long, I take a fatal wound, and [From.GetBestName] moves in to finish me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5159;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5160;[From.GetBestName] puts up a good fight, but [From.GetSheHe] is no match for me, and before long I land a killing blow. Understanding just how perilous our situation is, [From.GetBestName]'s former commanders turn to me for instructions, and I quickly dispatch a messenger to our foes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5160;We surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5161;I have just received word that [traitor_vassal.GetBestName], realizing that [vassal_assisting.GetBestName]'s forces could not prevail, has seen fit to kill [traitor_vassal.GetHerHis] former liege to present [vassal_assisting.GetHerHis] head to those powerful individuals at court that [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] sought to eliminate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5161;How unexpected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5161;But that means...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5162;The small detachment of troops I am in command of in the fighting at the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's palace has been struggling for some time, and though we have tried to regroup with forces loyal to [From.GetBestName] we are cut off. My soldiers fight valiantly, but we are overcome, and our foes show no mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5162;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5163;I have just learned that a detachment of troops commanded by [From.GetBestName] has been surrounded and destroyed by forces loyal to various powerful elements at the court of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven. Not even [From.GetBestName] was spared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5163;Not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5164;Though I have done my best to stay away from the frontlines at the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's palace the highly irregular battlefield has made it possible for some of my enemies to attack from unexpected directions several times. One such surprise attack got quite close to me, and though I survived I was badly injured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5164;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5165;I am doing my best to avoid the chaotic fighting at court, moving quickly from one safe location to another. As I walk past a group of courtiers going the other way I feel a sharp pain in my side, and as I touch it my hand comes away wet with blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5165;Who...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5166;As the fighting continues at the palace of [Root.Liege.GetBestName] one of my soldiers brings me unwelcome news. It seems that not only are we losing on several fronts, but [From.GetBestName] has been found dead ine one of the hallways, bearing a wound that seems to have been inflicted with a knife or dagger rather than the weapon of a soldier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5166;Who did this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5167;The fighting at the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap]'s palace continues, and it is not going well. Even worse, [Root.Liege.GetBestName]'s forces seem to be amassing nearby, clearly waiting for something. I am quite sure I know what is going on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5167;It's a trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5168;A messenger comes running, breaking protocol and interrupting an ongoing meeting, and for a very understandable reason. Apparently [From.GetBestName] has discovered my gathering forces and has realized that I am planning to turn against [From.GetHerHim], and [From.GetSheHe] has taken the opportunity to strike first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5168;Why did I not plan for this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5169;[vassal_assisting.GetBestName] and the powerful individuals [vassal_assisting.GetSheHe] has been fighting are all too preoccupied with each other to notice my forces getting into position before I give the signal, and they are caught unawares by my initial attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5169;Fools! I will destroy you all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5170;As I continue the fight against the forces of various powerful individuals at the court of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven a messenger comes running, bringing word that the forces of [Root.Liege.GetBestName] have joined the fight, and that they seem equally inclined to destroy my forces and those of my foes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5170;It's a trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5171;The fighting at my palace is going quite well. My forces are advancing on several fronts, and the forces of [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] and those of several powerful individuals at court are falling back before them while still fighting against each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5171;None can stand against the Dragon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5173;The fighting at the palace of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven is not going well, and [Root.Liege.GetBestName]'s forces seem to be gaining the upper hand at the moment. Worse, my other foes are still fighting as hard against me as they previously did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5173;We must keep fighting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5174;The [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's forces seem to be gaining the upper hand in the fighting at [From.Liege.GetHerHis] palace. If I were to kill [From.GetBestName] and turn over [From.GetHerHis] head, I might be greatly rewarded... or I would at least increase my chances of surviving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5174;I need to save my own skin...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5174;I will not betray my liege!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5176;As my forces struggle against those of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven [From.GetBestName] readies [From.GetHerHis] weapon and heads towards me.\n"You have lost," [From.GetSheHe] says. "Presenting your head to the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven should result in a nice reward!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SOH_5176;It's treason, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5177;I engage [traitor_vassal.GetBestName] while my forces keep [traitor_vassal].GetHerHim] forces from interfering. [traitor_vassal.GetBestName] puts up a good fight, but is unable to prevail, and I manage to inflict a killing wound easily enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5177;Thus, always, to traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5178;I engage [From.GetBestName], fighting as well as I possibly can. Unfortunately, this is not nearly good enough, and though my forces attempt to come to my rescue they are unable to do so. Before long, I have taken a fatal wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5178;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5179;My forces keep [traitor_vassal.GetBestName]'s forces at bay as we fight, but even so the fight goes against me. I soon take a fatal wound, and [traitor_vassal.GetBestName] moves in to finish me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5179;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5180;[From.GetBestName] puts up a good fight, but [From.GetSheHe] is no match for me, and I land a killing blow quickly enough. Seeing the way the wind is blowing, [From.GetHerHis] forces look to me for orders, and I give the only sensible orders anyone could give in my position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5180;We surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5181;A messenger comes running, informing me that [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to kill [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] and surrender to my forces, clearly realizing that the fight had been lost. Of course, I will have to spare [From.GetBestName] now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5181;I suppose I can work with this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5182;As the fighting continues the forces of the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven manage to surround me and a small number of my soldiers. Knowing that we cannot escape them, the enemy commander offers us the chance to surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5182;I will never yield to the likes of you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5182;I yield! I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5183;A messenger comes running, bearing word that [From.GetBestName] has been surrounded and killed after [From.GetSheHe] refused to surrender to my forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5183;[From.GetSheHeCap] deserved no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5184;A messenger comes running, bearing word that [From.GetBestName] and a detachment of troops under [From.GetHerHis] command have been killed by the forces of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5184;At least [From.GetSheHe] fought to the end...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5185;A messenger comes running, bearing word that [From.GetBestName] has been captured by my forces. It seems [From.GetSheHe] choose to yield rather than fighting to the bitter end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5185;I will deal with [From.GetHerHim] later!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5186;A messenger comes running, bearing word that [From.GetBestName] and a detachment of troops under [From.GetHerHis] command have been captured by the forces of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5186;[From.GetSheHeCap] should have died fighting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5187;With my forces fighting a losing battle against both the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's forces and those of my other foes at [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] court, I might be able to do better if I focus my forces on one foe for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5187;I will not let [Root.Liege.GetBestName] win!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5187;[Root.Liege.GetBestName] is more likely to show me mercy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5188;It seems [From.GetBestName] has decided to focus [From.GetHerHis] attention on my forces at present, seemingly thinking that I am a greater threat to [From.GetHerHim] than [From.GetHerHis] other foes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5188;I am not surprised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5189;It seems [From.GetBestName], while still trying to prevail against my forces, has decided to focus [From.GetHerHis] attention on our common foes at present, possibly thinking that that will let [From.GetHerHim] prevail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5189;Let them destroy each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5190;The forces loyal to the eunuchs are about to win against those of [vassal_assisting.GetBestName]. Unless I order my forces into the battle now the eunuchs will be able to reorganize their forces to thwart anything I might try later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5190;You think you've won? Fools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5190;I should order my forces to stand down...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_5194;Despite giving it all I and the soldiers at my command are unable to prevail, and the eunuchs' forces cut off our escape and take us captive.\nI am brought before [killing_me.GetBestName], disarmed, bound, and gagged. He looks at me in silence for a moment before speaking.\n"Did you really think you could oppose us with such a paltry force?" he asks. "The [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, and the realm as a whole, will not shed a tear for a fool like you."\nHe pulls free a dagger and thrusts it into my stomach, then turns around and leaves, no doubt knowing my death will not be quick.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Regardless of whether there is any truth to that or not, it seems the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven was killed in the fighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5217;How "convenient"...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5218;The End of the Fighting;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5218;The forces of the eunuchs and various influential courtiers have prevailed against those of [vassal_assisting.GetBestName], and [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] and [vassal_assisting.GetHerHis] supporters have been executed on charges of high treason.\nThe winners are not exactly pleased with the fact that my forces did not support theirs, but though they make it clear that I am in no position to oppose certain changes that will favor them they do not appear to be considering any kind of punitive measures directed against me or anyone close to me. Still, this victory is perhaps not good news for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5218;Maybe this will hurt the realm...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5219;Victory at Court;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5219;My forces fight side by side with those of several influential courtiers and those of the eunuchs, and [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] and [vassal_assisting.GetHerHis] supporters are unable to oppose us for long. They are all captured and executed, having been found guilty of high treason.\nI had expected my allies to be pleased by my support and that they would consider my wishes as a result, but they quickly make it clear that they expect several concessions to be made, and with their forces positioned as they are I know that it would be suicidal to not accept their demands.\nTheir will be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5219;I'm sure this will work out!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5220;News From Court;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5220;Word has arrived from the palace of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's palace that [vassal_assisting.GetBestName]'s attempt to exterminate a number of troublesome elements at court has failed, and that [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] and [vassal_assisting.GetHerHis] supporters have all been executed, having been found guilty of high treason.\nIn addition to this, the troublesome elements at court have taken the opportunity to further extend their own authority at the expense of other groups, which is detrimental for me and many others.\nPerhaps a more skilled commander than [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] could have prevailed...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5220;Worrying...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5221;Victory At Court;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5221;My forces have prevailed against the troublesome elements at the court of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's court, and the last enemy holdouts have thrown down their weapons and surrendered.\nThough there probably always will be those who will question my right to march into the palace of [Root.Liege.GetBestName] with an army, those who know what I know will understand that I was in no position to do anything else.\nThe realm will of course benefit greatly from my victory, as will I, considering the extensive authority I will possess as Grand Chancellor. How I choose to use this authority is of course up to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5221;An auspicious day!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5222;Due to [From.GetHerHis] victory against treasonous elements at the court of the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven [From.GetBestName] has been named Grand Chancellor by [From.Liege.GetBestName]. This of course means I am no longer the Grand Chancellor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5222;I should have intervened myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5223;Victory At Court;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5223;I did not win this victory on my own, of course, and in addition to making sure that my soldiers are paid properly it might be prudent to reward notable individuals who fought at my side, seeing as they no doubt expect some kind of reward from me and that it is possible I will have further need of their loyalty.\nOf course, there are those that would say that simply doing your duty and serving the realm is not something that deserves any particularly notable reward, so I could opt to not hand out any rewards.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5223;They all deserve a Favor!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5223;They all deserve some gold!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5223;They only did their duty!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5224;Victory At Court;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5224;[From.GetBestName] has prevailed against various troublesome elements at the court of the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven with my help and that of several other commanders, and of course a large number of common soldiers.\nIn addition to making sure that all of our soldiers are properly paid, [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to grant me and the other individuals of note that fought alongside [From.GetHerHim] a Favor, giving us some freedom when it comes to selecting a future reward.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5224;A suitable reward!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5225;Victory At Court;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5225;[From.GetBestName] has prevailed against various troublesome elements at the court of the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven with my help and that of several other commanders, and of course a large number of common soldiers.\nIn addition to making sure that all of our soldiers are properly paid, [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to grant me and the other individuals of note that fought alongside [From.GetHerHim] a substantial amount of gold, to be spent as we desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5225;I can find a use for this...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5226;Victory At Court;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5226;[From.GetBestName] has prevailed against various troublesome elements at the court of the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven with my help and that of several other commanders, and of course a large number of common soldiers.\nThough [From.GetBestName] has seen to it that all of the soldiers that supported [From.GetHerHim] have been paid properly, it seems [From.GetSheHe] does not feel that I or the other individuals of note that assisted [From.GetHerHim] deserve anything other than a brief acknowledgement that we have done our duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5226;I deserve more than empty words!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5228;[to_be_dealt_with.GetBestName] is brought before me for judgement. [to_be_dealt_with.GetSheHeCap] obviously has some connection to the troublesome elements at the court of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's court, but I can of course show mercy if I do not feel [to_be_dealt_with.GetHerHis] involvement was significant.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5228;Traitors die!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5228;You will be imprisoned!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5228;I don't consider you an enemy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5230;Victory At Court;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5230;[From.GetBestName] has won against various troublesome elements at court with my assistance, and even now [From.GetSheHe] is dealing with [From.GetHerHis] surviving enemies.\nThough I assisted [From.GetHerHim] in the fighting, it is clear [From.GetBestName] deserves a substantial reward, so in addition to greatly reducing the influence of various groups at court [From.GetSheHe] has received broad authority as Grand Chancellor, and my various vassals have been given a freer hand as well.\nHopefully, this benefits the realm more than it benefits [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5230;I guess I will find out...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5231;The [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5231;Various forces loyal to the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven took no part in the fighting against various troublesome elements at [From.GetHerHis] court despite being in position to do so, presumably due to not receiving any orders to that effect.\nIt is possible [Root.Liege.GetBestName] simply did not want to get in my way, or that [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] simply was unable to send the relevant orders in time, but it is also possible [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] was keeping them back for a less benign reason.\nPerhaps I should take certain steps, for the good of the realm...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5231;[Root.Liege.GetSheHeCap] is not my enemy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5231;[Root.Liege.GetSheHeCap] should be imprisoned!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5232;[vassal_assisting.GetTitledFirstName]'s Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5232;[From.GetBestName] has won the fight against various troublesome elements at my court, and in addition to significantly reducing the influence of those groups I have granted [From.GetHerHim] considerable authority as Grand Chancellor and have also granted several concessions to my various vassals.\nThough my forces did not take any part in the fighting, it seems [From.GetBestName] has decided not to hold this against me, even though I am sure a lesser [From.GetManWoman] would. My position might, on the whole, be stronger than it was before [From.GetSheHe] intervened.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5232;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5233;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5233;[From.GetBestName] has won the fight against various troublesome elements at my court, and in addition to significantly reducing the influence of those groups I have granted [From.GetHerHim] considerable authority as Grand Chancellor and have also granted several concessions to my various vassals.\nIt seems as if this is insufficient to convince [From.GetBestName] that I approve of [From.GetHerHis] victory, however, as [From.GetSheHe] has decided to view my neutrality as opposition.\n"Take the [Root.GetSonDaughterCap] someplace safe," [From.GetSheHe] orders [From.GetHerHis] guards. "I have a realm to manage in [Root.GetHerHis] absence.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5233;This is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5234;The [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5234;The forces of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven fought against my forces before my victory at [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] palace, and I rather doubt it was all a misunderstanding.\nFor the good of the realm, I have given the order to transfer all the money in [Root.Liege.GetBestName]'s treasury into mine, as well as for a number of titles to be granted to me and my descendants in perpetuity. Some will no doubt see this as unjustifiable, but I think everyone would have done the same in my position.\nOf course, in addition to this I need to deal with the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5234;[Root.Liege.GetSheHeCap] should be imprisoned!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5234;[Root.Liege.GetSheHeCap] has outlived [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] usefulness!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5235;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5235;Though my forces fight bravely, they are not able to overcome those of [From.GetBestName].\nAt first, I hope that granting [From.GetBestName] extensive authority as my Grand Chancellor and giving all vassals more freedom will placate [From.GetHerHim], but it does not seem to impress [From.GetHerHim] sufficiently, and [From.GetSheHe] soon makes [From.GetHerHis] desires clear.\n"I think the realm would benefit from being restructured a bit," [From.GetSheHe] tells me. "I will also require all available funds." [From.GetSheHeCap] pauses for a moment, then turns to [From.GetHerHis] soldiers. "Oh, and take the [Root.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven someplace safe.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5235;This is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5236;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5236;Though my forces fight bravely, they are not able to overcome those of [From.GetBestName].\n"It is clear that the future prosperity of the realm will require quite a few changes," [From.GetSheHe] tells me when [From.GetSheHe] approaches me. [From.GetSheHeCap] hands over several documents. "These need the [Root.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's seal."\nSeeing no other option, I make the documents official, granting [From.GetBestName] extensive authority as Grand Chancellor and a number of other concessions.\n"Excellent," [From.GetBestName] says when I am done. "I have no further need of you." With that, [From.GetSheHe] pulls free a dagger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5236;But I gave you everything you wanted!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5237;[vassal_assisting.GetTitledFirstName]'s Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5237;Word has arrived from the court of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven that [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] and [vassal_assisting.GetHerHis] supporters have prevailed against various troublesome elements at court.\nIt seems [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] has been richly rewarded by [From.GetBestName], being granted broad authority as Grand Chancellor and also receiving assurances that [vassal_assisting.GetSheHe] and [vassal_assisting.GetHerHis] fellow vassals will have a freer hand from now on.\nWhether this will result in the realm prospering or in interesting times still remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5237;Perhaps this will benefit me...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5238;[vassal_assisting.GetTitledFirstName]'s Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5238;Word has arrived from the court of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven that [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] and [vassal_assisting.GetHerHis] supporters have prevailed against various troublesome elements at court.\n[vassal_assisting.GetBestName] has been richly rewarded by [From.GetBestName], being granted broad authority as Grand Chancellor and also receiving assurances that the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven will intervene less in local affairs.\nHowever, despite this, it seems [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] was dissatisfied with [From.GetBestName]'s rewards, seeing as [vassal_assisting.GetSheHe] has imprisoned the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_5239;Word has arrived from the court of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven that [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] and [vassal_assisting.GetHerHis] supporters have prevailed against various troublesome elements at court.\n[vassal_assisting.GetBestName] has been richly rewarded by [From.GetBestName], being granted broad authority as Grand Chancellor along with several other rewards, including a promise of less interference in local affairs.\nHowever, [vassal_assisting.GetBestName]'s messenger also brings word that this was the last official decree of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven before [From.GetHerHis] unexpected death.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5239;How "convenient"...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5240;The Will of Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5240;The fighting at my palace is over, and my forces are triumphant, having defeated both the forces of [From.GetBestName] and the forces of those [From.GetSheHe] expected to be [From.GetHerHis] only opposition.\nWith this victory, I am in a position to finally bring various troublesome elements at court to heel, to restrict the authority of my various vassals, and to depower my Grand Chancellor.\nLet all remember this day as an auspicious one, as it saw the [Root.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven triumph over [Root.GetHerHis] foes and saw [Root.GetHerHis] authority increased substantially as a result!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5240;Assuming direct control!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5241;The [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5241;The fighting at the palace of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] has not gone well, as [From.GetHerHis] forces have triumphed against all others. Escape is impossible, and those who yet live area captured by [From.GetBestName]'s forces.\nAt the moment, it is unclear what our fate will be, but the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven seems to have declared that we are all guilty of treason, and based on what our guards have been speaking about it seems the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's authority has been increased substantially, to the detriment of all others.\nPerhaps the realm will benefit from this day, but I will probably not.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5241;This did not go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5242;The Will of Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5242;Though [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] doubtlessly would argue that [vassal_assisting.GetSheHe] only meant to do what was best for the realm and was not seeking personal power, many of [vassal_assisting.GetHerHis] captured soldiers have claimed otherwise. It is clear [vassal_assisting.GetSheHe] is too dangerous to trust.\nGiven my recent victory, none would dare question my will when it comes to how best to deal with [vassal_assisting.GetBestName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] must of course be weakened, but whether [From.GetSheHe] should be executed as a warning to others remains to be decided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5242;[vassal_assisting.GetSheHeCap] gets to live, for now...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5242;[vassal_assisting.GetSheHeCap] is to dangerous to leave alive!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_5243;"The [From.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, [From.GetBestName], has, in [From.GetHerHis] infinite benevolence, decided to be merciful," a servant informs me shortly after I have been taken to a prison cell beneath [From.GetBestName]'s palace.\n"Your titles will be reduced, but the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven has decreed that you will not be executed for your treason," the servant continues. "Truly, [From.GetSheHe] is a merciful and just ruler, the likes of which the realm has never seen. May [From.GetHerHis] reign last for ten thousand years!";;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_5244;I have received word that [From.GetBestName]'s forces have triumped against the forces of various troublesome elements at court and those of [vassal_assisting.GetBestName], whose intentions at court supposedly were less pure than [vassal_assisting.GetSheHe] seems to have claimed.\nThe [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven is merciful, however, and has decided to merely imprison [vassal_assisting.GetBestName].\nI have also been informed that the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's authority has increased significantly due to [From.GetHerHis] victory, to the detriment of many others.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_5245;"The [From.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, [From.GetBestName], has, in [From.GetHerHis] infinite wisdom, decided your fate," a servant informs me shortly after I have been taken to a prison cell beneath [From.GetBestName]'s palace.\n"Your titles will be reduced, and you will pay for this treason with your life," the servant continues.

EVTOPTA_SOH_5246;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5248;[to_be_dealt_with.GetBestName] is brought before me in chains. [to_be_dealt_with.GetSheHeCap] has obvious ties to the troublesome elements at court that were defeated, though I can of course decide to ignore those if I do not feel that [to_be_dealt_with.GetSheHe] deserves to be punished.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_SOH_5249;Betrayal Most Foul;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5249;I have just received word that [traitor_vassal.GetBestName], seeing the way the wind was blowing, has seen fit to kill [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] and present [vassal_assisting.GetHerHis] head to my soldiers in exchange for mercy.\nThis mercy does of course not need to extend to anyone else that supported [vassal_assisting.GetBestName], but though I will be able to use this victory to weaken various interest groups at court it is clear that I will not be able to use it to also impose further restrictions on my vassals, as that would be most unwise at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5249;I suppose it still is an improvement...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5250;Betrayal Most Foul;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5250;In the middle of the fighting [traitor_vassal.GetBestName] attacks [vassal_assisting.GetBestName], and though [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] fights back [vassal_assisting.GetSheHe] is overcome.\n[traitor_vassal.GetBestName] offers [From.GetBestName]'s forces our surrender in exchange for mercy, which is accepted. However, I and many others soon discover that this mercy only extends to [traitor_vassal.GetBestName] as we are quickly disarmed and brought to the dungeons of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5250;This could be bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5251;Betrayal Most Foul;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5251;Word from court is that [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has defeated the forces of several troublesome elements at court and those of [vassal_assisting.GetBestName], though apparently the latter only happened due to the betrayal of [traitor_vassal.GetBestName].\nThough the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven has managed to increase [From.GetHerHis] own authority as a result of this, [traitor_vassal.GetBestName]'s assistance seems to have assured that the rights of [From.GetBestName]'s vassals remain the same as before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5251;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5252;Betrayal Most Foul;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5252;[traitor_vassal.GetBestName] clearly expects to be rewarded for presenting the head of [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] to my soldiers and thus assuring my victory, and I have to admit that it is possible that [traitor_vassal.GetSheHe] did me a service.\nOf course, [traitor_vassal.GetBestName] did betray [traitor_vassal.GetHerHis] liege, and though it was to my benefit and that of the realm it potentially sets a dangerous precedent to reward a traitor, especially as I do not know if [traitor_vassal.GetBestName] truly is loyal to me or merely sought to save [traitor_vassal.GetHerHis] own skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_5258;"The [From.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, [From.GetBestName], has, in [From.GetHerHis] infinite wisdom, decreed that there will be no futher reward for killig [vassal_assisting.GetBestName]," a servant informs me, much to my surprise.\n"[vassal_assisting.GetBestName] was a traitor, of course, but [From.GetSheHe] believes that sparing your life is sufficient," the servant continues. "Truly, [From.GetSheHe] is a merciful and just ruler, the likes of which the realm has never seen. May [From.GetHerHis] reign last for ten thousand years!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5258;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5260;[to_be_dealt_with.GetBestName] is brought before me in chains. [to_be_dealt_with.GetSheHeCap] has obvious ties to the troublesome elements at court that were defeated, though I can of course decide to ignore those if I do not feel that [to_be_dealt_with.GetSheHe] deserves to be punished.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5260;Traitors like you deserve no mercy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5260;You will be imprisoned for your crimes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5260;I know you never were my enemy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5261;Trouble at Court;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5261;I have just received word that [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] has marched to the palace of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven at the head of a large force of [vassal_assisting.GetHerHis] most trusted retainers, supposedly in order to deal with troublesome elements at court in a permanent fashion.\nIt is well known that [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] considers certain elements at [From.GetBestName]'s court to be troublesome, it is also very possible that [vassal_assisting.GetSheHe] is doing this to increase [vassal_assisting.GetHerHis] own power.\nWhether the attempt will succeed or fail remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5261;Interesting times...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5262;Defeat at Court;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5262;In the middle of the fighting [traitor_vassal.GetBestName] attacks [vassal_assisting.GetBestName], and though [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] fights back [vassal_assisting.GetSheHe] is overcome.\n[traitor_vassal.GetBestName] offers [vassal_assisting.GetBestName]'s head to our foes in exchange for mercy, and the offer is accepted.\nHowever, it quickly becomes clear that the mercy only extends to [traitor_vassal.GetBestName], as I am disarmed, bound, and gagged, and then dragged before [killing_me.GetBestName].\n"You should never have come here," [killing_me.GetSheHe] says, thrusting a dagger into my stomach.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5262;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5263;Without warning, [traitor_vassal.GetBestName] attacks [From.GetBestName], declaring that we have lost the fight and that presenting [From.GetBestName]'s head to our foes is the only way to guarantee our survival. [From.GetBestName] is able to prevail, however, and it is [traitor_vassal.GetBestName] who ends up dying.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5263;I should not underestimate [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
### Council Eunuch events
EVTDESC_SOH_5305;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has several guard regiments at [From.GetHerHis] direct command. However, considering the influence I and the other Council Eunuchs possess, it might be possible to change things in our favor...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5305;The [guard_regiment_commander.PrimaryTitle.GetName] should be under eunuch supervision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5305;We have no need of guard regiments!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5306;It seems [From.GetBestName] believes that the [guard_regiment_commander.PrimaryTitle.GetName] would benefit from being under direct eunuch supervision, and that he has considerable support for this idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5306;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5306;I wish I could oppose this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5306;I can't get involved...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5308;The eunuchs wield considerable influence at my court, and this has at times made them troublesome to deal with. However, at the moment they seem quite pleased with the influence they wield, and with me as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5308;For once they are pleased...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5309;Seeing as they wield a non-negligible amount of influence at my court, the eunuchs are looked up to in a way by some people, even though the primary job requirement makes it somewhat unlikely that others aspire to take their place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5309;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5310;A minor eunuch at court by the name of [skilled_eunuch.GetBestName] has apparently been impressing other, more influential eunuchs, with his skills. They are now suggesting that he should be given a spot on my council, for the good of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5310;An excellent idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5310;I have no need of him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5312;[From.GetBestName, my liege, has a fairly large treasury. As a Council Eunuch, I have the authority to ensure that some of [From.GetHerHis] wealth is diverted where it would make the most good... such as in my pockets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5312;It's my money now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5312;I don't need it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5313;It seems [From.GetBestName] has used his considerable influence to divert a significant amount of funds from my treasury, supposedly framing it as a move that would be beneficial to the realm as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5313;If only he had less influence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5315;[From.GetBestName], my liege, does not wield as much influence as would be expected of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven. As such, [From.GetSheHe] does perhaps not deserve my respect, or the respect of others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5315;The [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven does not deserve respect!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5315;Actually, I think [From.GetSheHe] does...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5316;It seems [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to use his considerable influence to discredit me and my rule. Unfortunately, the way he approached the matter makes it impossible for me to punish him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5316;Curse him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5317;The influence the eunuchs wield at my court is quite considerable. This reflects poorly on me, and has also made many other influential people quite upset with my inability to keep the eunuchs under control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5317;Not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5318;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, is unable to keep the eunuchs at [From.GetHerHis] court under control. This is very improper, and very inauspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5318;Someone should do something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5320;[quarreling_eunuch.GetBestName], one of the more influential eunuchs at [From.GetBestName]'s court, has never been a friend of mine, and of late he has been going out of his way to antagonize me. His recent actions have been unforgiveable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5320;You have made an enemy for life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5321;It seems [quarreling_eunuch.GetBestName] has been getting on [From.GetBestName]'s nerves quite a bit recently, seeing as [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to declare that [quarreling_eunuch.GetBestName] is [From.GetHerHis] enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5321;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5323;[quarreling_eunuch.GetBestName] and the other eunuchs have been flaunting their extensive influence rather blatantly recently. As a result, my other councillors seem to have started to dislike the eunuchs quite a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5323;Perhaps this helps me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5324;[quarreling_eunuch.GetBestName] and his fellow eunuchs have been acting quite rudely of late, flaunting their influence in a most blatant manner. I cannot stand the sight of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5324;They should know their place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5326;[From.GetBestName], my liege, is a good friend of mine. Seeing as I have some influence at court, I could perhaps help [From.GetHerHim] out by giving [From.GetHerHim] a Favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5326;[From.GetSheHeCap] deserves a Favor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5326;Actually, I think not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5327;It seems [From.GetBestName] truly values our friendship, seeing as he has informed me that he feels he owes me a Favor. Considering that he has quite a bit of influence at court, this might be useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5327;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5329;[target_child.GetBestName], [From.GetBestName]'s [target_child.GetSonDaughter], is a rather courteous child. [target_child.GetSheHeCap] always treats me with respect, and [From.GetSheHe] might perhaps even make a good [target_child.GetSonDaughterCap] in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5329;I rather like [target_child.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5329;It matters not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5330;It seems [From.GetBestName] has taken a liking to [target_child.GetBestName], my [target_child.GetSonDaughter]. In fact, the feeling seems mutual, and I suspect that they might consider each other friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5330;That could be good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5332;[target_child.GetBestName], [From.GetBestName]'s [target_child.GetSonDaughter], is a very rude child. [target_child.GetSheHeCap] never treats me with respect, and [From.GetSheHe] would probably not make a good [target_child.GetSonDaughterCap].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5332;I hate that [target_child.GetBoyGirl]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5332;I can forgive [target_child.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5333;It seems [From.GetBestName] has grown to dislike [target_child.GetBestName], my [target_child.GetSonDaughter]. In fact, the feeling seems mutual, and I suspect that they might consider each other enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5333;That could be bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
### Grand Chancellor events
EVTDESC_SOH_5401;Today I was approached by a servant sent by [FromFrom.GetBestName], who asked me to pledge to support [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s bid to become the Grand Chancellor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5401;That sounds reasonable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5401;You will have to pay me first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5401;If [FromFrom.GetSheHe] will owe me a Favor, I'll do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_5401;If we consider it repayment of the Favor I owe, I'll do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_5401;How about we forget all about this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_5401;I'd rather resign from the council!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5402;The servant I sent to request support from [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that [From.GetSheHe] is prepared to support my bid to become the Grand Chancellor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5402;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5403;The servant I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that [From.GetSheHe] will only support my bid to become the Grand Chancellor if I pay [From.GetHerHim] a substantial amount of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5403;I suppose that's reasonable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5403;[From.GetSheHeCap] asks too much!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5404;I did not have to wait long for [From.GetBestName]'s servant to return, bringing with him the gold I asked for in return for my support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5404;Tell [From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetSheHe] will have my support!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5405;[From.GetBestName]'s servant returned before long with word that [From.GetBestName] is unwilling to pay me for my support and that it is too bad that we could not reach an agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5405;Did [From.GetSheHe] expect me to ask for less?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5406;My servant has returned with word that [From.GetBestName] is prepared to support my bid to become the Grand Chancellor if I am willing to consider it a Favor to be repaid when [From.GetSheHe] asks for something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5406;I suppose that's fair...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5406;I would rather not owe [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5407;[From.GetBestName]'s servant quickly returned with word that my request for a Favor in return for supporting [From.GetBestName]'s bid to become the Grand Chancellor was deemed acceptable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5407;This will surely be beneficial!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5408;It did not take long for [From.GetBestName]'s servant to return with word that [From.GetBestName] is unwilling to agree to owe me a Favor in exchange for me supporting [From.GetHerHim]'s bid to become the Grand Chancellor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5408;Well, I suppose that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5409;The servant I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that [From.GetSheHe] is willing to support my bid to become the Grand Chancellor if I am willing to consider it repayment of the Favor [From.GetSheHe] owes me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5409;That sounds reasonable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5409;I can think of better uses for that Favor...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5410;[From.GetBestName] did apparently not need to think for very long before reaching a decision as [From.GetHerHis] servant returned almost immediately with word that [From.GetBestName] is willing to consider my backing repayment of the Favor I owed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5410;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5411;It seems [From.GetBestName] might have other plans for the Favor I owe [From.GetHerHim] as [From.GetHerHis] servant returned with word that [From.GetSheHe] is unwilling to consider my support to be repayment of that Favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5411;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5412;The servant I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that [From.GetSheHe] deflected the request I made, and made some vague comments that makes it seem like it would be best for me to drop the matter for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5412;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5413;To my surprise, I have learned that [From.GetBestName] has resigned from the council. It seems [From.GetSheHe] did it to make a statement about [From.GetHerHis] unwillingness to support my bid to become the Grand Chancellor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5413;Maybe [From.GetHerHis] replacement will support me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5414;I have finally managed to ensure sufficient backing that [Root.Liege.GetBestName], the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, no longer can refuse to name me Grand Chancellor or to grant me and the rest of the council more authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5414;An auspicious day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5415;It has become clear that [From.GetBestName] has the support of a large number of my councillors, and it is impossible for me to avoid naming [From.GetHerHim] Grand Chancellor and to give [From.GetHerHim] and the rest of the council more authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5415;This is not ideal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5416;With my backing and the backing of several other councillors, [From.GetBestName]'s appointment as Grand Chancellor is now a fact, and [From.Liege.GetBestName], the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has given the council greater authority too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5416;I'm sure this bodes well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5417;[From.GetBestName] has managed to get enough support to be named Grand Chancellor, and [From.Liege.GetBestName], the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has also given the council greater authority. Though the latter might be good for me, the former could be a problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5417;I need to be careful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5418;It seems [From.GetBestName] has managed to convice [From.Liege.GetBestName], the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, to name [From.GetHerHim] Grand Chancellor and to give the council greater authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5418;Curious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5419;Having led the armies that put the new [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven on the throne to victory I am in position to become Grand Chancellor, and can also ensure greater authority for the council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5419;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5420;[From.GetBestName] was instrumental in ensuring that I gained the throne, and it is clear that the only reasonable reward for such a great service to me and the realm is to name [From.GetHerHim] Grand Chancellor and to give the council more authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5420;I suppose that's reasonable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5421;[From.GetBestName]'s efforts to put [From.Liege.GetBestName], the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, on the throne have earned [From.GetHerHim] the position of Grand Chancellor and has also ensured greater authority for the council as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5421;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5422;[From.GetBestName]'s efforts to put [From.Liege.GetBestName], the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, on the throne have earned [From.GetHerHim] the position of Grand Chancellor and has also ensured greater authority for the council as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5422;I suppose that could be a good thing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5423;[From.GetBestName]'s efforts to put [From.Liege.GetBestName], the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, on the throne have earned [From.GetHerHim] the position of Grand Chancellor and has also ensured greater authority for the council as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5423;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5424;[FromFrom.GetBestName] has sent a messenger with a request that I agree to give [FromFrom.GetHerHim] my spot on the council, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] would serve the realm better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5424;I suppose I can agree to that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5424;I'll need some money in return!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5424;If you'd agree to consider it a Favor, I'll do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_5424;Only if we consider it a Favor repaid...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_5424;I think I'll deflect the request...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_5424;I'd rather resign and hope someone else gets my old job!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5425;[From.GetBestName] has agreed to give me [From.GetHerHis] spot on the council, which surely will benefit both me and the realm as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5425;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5426;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] is willing to give me [From.GetHerHis] spot on the council if I pay [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5426;A reasonable request!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5426;I'd rather save the money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5427;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] has agreed to my request for money in exchange for my spot on the council, and the money has also been delivered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5427;The job is yours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5428;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] is unwilling to pay me in exchange for my spot on the council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5428;I guess I am keeping the job, then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5429;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] is willing to give me [From.GetHerHis] spot on the council if I am willing to grant a Favor in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5429;A reasonable request!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5429;I'd rather not owe [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5430;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] has agreed to my request for a future Favor in exchange for my spot on the council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5430;The job is yours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5431;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] is unwilling to owe me a Favor in exchange for my spot on the council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5431;I guess I am keeping the job, then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5432;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] is willing to give me [From.GetHerHis] spot on the council if I am willing to consider it a repayment of the Favor I am owed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5432;A reasonable request!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5432;I'd rather keep the Favor...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5433;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] has agreed to consider my spot on the council a suitable repayment of the Favor I owed [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5433;The job is yours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5434;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in considering my spot on the council a suitable repayment of the Favor I owe [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5434;I guess I am keeping the job, then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5435;[From.GetBestName] has managed to deflect the request I made for [From.GetHerHis] spot on the council, and it is unwise to press the issue at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5435;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5436;It seems [From.GetBestName] thinks that resigning from the council and letting our liege find a replacement is a better idea than giving [From.GetHerHis] spot to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5436;Perhaps I will still be picked?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5437;[FromFrom.GetBestName], the Grand Chancellor, has requested that I switch to [FromFrom.GetHerHis] voting pattern, indicating that I might find it in my best interests to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5437;I suppose I can agree to that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5437;I'll bribe [FromFrom.GetHerHim] instead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5437;I'll tell [FromFrom.GetHerHim] [FromFrom.GetSheHe] no longer owes me a Favor instead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_5437;I'll accept a loss of face instead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_5437;I'd rather resign!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5438;[From.GetBestName] agreed to my demand that [From.GetSheHe] should switch to my current voting pattern for the foreseeable future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5438;Just as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5439;Instead of switching to my current voting pattern [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to send me some money, doing it in such a fashion that I cannot refuse to accept it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5439;I can live with that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5440;[From.GetBestName] has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] will not switch to my current voting pattern, but that [From.GetSheHe] will instead cancel the Favor I owe [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5440;I suppose that's agreeable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5441;Instead of agreeing to switch to my current voting pattern [From.GetBestName] has chosen defiance, even though the request was worded in such a fashion that doing so means a loss of face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5441;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5442;It seems [From.GetBestName] would rather resign from the council than switch to my current voting pattern, as [From.GetSheHe] has informed our liege of [From.GetHerHis] immediate resignation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5442;That's unexpected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5444_A;A skilled strategist, [new_strategist.GetBestName], has heard of my great deeds and has offered me [new_strategist.GetHerHis] service, if I have a use of [new_strategist.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5444_B;[new_strategist.GetBestName], a skilled strategist familiar with my family history, has offered [new_strategist.GetHerHis] service, if I have a use of [new_strategist.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5444;[new_strategist.GetSheHeCap] will serve me well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5444;I don't need [new_strategist.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5445_A;A skilled siege engineer, [new_siege_engineer.GetBestName], has heard of my great deeds and has offered me [new_siege_engineer.GetHerHis] service, if I have a use of [new_strategist.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_5501;I now control China, and thus the Mandate of Heaven clearly belongs to me. As I did not claim the Mandate of Heaven prior to coming into possession of the Dragon Throne, I have yet to name my imperial dynasty, and this is not something I can postpone.\nBeing quite familiar with Chinese history, I do of course know quite a bit about previous Chinese dynasties, and perhaps picking a name belonging to a previous dynasty that achieved great things would be a wise course of action, but I could pick a different name if that feels more appropriate.\nWhat will the name of my dynasty be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_5502;[From.GetTitledFirstName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, now possesses the Dragon Throne, and has seen fit to claim the Mandate of Heaven, which hardly is surprising.\nHaving made the customary sacrifices to heaven and earth, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has decreed that [From.GetHerHis] imperial dynasty will be known as [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and [From.GetHerHis] supporters are already proclaiming that the new dynasty will last for ten thousand years and that both civilized foreigners and uncivilized barbarians should make sure to respect the will of the Dragon Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
