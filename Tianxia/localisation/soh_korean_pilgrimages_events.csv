EVTDESC_SOH_501;The time has come to leave on my pilgrimage. The journey will not be short, but based on what I have been told both Bulguksa and Seokguram are impressive enough that I will find the journey to have been worth it when I arrive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_502;At the Foot of the Mountain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_502;I have arrived at the foot of the mountain known as Dongak, the East Big Mountain. On its slopes, Bulguksa Temple and the Seokguram Grotto can be found, both of them holy places without compare in the Korean Peninsula.\nI am certainly not the only pilgrim here, and I am certainly not alone in feeling awed by the sight of the mountain and the temple above me. Within its walls, I can doubtlessly find monks and scholars and other notable people from both near and far, and I can probably find some in the grotto too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_502;Time to visit the holy places...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_504;One of the many sights to be seen at Bulguksa is Yeonhwagyo, the Lotus Flower Bridge, and the steps leading up to it. Many delicate lotus carvings can be found on those steps, faded due to the many pilgrims that have ascended the steps in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_504;Faded or not, they are quite beautiful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_505;As I walk up the stairway leading to Cheongungyo, the Blue Cloud Bridge, and Baegungyo, the White Cloud Bridge, I find myself considering my path to enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_505;Enlightenment shall be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_505;Enlightenment can wait...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_506;One of the many sights at Bulguksa is Dabotap, the Pagoda of Many Treasures. Inside it, I can see a number of valuable and beautiful relics of great importance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_506;Those relics sure are impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_507;Seokgatap, the Shadowless Pagoda, can be found at Bulguksa. Legend says that the wife of Asadal, the man who built the pagoda, drowned herself nearby after overhearing rumors indicating that her husband was going to marry a princess of Silla.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_507;Rumours always do more harm than good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_508;As I step up to Seokgatap, the Shadowless Pagoda, and take a closer look, I discover that one of the walls seems to be hollow. Investigating it, I find several valuable relics that apparently were unknown even to the monks at the temple, and they give one of them to me as a reward for my discovery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_508;I thank you for this gift!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_509;Two pagodas, Seokgatap and Dabotap, can be found near one another at Bulguksa. The former is rather plain, while the other is quite ornate. One of the other pilgrims asks me which one I prefer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_509;Seokgatap is quite beautiful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_509;Dabotap is clearly superior!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_510;There are many Buddha statues at Bulguksa and Seokguram, and they are all quite impressive. One of them is a gilt-bronze statue of the Amitabha Buddha, which is rather abstract but still beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_510;I am glad to have seen it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_511;Bulguksa was partially constructed to pacify the spirits of Gim Daeseong's parents, and as I am spending time at the temple I find myself considering my own deceased parents and what they might think of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_511;I must avoid disappointing them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_512;A massive Buddha sitting on a lotus pedestal can be found in Seokguram, surrounded by other statues. It seemingly has a halo around it, created by the decorations found nearby, and is one of the most impressive statues I have ever come across.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_512;But which Buddha is it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_513;Along with depictions of various Buddhas, bodhisattvas, disciples, and the Four Heavenly Kings found in Seokguram there are also two statues of Hindu gods, which is a bit unexpected as the grotto is a Buddhist place of worship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_513;I have always been intrigued by Hinduism...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_513;They are beautiful in their own way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_513;Their presence is unwelcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_514;The Four Heavenly Kings guard the Seokguram Grotto. I have always found them quite intriguing, and should perhaps try to emulate one of them. The question is, which one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_514;Damun-cheonwang, of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_514;Jeungjang-cheonwang, of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_514;Jiguk-cheonwang, of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_514;Gwangmok-cheonwang, of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

change_lifestyle_to_theologian;You will become a Theologian, forsaking any old lifestyle in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_515;During my visit to Bulguksa I find myself talking to several of the other pilgrims. One of them turns out to be a mystic of some renown, and tells me about the lifestyle he has chosen to follow in great detail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_515;Teach me how to be a Mystic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_515;Intriguing, but not for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_516;During my visit to Bulguksa I find myself talking to several of the other pilgrims. One of them turns out to be a scholar of some renown, and tells me about the lifestyle he has chosen to follow in great detail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_516;Teach me how to be a Scholar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_516;Intriguing, but not for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_517;During my visit to Bulguksa I find myself talking to several of the other pilgrims. One of them turns out to be a theologian of some renown, and tells me about the lifestyle he has chosen to follow in great detail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_517;Teach me how to be a Theologian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_517;Intriguing, but not for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_518;I had expected to meet men and women aspiring to reach Nirvana at Bulguksa, but instead I have met sinners and people of little faith, and I feel my own faith being tested more and more as time progresses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_518;Maybe this was a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_519;There are many monks to be found at Bulguksa, and they are a very welcoming lot, willing to answer any questions asked by pilgrims like me and eager to help everyone on the path to enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_519;They serve the Buddha well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_520;As I am about to leave Bulguksa after enjoying the sights one of the monks there approaches me to ask if I would be willing to make a charitable donation, maybe suspecting that I might be someone with more money than most that come to the temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_520;Of course I will donate to charity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_520;I have no money to spare...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
