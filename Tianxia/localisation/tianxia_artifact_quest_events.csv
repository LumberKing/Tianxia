EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1201;When travelling in [thuan_thien_province.GetName] I came across an old fisherman. He was quite pleased by our meeting, saying that it was a good omen. In return for the meeting, he offered me a meal at his home. A strange invitation, perhaps, but perhaps also an opportunity to learn more about my subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1201;Certainly! Take me to your home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1201;I'm afraid I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1202;As we reached the fisherman's home he immediately started preparing a drink for me. I asked him what it was, and he told me that it was a traditional brew in these parts, and that I had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to taste it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1202;That sounds lovely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1202;I'm not thirsty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TIANXIA_1202;Is the poison also traditional?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1203;The drink has an odd taste that I cannot quite place, but it is still fairly pleasant. I finish it fairly quickly, thanking my host. He suggests that maybe I should take a seat. The poison, he tells me, will take effect momentarily...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1203;Not... like...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1204;The drink has an odd taste that I cannot quite place, but it is still fairly pleasant... at first. It makes me queasy, and I hurriedly excuse myself, feeling the need to vomit. When I return, my host looks somewhat disappointed, and I do not find myself enjoying the meal in his company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1204;This evening could have gone better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1205;I politely refuse the drink, even though my host keeps trying to offer it to me. He finally lets out a sigh and goes to prepare the food, which is bland but filling. The evening is rather uneventful, and possibly a waste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1205;Well, that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1206;I signal my bodyguards as I make my accusation, and they enter before the fisherman can attempt any further harm. He does not even bother to protest his innocence, and his execution is swift. As I prepare to depart I notice that the man's neighbours do not appear to be pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1206;But I dealt with a criminal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1207;The fisherman's house is very small, and I order my guards and servants to stay outside once it has been determined that no ambush waits inside. I enter ahead of the fisherman and hear him bar the door behind him. Turning around, I see him pulling free a dagger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1207;How could I have missed this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1208;The treacherous fisherman turns out to be a very poor fighter, and I easily dodge his blows while drawing my sword. After that, the fight is quick and ends with his death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1208;Thus, always, to traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1209;The fisherman's first strike takes me by surprise, wounding me before I can back away. However, he is not skilled enough to finish the job, and once I have pulled free my sword the fight swiftly goes my way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1209;'Tis but a scratch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1210;The fisherman has the element of surprise, and he inflicts a grievous wound on me before I can back away. I do, however, manage to free my sword after that, and though he does not go down easily I eventually win the fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1210;That... was close...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1211;I scream for my guards and attempt to back away and draw my sword, but the fisherman is far too quick, and I suffer a fatal wound in short order. I get the sword free from my scabbard and can hear the guards trying to get inside, but my strength is fading along with my vision...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1211;Not... like...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1212;The fisherman wastes no time when it comes to the food preparations once we have arrived at his house. He cooks up a stew of some kind, and serves me and my guards generous portions. It is clearly not a fish stew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1212;Guards, arrest that man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1212;Actually, I am not hungry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TIANXIA_1212;I am open to trying new things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_TIANXIA_1212;Finally a proper meal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_TIANXIA_1212;Time to eat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1213;The fisherman's protests are for naught as my servants quickly uncover the butchered corpses of several humans behind his house. As preparations are being made to bring him before the nearest magistrate, I learn that some of the bodies have been identified as locals that have gone missing recently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1213;I think the trial will be swift...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1214;I watch with some distaste as my guards and servants gorge themselves on the human stew the fisherman has prepared, wondering if I should have said something. They look like they are enjoying the meal, but they probably do not know what they are eating...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1214;Did I do the right thing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1215;Having made my decision, I start eating my stew. I feel somewhat nauseous at first, but that passes after a while, even though I know this is wrong. Still, I keep eating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1215;Refusing would have been rude...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1216;Several of my guards have joined me at the red table in the past, and we do so enjoy the opportunity to feast on human flesh. The other guards and the servants seem to be finding the meal to their liking as well, even if I cannot tell if they have realized what they are eating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1216;Is there enough for a second serving?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1217;The meal is filling, though the meat is quite odd, and I cannot place it. The fisherman's answers as to what we are eating are elusive, and some of my servants decide to investigate. Inside the kitchen, they find the butchered corpse of a woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1217;Let us never speak of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1217;Guards! Arrest him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1218;After I have finished a light meal with the fisherman he suggests a quick game of weiqi before I take my leave. Apparently he considers himself a fairly good player, and even suggests a small wager.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1218;Certainly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1218;I need to leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1219;The fisherman is a better player than I originally thought that he would be, but I am not a novice player, and though the game takes a while to complete I end up winning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1219;Good game!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1219;I should do this more often!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1220;The fisherman turns out to be a formidable opponent, and though I am no novice player it does not take long before I realize that the game already is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1220;Good game!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1221;I cannot say that I have a bad evening in the company of the fisherman, or that the meal he offers is poor. The evening is rather uneventful, however...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1221;I suppose that's fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1222;As I enter the fisherman's house I take a good look around as I am not used to such surroundings. I notice that he has the blade of a sword on display on one of the walls, which is strangely intriguing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1222;Maybe he will give it to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1222;I'll take that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TIANXIA_1222;I will steal it later!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_TIANXIA_1222;Surely it is for sale!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1223;One thing I immediately note inside the fisherman's home is the darkness, as well as the light shining from the hilt-less blade of a sword that's standing in one corner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1223;Maybe he will give it to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1223;I'll take that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TIANXIA_1223;I will steal it later!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_TIANXIA_1223;Surely it is for sale!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1224;The fisherman turns out to be willing to part with the blade that I have taken an interest in, stating that he was considering throwing that thing away since it has not been useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1224;I will find a use for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1225;The fisherman tells me that he wishes to keep the blade, and as I am a guest in his house I cannot press the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1225;Well, that's unfortunate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1226;I move to seize the blade, to the disappointment of the fisherman. He tries to take it back from me, but I overwhelm him easily enough, and take my leave as he lies bleeding out on the floor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1226;It's mine now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1227;The fisherman sees me going for the blade and grabs on to it at the same time as I do. We both try to pull it away from the other, which turns out to be a mistake as it is rather brittle and comes apart. Wounded by the metal fragments, I depart from the house.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1227;That did not work out...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1228;The fisherman tells me to drop the blade when I seize it. When I refuse to do so, he grabs his dagger and lunges at me, the swiftness of his action taking me by surprise. I take a fatal wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1228;No...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1229;The fisherman sleeps deeply, and I have no trouble whatsoever seizing the blade and departing. He mentioned that some of his neighbours covet it, so I doubt he will suspect me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1229;It's mine now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1230;I sneak into the fisherman's house in the middle of the night and move towards where the blade was located. It is not there. As I start looking around for it, I hear movement behind me. Before I can turn around, a dagger is dragged across my throat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1230;This cannot...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1231;The fisherman is willing to part with the blade for the right price, which turns out to be my starting offer as I set it fairly high. I pay the agreed-upon sum and then spend a nice evening in his company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1231;Money solves everything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1233;I have started to hear rumors about a strangely glowing tree in [thuan_thien_province.GetName]. It might perhaps be worth heading there to see what all the fuss is about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1233;I will head there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1233;This is beneath me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1234;The glowing tree turns out to only be glowing because of the sunlight filtering through its branches. However, there appears to be something odd in them. I cannot quite make it out from down here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1234;I will climb it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1234;That peasant child can climb it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TIANXIA_1234;Guards! Cut it down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_TIANXIA_1234;It's probably nothing useful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1235;The tree is not glowing, that much is certain. The glow is instead coming from something in its branches. I cannot make out what it is from the ground, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1235;I will climb it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1235;That peasant child can climb it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TIANXIA_1235;Guards! Cut it down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_TIANXIA_1235;It's probably nothing useful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1236;It turns out there is no strangely glowing tree to be found anywhere in [thuan_thien_province.GetName], at least not any longer. It seems it was cut down recently, and that the supposed glow only was due to the sunlight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1236;Well, that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1237;I climb the tree with some difficulty, reaching the object I spotted from the ground after a while. It turns out to be a gem-encrusted sword hilt, without a matching blade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1237;A hilt? Strange...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1238;I start climbing the tree, making good progress. However, my grip slips after a while, and I fall down, hitting some branches on the way. The landing is painful, if not cripplingly so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1238;I should give up...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1239;I climb the tree easily enough at first, but as I start nearing the object I spotted my foot slips and I find myself tumbling to the ground, hitting several branches on the way. The injury I suffer is substantial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1239;I cannot try again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1240;I climb the tree as quickly as I can, making very good progress. Then, suddenly, I lose my balance, followed by my grip. I fall from a great height, and the ground does not look soft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1240;This is the end...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1241;The peasant child climbs the tree easily enough, reaching the mysterious object and bringing it down for me to see. It turns out to be a gem-encrusted sword hilt, without a matching blade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1241;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1242;The peasant child is eager enough to climb the tree, but his climbing ability is not up to the task, and he falls to the ground from a great height. I do not know if he survives, and the angry look of the locals makes me eager to leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1242;It's not my fault he fell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1243;My guards cut down the tree easily enough, and I recover the mysterious object, which turns out to be a gem-encrusted sword hilt without a matching blade. The locals are not happy about me cutting down their tree and taking the hilt, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1243;You can't please everyone...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1244;My guards have no trouble cutting down the tree, but the mysterious object turns out to be some useless glass bauble, likely brought there by a bird. The locals are not happy about me cutting their tree down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1244;It was just a regular tree!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1246;Thuan Thien;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1246;The shining blade without a hilt and the gem-encrusted hilt fit together as if they have always meant to be one whole, and the work of the swordsmith to forge the sword is fairly quick.\nAs I grasp it, I feel with a certainty that this sword should be named Thuan Thien -- Heaven's Will -- as my possession of it clearly is because Heaven has willed it. I believe it will serve me well, come what may.\nMay it help strengthen my rule and help me overcome my foes, for such is the will of Heaven!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1246;Bow before Heaven's Will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1248;The Fate of the Sword;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1248;One day when I am walking along the shores of a lake I think about Thuan Thien, hanging in its scabbard along my side.\nThe sword has served me well, that is certain, but though it certainly might be useful perhaps the time has come for me to put it aside permanently.\nThe temptation to keep using it would be great, and simply handing it off to someone does not seem like Heaven's will, so a more permanent solution would be required. Throwing it into the lake would certainly suffice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1248;I should throw it away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1248;The sword is and will remain mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_TIANXIA_1249;The Fate of the Sword;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1249;One day when I am being rowed across a lake an enormous golden-shelled turtle comes swimming towards my boat. It shines with a light not unlike that of Thuan Thien, so I am certain its origin is divine.\n"Honourable [Root.GetTitledName], I bring word from my master, Long Vuong," the turtle says once it has come close, speaking in a human voice. "It is time for you to return Thuan Thien to him, lest the sword's power corrupts you."\nRefusal would clearly not be the will of Heaven...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1249;As you decree, mighty Kim Qui!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1249;I will never give it up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1250;A number of farmers residing in [seal_province.GetName] have requested and audience with me. Upon granting their request, they tell me that they have discovered an unusual stone slab in the middle of a field, and that they require instructions as to what to do with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1250;I need to see it myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1250;Do as you see fit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1251;The stone slab is massive, and covered in well-worn ancient carvings, some of them almost looking like writing. Its purpose eludes me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1251;I will move it aside!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1251;Push it aside for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TIANXIA_1251;I will break it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_TIANXIA_1251;Guards! Break it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_TIANXIA_1251;I think it should be left alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1252;It takes some work, but with the proper leverage and the application of sufficient force I am able to push the stone slab aside. Several of the peasants seem quite impressed with my strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1252;Let's see what lies beneath!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1253;I push on the stone slab with all my strength, but it does not budge. I try again and again, but it makes no difference. My final attempt sends me flying backwards, landing in the muddy field a very undignified fashion. The peasants have a good laugh at that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1253;Guards! Punish those that laughed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1253;This was embarrassing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1254;The peasants are sceptical at first, but with some positive encouragement and the proper application of leverage they are able to push the stone slab aside without too much difficultly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1254;Let's see what lies beneath!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1255;The peasants are not happy with being put to work, and my attempt to properly motivate them only seems to make them less eager to work. Worse, the stone slab refuses to move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1255;They seem angry with me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1256;Having studied the carvings on the slab carefully, I have determined several weak spots. With the help of a pickaxe provided by one of the peasants, I am able to demolish the stone slab without too much difficulty. The peasants do not seem happy, but the way is clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1256;Let's see what lies beneath!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1257;Using a pickaxe I managed to talk one of the peasants into lending me, I attempt to demolish the stone slab, striking at what I think are some weak spots. My efforts turn out to be futile, though I do manage to ruin the carvings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1257;The peasants do not seem happy about that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1258;I give the order for my guards to attempt to demolish the stone slab over the protests of the peasants, and they get to work without delay. Before long, the stone slab has been turned into a pile of rubble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1258;Let's see what lies beneath!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1259;I order my guards to attempt to demolish the stone slab, and they make a good effort despite the peasants loudly protesting against the action. Unfortunately, my guards turn out to be unable to destroy the stone slab.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1259;And the peasants seem quite upset...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1261;Nothing. There is nothing to be found beneath the stone slab. Perhaps its purpose was simply decorative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1261;That was disappointing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1262;I find a pile of ancient gold coins beneath the stone slab, which I suppose I can find a use for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1262;Well, that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1263;Underneath the stone slab there is a set of stairs leading into a small chamber filled with carvings that are far more readable than those on the slab itself. I manage to make out several useful insights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1263;What a curious place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1264;A set of stairs lies behind the stone slab, leading into a small chamber. Inside, atop a carved pedestal, lies an ornate golden seal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1264;It is magnificient!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1265;During the expansion of a Buddhist monastery in Ganzhou, the locals discovered an ancient tomb. There seems to be some disagreement as to whether it should be explored or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1265;We should explore it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1265;Leave it alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1267;The tomb turns out to be empty. Whether it simply has been plundered in the past or it never was put into use is unknown, but there is nothing here for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1267;That was underwhelming...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1268;The walls of the tomb are full of carvings containing the wisdom of the past. Some of it might even be applicable for me today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1268;Not bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1269;There is some gold to be found in the tomb, and I can always find use for more gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1269;A nice find!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1270;Among many lesser items in the tomb there is a bronze statue of a horse mid-leap, looking as if it is flying. It certainly is an unexpected find.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1270;I should figure out where to put it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1271;Today a peasant in my realm requested an audience. Curious as to the reason, I granted the request. The man handed over a manuscript written in an archaic dialect, suggesting that I maybe should get it translated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1271;I suppose I should!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1271;I... think not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1273;The translators I have put to work translating the archaic text the peasant gave me claim that the funds I have allocated to their use are starting to run out. If I want them to continue, I will need to provide additional funds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1273;Money is no object!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1273;I can provide adequate funds...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TIANXIA_1273;This has already been too expensive...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1274;The translators working for me have regretfully informed me that a number of their notes have been lost. Apparently there was a fierce gust of wind at the wrong time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1274;Not ideal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1275;Today I came across a book in my library that covers ancient phrases and the writing systems used in times long gone. My translators could perhaps make good use of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1275;It will certainly not hurt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1276;My translator have informed me that their efforts have been for naught. The manuscript provided by the peasant is untranslateable, and they have far more questions than answers at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1276;This was a wasted effort...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1277;The manuscript turns out to be a book written by some peasant. It tells a fanciful tale... of the time the rice harvest was unusually abundant, and everyone celebrated for a week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1277;Not an enthralling tale...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1278;The peasant's unknown manuscript has finally been translated. It contains a number of unusual insights that perhaps can be put to good use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1278;Better than nothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1279;The peasant's unknown manuscript has finally been translated. It contains a number of unusual insights that perhaps can be put to good use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1279;Better than nothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1280;The peasant's unknown manuscript has finally been translated. It contains a number of unusual insights that perhaps can be put to good use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1280;Better than nothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1281;The manuscript turns out to be a very old copy of the [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]. Despite its age, the contents seem unchanged, which is proof that the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith has been around since times immemorial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1281;Inspiring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1282;The translators eagerly report that they have finished translating the manuscript. The result, tentatively titled the "Epic of Darkness", is a record of ancient myths and legends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1282;That sounds quite interesting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1283;I possess a copy of the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms. Unfortunately, like most copies, it is incomplete. Maybe I should task some scholars with compiling a more complete version, using assorted sources?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1283;A worthy task!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1283;I don't think I will...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1285;One of my agents has learned of a bureaucrat that might possess some records that would be useful in my efforts to compile a complete version of the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms. They need instructions as to how to proceed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1285;Negotiate with the bureaucrat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1285;Steal the records!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TIANXIA_1285;Just pay him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1286;The bureaucrat turns out to be quite easy to persuade, and my agents acquire the records in his possession. Hopefully, the scholars will be able to make good use of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1286;Good job!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1287;The bureaucrat is not convinced by the letter I tell my agents to convey to him, and I am informed that he has no interest in sharing his records with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1287;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1288;The bureaucrat's security arrangements are not particularly formidable, and my agents acquire the records in his possession. Hopefully, the scholars will be able to make good use of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1288;Good job!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1289;The bureaucrat's security arrangements are formidable, and several of my agents die trying to penetrate them. Eventually, they are forced to withdraw, their mission unsuccessful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1289;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1290;The bureaucrat, like most people, cares quite a bit for gold, and my agents acquire the records in his possession. Hopefully, the scholars will be able to make good use of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1290;Good job!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1291;The bureaucrat does not seem to be interested in money, and even seems to have taken the offer as an insult. My agents will not be able to procure his records.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1291;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1292;I have been informed that many notes gathered by the scholars seeking to compile a complete copy of the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms have been lost in an unfortunate fireplace-related incident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1292;Unfortunate indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1293;Today the scholars working on compiling a more complete copy of the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms informed me that they have discovered many mistakes in their notes and the records they have access to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1293;That's not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1294;I have been informed that additional funs will be required if I wish for the scholars to keep working on the more complete version of the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1294;Money is no object!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1294;I can spare some funds...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_TIANXIA_1294;I won't throw good money after bad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1295;Recently, I have been feeling that I perhaps could contribute to the work the scholars are doing on the recompiling of the complete version of the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1295;I will assist them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1295;I don't want to disturb their work..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1296;It seems my assistance was quite useful, as a fresh set of eyes was just what the scholars needed. I think they are quite a bit closer to succeeding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1296;I knew I could help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1297;It seems I caused more issues than I solved while trying to help the scholars with their work. They have kindly asked me to not try again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1297;That's not as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1298;The scholars have informed me that they have been unsuccessful. The notes they have compiled are a mess, and they will not be able to recreate a more complete version of the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1298;This displeases me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1299;I have finally been presented with the work of the scholars. They have indeed managed to create a more complete version of the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1299;Time to read it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1300;A young Brahmin requested an audience today. He claims that he knows the location of a grand temple complex somewhere in the jungle, which might hold a relic of great value.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1300;Take me there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1300;I don't believe you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1302;The young Brahmin was quite confident that he knew the way when we headed into the jungle, but as time passed he became less and less confident. Eventually, it was clear that we were lost, and that we could not even find our way back to civilization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1302;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1303;One day as I prepare to drink from a stream in the jungle I hear movement behind me. I turn to see the young Brahmin standing there, a dagger at the ready.\n"I think it is time for this charade to end," he says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1303;Treachery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1304;The young Brahmin misses as he lunges at me, and the move puts him off balance. I pull free my sword and cut him down before he has time to make another attempt to end my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1304;I should return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1305;I am caught off guard, and the Brahmin manages to wound me before I can pull free my sword. Once I have it in my hand, however, he proves no match for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1305;I should return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1306;I am badly wounded by the Brahmin's first strike, and I have a hard time fighting back even after I pull free my sword. However, eventually I gain the upper hand, and he dies at my hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1306;I hope I can make it back home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1307;I take a bad wound from the Brahmin's first strike, and he manages to land more blows as I try to pull free my sword. I get it out of its scabbard, but it slips from me, much like my strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1307;No! This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1308;We have arrived at the temple the Brahmin told me about, or so he tells me, at least. There's some ruins that may or may not have been a temple once, but certainly no relics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1308;This is not what you promised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1308;Time to head home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1309;We have arrived at the temple the Brahmin told me about, or so he tells me, at least. It is just a small shrine, clearly not significant enough to contain a relic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1309;This is it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1309;Time to head home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1310;We have arrived at a somewhat overgrown but still grand temple in the middle of the jungle. The Brahmin who guided me here insists there must be a hidden passage somewhere, but we cannot find anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1310;What a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1310;It was worth a visit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1311;We have arrived at a somewhat overgrown but still grand temple in the middle of the jungle. Exploring it, we quickly find a hidden passage leading down beneath the temple, which the Brahmin tells me must lead to the relic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1311;We must investigate this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1311;I think we should leave it be...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1313;As we head down a set of stairs beneath the temple I feel one of the steps move almost imperceptively beneath my foot. Before I can react, a large boulder falls down from the ceiling, crushing my companion and landing on top of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1313;Can't... breathe...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1314;The passageway turns out to be a dead end. I turn around to head back, only to see the Brahmin pulling out a dagger and lunge at me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1314;It's a trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1315;The young Brahmin misses as he lunges at me, and the move puts him off balance. I pull free my sword and cut him down before he has time to make another attempt to end my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1315;I should return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1316;I am badly wounded by the Brahmin's first strike, and I have a hard time fighting back even after I pull free my sword. However, eventually I gain the upper hand, and he dies at my hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1316;I should return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1317;I am badly wounded by the Brahmin's first strike, and I have a hard time fighting back even after I pull free my sword. However, eventually I gain the upper hand, and he dies at my hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1317;I hope I can make it back home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1318;I take a bad wound from the Brahmin's first strike, and he manages to land more blows as I try to pull free my sword. I get it out of its scabbard, but it slips from me, much like my strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1318;No! This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1319;The hidden passage opens up into a great chamber. It contains nothing but dust, and the walls are completely unadorned. Perhaps the builders of the temple never got around to finishing this part of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1319;Strange...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1320;The hidden passage opens up into a great chamber with ornately carved walls. There is a pedestal at the centre of it, but nothing to be found atop it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1320;Someone must have gotten here first...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1321;The hidden passage opens up into a great chamber with ornately carved walls. There is a pedestal at the centre of it, atop which a bow rests. It looks quite majestic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1321;This will serve me well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
