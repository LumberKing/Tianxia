EVTDESC_SOH_7201;In exchange for [liao_emperor.GetHerHis] support in the recent war [liao_emperor.GetSheHe] was promised overlordship of the Sixteen Prefectures. While it doubtlessly would be an unpopular to honor this promise, reneging on it would show that I am untrustworthy, and it would doubtlessly also upset [liao_emperor.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7201;I will honor our deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7201;I have altered the deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_7201;I will honor the deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_7201;That was a personal promise made by another!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7202;As previously agreed [From.GetBestName] has transferred control of the Sixteen Prefectures to me. The messenger who brought me the news further informs me that [From.GetBestName] would like formal acknowledgement of our friendship in the form of a non-aggression pact, as that was discussed at the time when the original agreement was made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7202;Friendship would be beneficial;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7202;I don't recall such an agreement...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7203;[From.GetBestName] has seen fit to transfer my holdings in the Sixteen Prefectures to [liao_emperor.GetBestName]. I am in no position to oppose this move, even though it is clear that it is a betrayal of everything that the Dragon Throne should stand for. Who knows what [From.GetBestName] will cede to a barbarian in the future?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7203;[From.GetSheHeCap] is unfit to rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7204;The messenger I sent to inform [From.GetBestName] of the transfer of the Sixteen Prefectures has returned with worrisome news. Though the transfer was accepted it would seem [From.GetBestName] is not interested in continued friendship between the two of us as [From.GetSheHe] refused to agree to a formal non-aggression pact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7204;I need to prepare my defenses...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7205;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName]. At first I think that the messenger is bringing news that the Sixteen Prefectures will be turned over as previously agreed, but instead the messenger informs you that [From.GetBestName] does not intend to cede any Chinese land to barbarians and that I should withdraw from China immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7205;I pray [From.GetSheHe] alters it no further...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7205;I will force [From.GetHerHim] to honor the deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_7205;I can also alter the deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7206;[From.GetBestName] is invading [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s lands, supposedly in response to [From.GetBestName] reneging on a deal to hand over the Sixteen Prefectures. There are those that would say that it would have been wrong to honor a deal to hand over Chinese land, others would say that anyone who would claim the Dragon Throne should honor their word.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7206;This is not my concern...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7206;All of China must fight this threat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7207;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], promising reinforcements to assist me against [FromFrom.GetBestName]. It would seem that I am not going to have to face the Khitan menace on my own, as there are those that agree that I was in the right when I decided not to turn over the Sixteen Prefectures as previously agreed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7207;We stand together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7208;Though the recent war ended in defeat it is possible that I still can secure the Sixteen Prefectures, seeing as [tang_emperor.GetBestName] probably would want to secure [tang_emperor.GetHerHis] northern border. A non-aggression pact might not be too steep a price to pay, and showing that I am willing to consider diplomacy might also be helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7208;I will send a messenger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7208;This is a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7209;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName] with a somewhat tempting offer that would secure the northern border, at least in the near future. All I would have to give in return is a non-aggression pledge of your own, and the Sixteen Prefectures. The latter part might not be to everyone's liking, though maybe it is still worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7209;I will cede the Sixteen Prefectures!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7209;I will not cede Chinese land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7210;The messenger I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that my proposal was agreeable, and the Sixteen Prefectures have been transferred to me. Though the way into China will be blocked while the non-aggression pact lasts I can now safely expand elsewhere without having to prepare for an attack from my Chinese neighbours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7210;This was a mutually beneficial agreement!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7211;[From.GetBestName] has seen fit to transfer my holdings in the Sixteen Prefectures to [liao_emperor.GetBestName]. I am in no position to oppose this move, even though it is clear that it is a betrayal of everything that the Dragon Throne should stand for. Who knows what [From.GetBestName] will cede to a barbarian in the future?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7211;[From.GetSheHeCap] is unfit to rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7212;The messenger I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that my proposal was not agreeable and that [From.GetBestName] is not open to ceding the Sixteen Prefectures regardless of what I might offer in return for them. While not what I wanted to hear, the fact that I lost the recent war might have been a factor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7212;I am not surprised...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7212;The Sixteen Prefectures should be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7213;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to claim the Sixteen Prefectures, seemingly not content with being told that they are rightfully part of my realm. While [From.GetSheHe] has not made any move to attempt to actually secure them, it is very possible that that might happen in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7213;I invite [From.GetHerHim] to try!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7215;Before the war against Liao started we entered into an agreement with the Jurchen where we would gain the Sixteen Prefectures at the end of the war. Now the war has ended, and the Sixteen Prefectures have not been handed over. Perhaps it is time to issue a formal demand... or perhaps we should just strive for peace?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7215;I will demand the Sixteen Prefectures!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7215;I will request a non-aggression pact!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_7215;I will not bother sending an envoy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7216;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], requesting that we honor our agreement to hand over the Sixteen Prefectures. If we do so, we will get a non-aggression pact with the Dragon Throne. Of course, perhaps it is time to alter the deal...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7216;Of course they will be handed over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7216;How about we only sign a non-aggression pact?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_7216;Get this envoy out of my sight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7217;The envoy I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that the Sixteen Prefectures will be handed over in accordance with our previous agreement, in exchange for a non-aggression pact that surely will benefit us all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7217;Peace in our time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7218;My envoy has returned with word that [From.GetBestName] does not wish to hand over the Sixteen Prefectures but that [From.GetSheHe] is willing to agree to a non-aggression pact. This is not what we had agreed to previously, but perhaps I should not press the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7218;Time to make it an ultimatum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7218;Well, I suppose we can agree to this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7219;I have received word that [From.GetBestName] has agreed to the non-aggression pact I propsed despite it not including the transfer of the Sixteen Prefectures. It seems [From.GetSheHe] does not care to start a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7219;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7220;I have received another demand for the Sixteen Prefectures, this time phrased as an ultimatum. According to the envoy, [From.GetBestName] is prepared to declare war if I do not honor the original agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7220;I don't want a war...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7220;They're bluffing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_7220;Then war it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7221;I have received word that [From.GetBestName] has agreed to hand over the Sixteen Prefectures. It seems the ultimatum that was delivered convinced [From.GetHerHim] that it was in [From.GetHerHis] interests to honor the original agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7221;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7222;The envoy I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned, informing me that [From.GetBestName] laughed at the idea that I would be prepared to declare war on [From.GetHerHim] over the Sixteen Prefectures. It is clear there will be no non-aggression treaty, and it is up to me to decide if there will be a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7222;We can't afford a war...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7222;Prepare for war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7223;An envoy has arrived from [From.GetBestName], requesting that we enter into a non-aggression pact. The envoy has not mentioned the fact that we originally had promised to hand over the Sixteen Prefectures, so it is clear that [From.GetBestName] does not want to press that issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7223;A reasonable proposal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7223;We will agree to no such thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7224;My envoy has returned from [From.GetBestName], bringing word that [From.GetSheHe] is willing to sign a non-aggression pact. It seems the decision to not discuss the matter of the Sixteen Prefectures was a good one, at least in the short term.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7224;Peace in our time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7225;I have received word that [From.GetBestName] is unwilling to enter into a non-aggression pact with me. [From.GetSheHeCap] is clearly not to be trusted, and still holds the Sixteen Prefectures, so maybe it is best to declare war to force [From.GetHerHim] to hand them over?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7225;We can't afford a war...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7225;Prepare for war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7226;I had expected to receive an envoy from [From.GetBestName] regarding the Sixteen Prefectures, or at least a non-aggression treaty, but no such envoy has arrived. I doubt this is a good sign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7226;I need to look to my defenses...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7227;[From.GetBestName] has sent an emissary informing me that the time has come for my empire to be formally integrated into [From.GetHerHis], seeing as [From.GetSheHe] possesses the Mandate of Heaven and I do not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7227;I suppose I can't refuse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7227;The Middle Kingdom will be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7228;The emissary I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that [From.GetSheHe] sensibly has chosen to accept the integration of [From.GetHerHis] realm into mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7228;Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7229;The emissary I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that [From.GetSheHe] has refused the integration of [From.GetHerHis] realm into mine and that [From.GetSheHe] claims to be the rightful ruler of all China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7229;It's treason, then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7230;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName] has submitted to the Dragon Throne, possibly due to lingering loyalties or doubts regarding my true intentions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7230;Traitor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7231;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] has submitted to my authority, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] only claimed the Dragon Throne under duress and that [From.GetSheHe] always has been loyal to me and my family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7231;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
