EVTDESC_SOH_3901;I have decided to hold a hanami and to invite my vassals to the celebration, but first it will be necessary for me to make sure that the necessary preparations have been seen to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3901;Let's get started!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3902;While my guests will be staying at my court for some time during the hanami I still need to decide whether the main event will take place during the day or the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3902;I think I'll have it during the day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3902;The night would be more appealing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3903;During the preparations for the hanami I have considered various forms of entertainment for my guests. One option would be to hire some shirabyoshi to entertain my guests. Perhaps I should hire a few.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3903;That would be a good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3903;I should save the money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3904;My capital could perhaps use some embellishments during the hanami. The commoners would appreciate it, for one thing, and chances are the guests would like it too, even though they will most likely only experience it from afar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3904;Some modest decoarations would be worthwhile!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3904;Spare no expense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3904;Who cares about the commoners?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3905;Some of the nearby Shinto shrines would doubtlessly appreciate it if I sent some offerings for the kami at the time of the hanami, and I could most likely spare the coin for that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3905;I will send a small offering!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3905;I will send a grand offering!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3905;I think a tainted offering would be best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3905;I see little reason for this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3906;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName] is sending some offerings to a Shinto shrine in preparation for an upcoming hanami. I believe I have the opportunity to taint these offerings, should I wish to use it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3906;They will be tainted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3906;It is too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3907;My personal garden has seen better days, and with the guests having to spend time there to enjoy the cherry blossoms properly it might be a good idea to improve it ahead of the hanami so that they do not find anything to complain about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3907;I will do it myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3907;I will hire a gardener!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3907;I know how to do that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3907;It isn't worth it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3908;I will need to have food prepared for the hanami. The question is, how much am I willing to spend on it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3909;With the preparations nearing completion it is time for me to invite my vassals to join me for the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3910;[Root.GetTitledName]\n, I hereby invite you to my upcoming hanami. I hope that you will find the time to attend.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3910;I will attend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3910;I won't attend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3911;[Root.GetTitledName]\n, I have no interest in joining you for your hanami at this time, and have to decline your invitation.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3912;Under the Cherry Blossoms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_3912;The cherry blossoms are in full bloom in [Root.Capital.GetName], and it looks like it will be a beautiful day. As my vassals arrive from both near and far I look out across my garden with a smile on my face.\n\nHopefully, this will be a memorable occasion that is found satisfactory for everyone. If not, it is too late to do anything about it now. I wave over a nearby servant and give them a few quick instructions regarding the final preparations before heading down to greet one of the new arrivals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_3912;The cherry blossoms are in full bloom in [Root.Capital.GetName], and hundreds of paper lanterns hang amongst them to illuminate the night. As mu vassals arrive from both near and far I look out across my garden with a smile on my face.\n\nHopefully, this will be a memorable occasion that everyone finds satisfactory, but there are a thousand things that could go wrong. Of course, it is a bit late to worry about that now, and I do my best to put it out of my mind as I head down to greet one of the recent arrivals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3912;Welcome! Welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3913;Under the Cherry Blossoms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_3913;The cherry blossoms are in full bloom in [From.Capital.GetName] as my party arrives, and it looks like it will be a beautiful day. My liege, [From.GetTitledName], has invited vassals from both near and far, and I see both familiar faces and faces I barely recognize.\n\nThe hanami should be a memorable occasion, and I hope that I will have a good time, along with everyone else. Doubtlessly, [From.GetTitledName] has prepared for every eventuality, as [From.GetSheHe] has a smile on [From.GetHerHis] face as [From.GetSheHe] greets me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_3913;The cherry blossoms are in full bloom in [From.Capital.GetName] as my party arrives, and hundreds of paper lanterns hang amongst them to illuminate the night. My liege, [From.GetTitledName], has invited vassals from both near and far, and I see both familiar faces and faces I barely recognize.\n\nThe hanami should be a memorable occasion, and I hope that everyone will have a good time. Given that [From.GetTitledName] seems unconcerned as [From.GetSheHe] greets me, there should be nothing to worry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3913;Thank you for inviting me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3915;[From.GetTitledName] has seen fit to extensively decorate [From.GetHerHis] capital for the hanami, and it truly is a sight to behold. Even if I ignore the cherry trees themselves, it is a most impressive display.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3915;Indeed it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3916;My servants inform me that they have overheard [From.GetTitledName] speak with approval of the decorations I saw fit to arrange for the people of my capital. Clearly, not only the commoners appreciate the display.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3916;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3917;Aside from the cherry trees in [From.GetTitledName]'s garden and elsewhere [From.Capital.GetName] is almost entirely without decorations. It seems [From.GetTitledName] cannot be bothered to show off [From.GetHerHis] wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3917;This is far too plain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3918;It would seem [From.GetTitledName] has expressed [From.GetHerHis] dislike of the lack of decorations in [Root.Capital.GetName] where people could overhear [From.GetHerHim]. Perhaps I should have invested more in decorations...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3918;Maybe next time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3919;My liege, [From.GetTitledName], has seen fit to send some offerings to a nearby Shinto shrine as part of the hanami celebration, doubtlessly hoping that the kami will be pleased by this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3919;A good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3919;I should say that I approve...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3920;Shortly after thanks arrived from the shrine I sent offerings to [From.GetTitledName] took the time to add [From.GetHerHis] own thanks to those of the priests at the shrine. It would seem that [From.GetSheHe] was impressed by my generosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3920;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3921;It would seem that [From.GetTitledName] has not seen fit to send a proper offering to the kami at a nearby shrine. The priests did not see fit to complain, but I could still do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3921;I am offended!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3921;I will pretend to be outraged...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3922;[From.GetTitledName] requested a word in private with me, and once we were away from the other guests [From.GetSheHe] angrily complained about the lack of a proper offering for the kami of a nearby shrine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3922;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3924;My attempt to taint the offerings sent to a shrine as part of the hanami has been successful. The priests sent a messenger thanking me profusedly for the offerings, which now pollute the shrine with unholy energies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3924;Perhaps I should send more "gifts"...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3925;A priest arrived today from the shrine I sent offerings to, informing me that the offerings seemed unclean and that the priests had decided not to present them to the kami. However, I do not seem to be under suspicion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3925;It could have gone worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3926;It would seem the priests at the shrine I sent some tainted offerings to are a suspicious lot. The sabotage was discovered, and now fingers are being pointed my way. Nothing can be proven, but...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3926;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3928;My tainting of the offerings [FromFrom.GetTitledName] sent to the kami at a nearby shrine went well. The priests have sent word that they are thankful for the offerings, and clearly they are not suspecting that their shine has been befouled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3928;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3929;My attempt to taint the offerings [FromFrom.GetTitledName] sent to the kami at a nearby shrine did not pan out. The priests discovered that something was awry with the offerings right away, even if my involvement does not seem to be suspected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3929;Not as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3930;Word has reached me from the shrine I sent some offerings to that someone has attempted to pollute them. The priests are convinced that I am not to blame, but they cannot determine whose fault it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3930;Who did this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3931;I attempted to taint the offerings [FromFrom.GetTitledName] sent to the kami at a nearby shrine, but this has turned out poorly. There is no proof, but I have heard whispers suggesting my involvement, and perhaps someone will believe them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3931;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3932;The hanami at [From.GetTitledName]'s capital is mainly taking place beneath the cherry trees in the garden. I have seen well-tended gardens in the past, but the garden of [From.GetTitledName] is one of the best I have encountered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3932;I really like it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3933;[From.GetTitledName] appears to be awestruck at the state of my garden, and has been heard praising the work that has been done there in preparation for the hanami. Evidently, I made the right decision to improve it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3933;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3934;While the cherry trees in [From.GetTitledName]'s garden are in full bloom, the effect is somewhat diminished by the poor state of the garden as a whole. It seems [From.GetTitledName] does not care about tending it at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3934;How unsightly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3935;I did not put a lot of effort into improving my garden before the start of the hanami, and [From.GetTitledName] appears to be horrified at the state of it as [From.GetSheHe] has been heard loudly complaining about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3935;Not great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3936;While [From.GetTitledName] has prepared some diversions during the hanami [From.GetSheHe] does not appear to have seen fit to hire any entertainers despite it being a perfect occasion to bring out some shirabyoshi to entertain everyone present.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3936;This is boring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3937;[From.GetTitledName] has been complaining loudly about the lack of shirabyoshi where all of the guests could overhear [From.GetHerHim]. Perhaps I should have paid for some entertainment to avoid upsetting [From.GetHerHim] and everyone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3937;Not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3938;The shirabyoshi I hired to entertain my guests did not show up on time, and as more and more time passes I slowly realize that they probably are not coming. Given that they have not seen fit to send an explanation they have probably just left with my money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3938;Thieves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3939;[From.GetTitledName] has been claiming that there would be shirabyoshi entertaining the guests at some point during the hanami, but they never made an appearance, and [From.GetTitledName] has offered no explanation as to why they did not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3939;Were any actually hired?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3940;The shirabyoshi I hired show up on time and start to entertain the guests with their music and dancing. However, I quickly realize that they are not particularly skilled in their chosen field, and the entertainment is not particularly enjoyable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3940;I want my money back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3941;[From.GetTitledName] has hired some shirabyoshi to entertain everyone at the hanami, but they are not particularly good as their songs are off-key and their dancing is uncoordinated at best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3941;Make them stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3942;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledName], has hired some shirabyoshi to perform at [From.GetHerHis] hanami, and I find their entertainment inspiring. I have the opportunity to approach them to ask for advice on a certain skill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3942;Teach me how to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3942;Tell me about business!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3942;Tell me about poetry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3942;Teach me to convince!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3943;It seems my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetBestName] has been inspired by the shirabyoshi I hired and has learned from them after talking with them for a while. Hopefully, this will be an advantage in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3943;It will certainly not hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3944;As I take a walk amongst the cherry trees on my own I come across [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. I have always been curious about whether the shirabyoshi know how to use the swords they wear, and when I inquire about it [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] suggests a duel to find out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3944;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3944;This is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3945;[From.GetTitledName] has approached me and let me know that [From.GetSheHe] and [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] are planning to duel one another as [From.GetTitledName] wants to know if the shirabyoshi can fight or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3945;I'll allow it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3945;This is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3946;My liege, [From.GetTitledName], has refused my request to duel [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], claiming that that is not the kind of entertainment [From.GetSheHe] hired the shirabyoshi to perform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3946;I could have taken her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3947;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] were apparently planning to fight a duel to find out if the latter only carries a sword for show or if she actually knows how to use it, but it would seem [From.GetTitledName] has forbidden it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3947;It could have been fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3948;My liege, [From.GetTitledName], has approved my request to duel [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. As the final preparations are being made I need to determine how I will approach the duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3948;I will hold back a bit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3948;I will fight fairly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3948;I will fight dirty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3948;I will fight to kill!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3949;[From.GetTitledName] will soon be fighting me in a duel to find out if I can fight or if my sword is just for show. I need to decide how I want to approach the duel carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3950;It seems [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi] will soon be fighting a duel, supposedly because [FromFrom.GetTitledName] is curious about whether shirabyoshi know how to fight. Perhaps it will be for show, or perhaps the two combatants will try to kill one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3950;This should be fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3952;The duel between me and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] is not over in an instant, but I gain the upper hand relatively quickly and keep the pressure up until I can manage to disarm the shirabyoshi.\n\n"The fight is yours, my [Root.GetLordLady]," she says, bowing her head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3952;Well fought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3952;Was that all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3952;And now you die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_3953;[From.GetTitledName]'s duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] was a bit more drawn out than expected, but eventually [From.GetTitledName] prevailed. Surprisingly enough, [From.GetTitledName] still seemed convinced that [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] was a competent fighter, complimenting her for putting up a good fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_3953;[From.GetTitledName]'s duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] was a bit more drawn out than expected, but eventually [From.GetTitledName] prevailed. However, instead of being a good winner [From.GetTitledName] decided to mock the shirabyoshi for thinking that she had a chance in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3953;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_3954;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] managed to win [FromFrom.GetHerHis] duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], even if it was not a quick victory. It seems as if the shirabyoshi impressed [FromFrom.GetTitledName], though, since [FromFrom.GetSheHe] saw fit to compliment her skills after the duel was over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_3954;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] managed to win [FromFrom.GetHerHis] duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], even if it was not a quick victory. Upon disarming the shirabyoshi [FromFrom.GetTitledName] saw fit to be a poor winner and mocked the shirabyoshi for challenging [FromFrom.GetHerHim] in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3954;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3955;[From.GetTitledName]'s duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] was a bit more drawn out than expected, but eventually [From.GetTitledName] prevailed. However, apparently simply disarming the shirabyoshi was not good enough for [From.GetTitledName] as [From.GetSheHe] decided to strike down the unarmed woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3955;How uncivilized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3956;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] managed to win [FromFrom.GetHerHis] duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], even if it was not a quick victory. The shirabyoshi surrendered upon losing her sword, but [FromFrom.GetTitledName] did not see fit to let her live and struck her down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3956;How uncivilized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3957;My duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] goes on for quite some time with neither of us getting the upper hand, and eventually [FromFromFromFrom.GetTitledName] declares it a draw. I need to decide whether I should claim I held back or if I should acknowledge her skill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3957;You're good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3957;I held back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3958;[From.GetTitledName] and [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s duel went on for a considerable amount of time without either party getting the upper hand, and eventually you had to declare it a draw. Surprisingly, [From.GetTitledName] saluted the shirabyoshi and praised her skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3958;Was she that good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3959;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s duel was indecisive, and [From.GetTitledName] eventually had to call it a draw. Surprisingly enough, this outcome appears to have been acceptable for [FromFrom.GetTitledName] as [FromFrom.GetSheHe] saluted the shirabyoshi at the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3959;Was she that good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3960;[From.GetTitledName] and [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s duel went on for a considerable amount of time without either party getting the upper hand, and eventually you had to declare it a draw. [From.GetTitledName] loudly claimed that [From.GetSheHe] held back as [From.GetSheHe] sheathed [From.GetHerHis] sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3960;Sore loser...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3961;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]'s duel was indecisive, and [From.GetTitledName] eventually had to call it a draw. As [FromFrom.GetSheHe] sheathed [FromFrom.GetHerHis] sword, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] loudly claimed that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] was holding back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3961;Sore loser...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3962;My duel against [From.GetTitledName] is not completely one-sided, but I gain the upper hand eventually and manage to disarm [From.GetHerHim]. I could demand [From.GetHerHis] surrender at this point, or just strike [From.GetHerHim] down where [From.GetSheHe] stands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3962;Well fought, my [From.GetLordLady]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3962;All who oppose me must die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3964;My duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] does not go well. It is not entirely one-sided, but eventually the shirabyoshi prevails and manages to disarm me, and I am forced to yield. I might be able to claim that I did not fight at my full potential, should I wish to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3964;Well fought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3964;I held back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3965;[From.GetTitledName]'s duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] was not particularly even, and eventually the shirabyoshi triumphed. Surprisingly enough, [From.GetTitledName] did not seem to have an hard feelings towards [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], and instead praised her skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3965;Was she that good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3966;[From.GetTitledName] did not prevail in [From.GetHerHis] duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. However, instead of trying to save face, [From.GetTitledName] decided to praise the shirabyoshi's skills after the fight was over, which seemed to please her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3966;Was she that good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3967;[From.GetTitledName]'s duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] was not particularly even, and eventually the shirabyoshi triumphed. As the shirabyoshi walked away [From.GetTitledName] loudly proclaimed that [From.GetSheHe] was holding back the whole time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3967;Sore loser...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3968;[From.GetTitledName] did not prevail in [From.GetHerHis] duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. As the shirabyoshi sheathed her sword and started to walk away [From.GetTitledName] started to claim that [From.GetSheHe] was holding back the whole time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3968;Sore loser...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3969;My duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] does not go well. It is not entirely one-sided, but eventually the shirabyoshi prevails and manages to disarm me. Before I have the chance to yield she raises her sword again and cuts me down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3969;NOOOOO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3970;[troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] managed to prevail against [From.GetTitledName] in their duel, and the shirabyoshi was not content with simply defeating her opponent. Before [From.GetTitledName] manages to surrender [From.GetSheHe] was cut down by [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3970;How uncivilized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3970;Imprison that woman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3971;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] did not win [FromFrom.GetHerHis] duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], and the shirabyoshi was completely merciless on victory, striking [FromFrom.GetTitledName] down where [FromFrom.GetSheHe] stands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3971;How uncivilized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3972;Amongst the shirabyoshi I hired [remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] truly stands out as exceptional, and she offers to stay at my court after the hanami is over. This is too good an opportunity to turn down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3972;Stay as long as you like!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3973;One of the shirabyoshi [From.GetTitledName] hired, [From.remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], has proven to be a far better performer than the average shirabyoshi, and I am not surprised when I learn that she will become a permanent member of [From.GetTitledName]'s court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3973;Good for [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3975;There is always a risk that the weather will be bad during the day of the hanami, which can ruin the experience, but the weather could not have been better this time, and everyone can fully enjoy the festivities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3975;I couldn't have picked a better date!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3976;I have had some fun when spending my time with [From.hanami_friend_2.GetBestName] at [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami. Perhaps this is the start of a true friendship?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3976;Let's be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3976;I think I have enough friends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3977;[From.GetBestName] appears to like my company at [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s hanami quite a bit, and I also enjoy their company. It comes as no surprise when [From.GetBestName] suggests the two of us should become friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3977;Let's be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3977;Let's not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_3978;[From.GetBestName] seems to have enjoyed my company too, as [From.GetSheHe] is happy to declare me [From.GetHerHis] friend. Surely, this is the start of a beautiful friendship!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_3978;It would seem [From.GetBestName] has not enjoyed my company as much as I have enjoyed spending time with [From.GetHerHim], seeing as [From.GetSheHe] just told me that [From.GetSheHe] has no interest in becoming my friend friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_SOH_3978;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3978;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3979;During [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami [From.hanami_rival_2.GetBestName] has been extremely poor company, and I cannot help but to feel insulted by the way they speak to me. Perhaps I should demand an apology?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3979;It's the least I am owed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3979;Let's not make this worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3980;[From.GetBestName] appears to have taken some things I have said during [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s hanami personally, and [From.GetSheHe] has demanded that I apologize for the things I have said.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3980;I will never apologize! For anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3980;Of course I'll apologize!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_3981;[From.GetBestName] refused to apologize to me. It is clear that this is the start of a rivalry between the two of us, as [From.GetSheHe] clearly cannot be trusted to behave in a civilized fashion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_3981;[From.GetBestName] apparently did not mean the things [From.GetSheHe] said before and has apologized over the perceived insult, seemingly sincerely sorry to have offended me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3981;I hate you too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3981;Apology accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3982;During the hanami I come across [arguing_hanami_vassal_1.GetBestName] and [arguing_hanami_vassal_2.GetBestName] loudly arguing with one another. I cannot tell what the reason for their quarrel is, but perhaps I could try to smooth things over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3982;Try to calm them down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3982;Quietly walk away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3983;It seems my attempt to smooth things over has been successful, for [arguing_hanami_vassal_1.GetBestName] and [arguing_hanami_vassal_2.GetBestName] quickly calm down and are conversing as friends again by the time I am walking away from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3983;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3984;During [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami I and and another vassal ended up arguing over a misunderstanding. Luckily, [From.GetTitledName] managed to clear up the misunderstanding and I now know that there was no reason to get angry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3984;Thanks for the help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3985;My attempt to meddle in the argument between [arguing_hanami_vassal_1.GetBestName] and [arguing_hanami_vassal_2.GetBestName] did not go well, and they are now angry with both me and one another. Perhaps it would have been better if I had not meddled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3985;Not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3986;During [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami I and another vassal ended up arguing with one another. [From.GetTitledName] apparently thought that [From.GetSheHe] could be a diplomat and clear things up, but [From.GetSheHe] only made things worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3986;This is not a minor misunderstanding!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3987;A priestess from a nearby shrine made an unexpected appearance at my hanami, offering to say a few words and to make a small offering to the kami in my name after I welcomed her to the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3987;Sure, why not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3988;As [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami continues I find myself talking to [From.hanami_lover_2.GetBestName], a very lovely [From.hanami_lover_2.GetManWoman]. I cannot tell for sure, but they might be interested in me in a romantic way, and it would be easy to slip away into the night with them if they agree to it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3988;I will try to seduce them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3988;It is too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3989;I have been talking to [From.GetBestName] for quite some time at [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s hanami and think that they are a fine [From.GetManWoman]. It does not surprise me particularly much when [From.GetSheHe] suggests that the two of us should find someplace private to get to know one another more closely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3989;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3989;No, I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3990;[From.GetBestName] did not seem to appreciate my attempt to get to know them intimately, and [From.GetSheHe] hastily ended our conversation and hurried away. Hopefully, they will not speak of my suggestion with anyone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3990;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3991;[From.GetBestName] was amenable to my suggestion to slip away into the darkness to get to know one another intimately, and it is not long before we find a secluded part of [FromFromFrom.GetTitledName]'s garden and start to get undressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3991;It is good to be the [Root.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3992;I have taken a short break from the festivities and am taking a walk through a secluded part of my garden when I hear a sound from behind some bushes. I go around them and find [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] entwined with one another, neither of them wearing any clothes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3992;I saw nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3992;I wonder what my silence is worth...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3992;Everyone will hear about this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3993;[From.GetTitledName] stumbled upon me and [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] in a compromising position, but it appears that [From.GetSheHe] is content to keep it secret, at least for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3993;Phew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3994;[From.GetTitledName] stumbled upon me and [FromFrom.GetBestName] in a compromising position, but it appears that [From.GetSheHe] is content to keep it secret, at least for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3994;Phew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3995;[From.GetTitledName] discovered me and [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] together in a compromising position. Before either of us could speak [From.GetTitledName] asked us what [From.GetHerHis] silence is worth to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3995;I'll pay you some gold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3995;I'll owe you a Favor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3995;I won't be blackmailed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPA_SOH_3995;I will pay 25 gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPB_SOH_3995;I will owe a Favor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3996;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] discovered me and [From.GetBestName] together in a compromising position. Before either of us can speak [FromFrom.GetTitledName] asked us what [FromFrom.GetHerHis] silence is worth to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3997;Both [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] agreed to pay me to keep their tryst secret without any complaints.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3997;I will keep it secret, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPA_SOH_3997;[This.GetBestName] pays me 25 gold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPB_SOH_3997;[This.GetBestName] owes me a Favor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3998;I could not get [hanami_lover_1.GetBestName] and [hanami_lover_2.GetBestName] to agree to any concessions in exchange for my silence, and this leaves me no option but to expose their tryst to everyone at the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3998;You asked for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3999;[From.GetTitledName] has outed my tryst to everyone at the hanami, and since there is no possible way for me to attempt to cover up the situation the scandal is a fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3999;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4000;[From.GetTitledName] somehow caught wind of the fact that [FromFrom.GetBestName] and [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] were sleeping together, and has outed their relationship to everyone at the hanami. Given that the two were discovered together in a state of undress there is no plausible alternative explanation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4000;How scandalous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4000;They will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4000;I will not forgive this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4001;It seems the sounds from my hanami carries well beyond my garden, seeing as some of the townspeople have sent a messenger asking me to try to quiet things down a bit so that they can sleep properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4001;We'll tone it down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4001;Shut up, peasant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4002;In the middle of the night I can see something or someone moving about in the darkness just at the edge of my vision. I cannot tell who or what it is, and it might just be my mind playing tricks on me, but that is not certain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4002;Who goes there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4002;Guards! GUARDS!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4003;I have made sure that there is plenty of sake for the guests at my hanami, and I know for sure that there is enough to go around even if I have some. Surely there is no harm in drinking some?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4003;A little wouldn't hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4003;I'm thirsty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4003;I can't stop myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4004;The cherry blossoms at the hanami are certainly inspiring, and I find myself in the mood for writing some poetry. Perhaps I should challenge [From.GetTitledName] to a poetry contest?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4004;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4004;I'd rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4005;[From.GetTitledName] appears to feel inspired by the cherry blossoms and has suggested that the two of us should compete with one another in a poetry contest. I can of course turn it down, but maybe it would be fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4005;Challenge accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4005;Maybe another time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4006;It would seem [From.GetTitledName] has no interest in poetry as [From.GetSheHe] turned down my challenge to a poetry content, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] had better things to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4006;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4008;After I and my opponent have written our poems we hand them over to some of the other guests to read so that they may choose a winner. After some deliberation they decide that I have won.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4008;I am a poet now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4008;That was nice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4008;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4009;After I and my opponent have written our poems we hand them over to some of the other guests to read so that they may choose a winner. After some deliberation they decide that I have lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4009;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4010;[From.hanami_duel_vassal_2.GetBestName] has insulted me during the hanami, and I would be well within my rights to challenge them to a duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4010;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4010;Let's not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4011;Apparently [From.GetBestName] feels that I have insulted [From.GetHerHim] at the hanami, and [From.GetSheHe] is now challenging me to a duel. However, if I apologize the duel could be avoided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4011;Bring it on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4011;I'm sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4012;It appears [From.GetBestName] does not wish to fight me, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] instead has apologized for upsetting me. Perhaps it is for the best to let the matter rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4012;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_4013;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. The duel has already taken place, and [From.GetTitledName] has triumphed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_4013;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. The duel has already taken place, and neither came out ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_SOH_4013;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. The duel has already taken place, and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] has triumphed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4013;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_4014;I and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, and I eventually gain the upper hand, disarming them easily enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_4014;I and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, but it becomes clear that neither of us can get the upper hand, and eventually we decide to end the duel without a winner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_SOH_4014;I and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, and they eventually gain the upper hand. Before long I have been disarmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_SOH_4014;I and [From.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, and they eventually gain the upper hand. Before long I have been disarmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_SOH_4014;I and [From.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, but it becomes clear that neither of us can get the upper hand, and eventually we decide to end the duel without a winner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCF_SOH_4014;I and [From.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, and you eventually gain the upper hand, disarming them easily enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4014;Yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4014;Let's call it a draw!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4014;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4014;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_4014;Let's call it a draw!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_4014;Yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_4015;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. The duel has already taken place, and [From.GetTitledName] has triumphed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_4015;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. The duel has already taken place, and neither came out ahead in the duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_SOH_4015;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. The duel has already taken place, and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] has triumphed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4015;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4016;[From.GetTitledName] has has several truly magnificient meals prepared for the hanami. Doubtlessly, [From.GetSheHe] would like to hear if [From.GetHerHis] guests liked the food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4016;Approve publicly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4016;Disapprove publicly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4016;Stay silent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4017;[From.GetTitledName] has has several decent meals prepared for the hanami. Doubtlessly, [From.GetSheHe] would like to hear if [From.GetHerHis] guests liked the food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4018;[From.GetTitledName] has has several rather plain meals prepared for the hanami. Doubtlessly, [From.GetSheHe] would like to hear if [From.GetHerHis] guests liked the food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4019;Apparently, [From.GetTitledName] likes the quality of the food I had my servants prepare for the hanami and has seen fit to publicly praise you for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4019;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4020;Apparently, [From.GetTitledName] does not like the quality of the food I had my servants prepare for the hanami and has seen fit to publicly complain about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4020;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4022;As the hanami continues I come across [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] several more times and find her company enjoyable. Perhaps the two of us should try to get to know one another better?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4022;We should be lovers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4022;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4022;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4023;It seems [From.GetBestName] fancies me as [From.GetSheHe] has suggested that we should retire to [From.GetHerHis] bedchamber to get to know one another more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4023;I like how [From.GetSheHe] thinks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4023;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4024;[From.GetBestName] proved to be amenable to my suggestion, and soon the two of us have managed to find our way to my bedchamber. It does not take long before the two of us are fully undressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4024;This is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4025;It seems [From.GetBestName] has no interest in becoming my lover, seeing as she turned down my suggestion and quickly hurried away. Perhaps she will change her mind in the future, but it will not happen during the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4025;I see..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4026;[From.GetBestName] seems to have taken an interest in getting to know me better after our duel, and now it seems [From.GetSheHe] wishes to be my friend. The question is, do I think [From.GetSheHe] would make a good friend?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4026;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4026;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4027;[From.GetBestName] is elated when I propose that the two of us should begin a long-term friendship. Regardless of how the duel went, it seems we can put your differences aside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4027;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4028;It seems [From.GetBestName] has no interest in becoming my friend. Perhaps the events surrounding my duel with her are to blame, but it is possible that that is not the only reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4028;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4029;[shirabyoshi_foe.GetBestName] did not treat me courteously at the end of my duel with [shirabyoshi_foe.GetHerHim]. As the hanami continues I believe that I see an opportunity to kill [shirabyoshi_foe.GetHerHim], and I consider taking advantage of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4029;[shirabyoshi_foe.GetSheHeCap] must die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4029;It is too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4030;As I am walking by myself in a secluded part of [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s garden, [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] appears out of nowhere with her sword in her hand. With a loud war cry she moves to attack me, clearly wishing to kill me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4030;Try to fight her;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4030;Try to flee;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4031;Somehow I manage to slip away from [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] in the garden without being wounded. I suspect that she still is looking for me, and waste no time before ordering her arrest when I encounter some of the guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4031;Find that woman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4032;It seems [From.GetBestName] has been attacked by [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], the shirabyoshi [From.GetSheHe] fought a duel against previously. The attack was unsuccessful, but so was the attempt to apprehend the shirabyoshi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4032;Let her run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4033;I make my best attempt to slip away from [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], but in my haste I trip over a rock and fall to the ground. Before I can get back to my feet or draw my sword the shirabyoshi is upon me, and she shows me no mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4033;NOOOOOO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4034;Some of my guards stumbled upon the lifeless body of [From.GetBestName] in the garden. It would seen that an unknown assailant attacked [From.GetHerHim] and killed [From.GetHerHim], presumably with a sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4034;Who could have done this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4034;I have some suspicions, but...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4034;The shirabyoshi did it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4035;I draw my sword and meet [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] head on. The shirabyoshi is a decent enough fighter, as I learned before, but she is no match for me, and I manage to find an opening and quickly strike her down without her inflicting so much as a scratch on me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4035;Now we know the better fighter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4036;[From.GetBestName] returns after having taken a walk alone elsewhere in my garden and quickly informs me that [From.GetSheHe] was attacked by [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] and was forced to kill her in self-defense, taking no wounds in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4036;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4037;I draw my sword and meet [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] head on. The shirabyoshi is a decent enough fighter, as I learned before, and she inflicts several wounds on me before I manage to strike her down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4037;That will probably scar...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4038;[From.GetBestName] returns after having taken a walk alone elsewhere in my garden, and quickly informs me that [From.GetSheHe] was attacked by [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] and was forced to kill her in self-defense. Judging by [From.GetHerHis] wounds, [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] did not go down without a fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4038;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4039;I draw my sword and meet [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] head on. The shirabyoshi is a good fighter, as I learned before, and though I manage to strike her down in the end she has severely wounded me in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4039;At least I survived...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4040;[From.GetBestName] returns after having taken a walk alone elsewhere in my garden, severely injured, but with a smile on [From.GetHerHis] face. Apparently, [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] attacked [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetSheHe] narrowly managed to beat her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4040;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4041;I draw my sword and meet [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] head on. The shirabyoshi is a good fighter, and she manages to find an opening in my defenses quickly enough, drawing blood. One wound becomes two, then three, and eventually I lack the strength to keep her from striking me down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4041;NOOOOOO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4042;Some of my guards stumbled upon the lifeless body of [From.GetBestName] in the garden. As the shirabyoshi [From.GetSheHe] fought earlier, [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], is nowhere to be found it seems that she killed [From.GetHerHim] and then fled before the body was discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4042;Let her run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4043;The shirabyoshi I fought before, [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], was a competent fighter, which resulted in humiliation for me. Still, I believe I know her weaknesses now, and I think I see an opportunity to kill her, if I wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4043;She must die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4043;It would be a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4044;I surprise [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], though not to such an extent that she is unable to put up some resistance. However, the fight quickly turns in my favor, and I manage to kill her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4044;I win this time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4045;I surprise [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], though not to such an extent that she is unable to put up some resistance, and she manages to inflict several minor wounds before the fight turns in my favor and I manage to cut her down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4045;'Tis but a scratch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4046;I surprise [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], though not to such an extent that she is unable to put up some resistance. She manages to get in several good strikes, and I do not walk away from the fight in one piece despite eventually cutting her down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4046;At least I still live...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4047;It seems [From.GetBestName] has attacked [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] in my garden. It is doubtful that it was in self-defense, but I cannot punish [From.GetBestName] without knowing for sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4047;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4048;[troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] is not surprised as I move to attack her, and she meets me with her sword drawn. Before long, the fight turns against me, and eventually she strikes me down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4048;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4049;[troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] is not surprised as I move to attack her, and she meets me with her sword drawn. Though I manage to wound her the fight turns against me, and eventually she strikes me down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4049;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4050;[troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] is not surprised as I move to attack her, and she meets me with her sword drawn. I make sure that she will not walk away in one piece, but the fight turns against me, and eventually she strikes me down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4050;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4051;[troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] demands to speak with me, and I agree to her request. She tells me that [From.GetBestName] attacked her in my garden and that she was forced to kill [From.GetHerHim] in self-defense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4051;You did the right thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4051;Leave my court, now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4051;Guards, seize her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4052;Apparently, [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been killed by [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. According to the shirabyoshi, it was in self-defense, and [From.GetTitledName] apparently believes her, allowing her to remain free and at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4052;She should be imprisoned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4053;Apparently, [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been killed by [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. According to the shirabyoshi, it was in self-defense, and [From.GetTitledName] apparently believes her, allowing her to remain free, though not at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4053;She should be imprisoned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4054;Apparently, [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been killed by [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. According to the shirabyoshi, it was in self-defense, but [From.GetTitledName] still has seen fit to imprison her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4054;Serves her right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4055;[From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]'s skill with a sword was most impressive, and I have decided to learn from her. She teaches me quite a few tricks in a surprisingly short amount of time, and I find that we have more in common than an interest in swordfighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4055;I have a new friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4056;It seems [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] and [From.GetBestName] have become friends and that the shirabyoshi is teaching my [GetFromRelation] how to fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4056;That's... good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4057;[remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] is a most impressive woman, and I find that I am enjoying spending time with her. Perhaps we can get to know each other better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4057;I will try to seduce her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4057;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4057;No, this is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4058;[From.GetTitledName] seems to have been enjoying my performance throughout the hanami, and it does not come as a big surprise when [From.GetSheHe] suggests that perhaps I should come with [From.GetHerHim] somewhere more private for a different form of entertainment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4058;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4058;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4059;[From.GetBestName] agreed to my suggestion that the two of us should retire to somewhere private, and it does not take very long before both of us are undressed and getting to know one another more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4059;It is good to be the [Root.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4060;My suggestion that I and [From.GetBestName] should retire to somewhere private was not appreciated by the shirabyoshi, and she hastily excused herself and headed elsewhere. While still in my court, it seems like she will not be in my bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4060;Not as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4061;It seems [From.GetTitledName] truly is enjoying my company, and that [From.GetSheHe] wishes to remain on good terms with me. Indeed, [From.GetSheHe] has suggested that we perhaps should be friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4061;Let's be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4061;I'd rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4062;[From.GetBestName] seems very open to the idea of being friends with me. Doubtlessly this will only mean good things for me as she truly is a remarkable woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4062;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4063;Despite me generous suggestion [From.GetBestName] does not seem open to the idea of becoming friends with me. Perhaps it will change over time, but perhaps not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4063;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4064;[remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] does not cease to impress as the hanami continues. Her singing voice is beautiful, her dancing is impeccable, and her poetry is awe-inspiring. I could not have found a better shirabyoshi for my hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4064;She truly is amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4065;[From.remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], one of the shirabyoshi [From.GetTitledName] hired for [From.GetHerHis] hanami, truly is something special. Her singing voice is beautiful, her dancing is impeccable, and her poetry is awe-inspiring. I am not sure I have ever seen better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4065;She truly is amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4066;The shirabyoshi I hired for the hanami have performed quite well throughout the event. While none of them are truly exceptional, there is no doubt that they still are well-trained entertainers fit to entertain the likes of me and my guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4066;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4067;The shirabyoshi [From.GetTitledName] hired for [From.GetHerHis] hanami are quite good. They are not the kind of great shirabyoshi I am unlikely to see more than a few times in a lifetime, but they are certainly not bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4067;Keep on performing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4068;The shirabyoshi [From.GetTitledName] hired for [From.GetHerHis] hanami are getting on my nerves. While they are unfailingly polite towards everyone else, the behaviour they show towards me is anything but polite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4068;I want them gone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4069;[From.GetTitledName] has told ne that [From.GetSheHe] feels that the shirabyoshi I hired are being extremely impolite towards [From.GetHerHim], and has asked me to expel them from the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4069;Throw them out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4069;They can stay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4070;[From.GetTitledName] agreed to throw out the shirabyoshi as I requested. There will be less entertainment now, but at least the impolite shirabyoshi are not going to ruin the hanami for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4070;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4071;[From.GetTitledName] did not believe me when I claimed that the shirabyoshi were being rude towards me, and [From.GetSheHe] has decided to allow them to stay at the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4071;Why take their side?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4072;I have been spending some time with [From.hanami_child_friend_rival.GetBestName] at [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami, and [From.hanami_child_friend_rival.GetSheHe] seems to have a lot in common with me. Perhaps I should attempt to become [From.hanami_child_friend_rival.GetHerHis] friend?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4072;Yes, let's do that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4072;I have enough friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4073;[From.GetBestName] and I have spent some time together at [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s hanami, and I have enjoyed [From.GetHerHis] company. It seems the feeling is mutual, and [From.GetBestName] has suggested that we should be friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4073;Let's be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4073;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_4074;[From.GetBestName] seemed thrilled at the prospect of becoming my friend, and [From.GetSheHe] said that my company truly had been enjoyable at the hanami. Hopefully we will have more fun together in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_4074;It seems [From.GetBestName] does not enjoy my company as much as I enjoy [From.GetHerHis] company, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] found my suggestion that we should be friends silly and told me that it was not going to happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4074;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4074;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4075;[From.hanami_child_friend_rival.GetBestName] has been getting on my nerves during [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami, and I find that nearly everything [From.hanami_child_friend_rival.GetSheHe] says is a thinly veiled insult at best. Perhaps I should demand an apology?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4075;I deserve no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4075;It could be a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4076;It seems [From.GetBestName] has been taking your my at [From.GetHerHis] expense very seriously, and [From.GetSheHe] has demanded that I apologize. If not, chances are [From.GetBestName] will hold a grudge towards me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4076;I'm not sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4076;I'm sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_4077;[From.GetBestName] laughed in my face when I demanded an apology for [From.GetHerHis] insults. If [From.GetSheHe] is not going to attempt to be on friendly terms, I will have to treat [From.GetHerHim] as an enemy from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_4077;It seems [From.GetBestName] did not mean to insult me with the things [From.GetSheHe] said, and [From.GetSheHe] seemed most sincere when [From.GetSheHe] issued an apology. I cannot forget what was said, but it is probably best to forgive it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4077;I hate you too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4077;Fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4078;The weather takes a turn for the worse as the hanami progresses. Dark clouds cover the sky, and I can hear thunder in the distance. I might even have to move everyone inside if the situation gets worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4078;That's not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4079;One of my guards informs me that there is a fireworks merchant who wishes to see me. It turns out that he has heard of my hanami and that he is willing to sell me some fireworks to entertain my guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4079;I'll have some of the smaller ones!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4079;Give me a few larger ones!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4079;Give me everything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4079;I cannot afford any...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4080;The fireworks I bought from the merchant seem simple enough to use and I make sure that my guests all will have a good view of the sky before lighting them. The explosions are not particularly impressive, but it seems like the guests still liked the show.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4080;Worth the money, I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4081;[From.GetTitledName] has apparently gotten hold of some fireworks for the hanami. It is not exactly in line with tradition, and they are not the most impressive I have seen, but they are still somewhat entertaining.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4081;That was nice, I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4082;The fireworks I bought from the merchant are a bit complicated, but I manage to figure out how to use them. My guests seem impressed by the view as they light up the sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4082;Money well spent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4083;[From.GetTitledName] has a surprise for me and the other guests in the form of some fireworks [From.GetSheHe] apparently has bought. They light up the sky in a multitude of colors and are a sight to behold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4083;Beautiful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4084;I think I have figured out how to use the fireworks I bought from the merchant, but I get something wrong, and one of them explodes too close to me, and I do not get away in one piece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4084;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4085;[From.GetTitledName] has bought some fireworks for the hanami, but apparently [From.GetSheHe] has not figure out how to use them safely. One of the fireworks explodes right next to [From.GetHerHim], causing a major injury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4085;Play with fire...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4086;I am somewhat afraid of getting something wrong when I use the fireworks I bought, but luckily I get everything right, and the sky is soon set ablaze. Never before have I seen anything quite as magnificient as this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4086;A most impressive display!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4087;[From.GetTitledName] has everyone at the hanami gather where we can get a good view of the sky as [From.GetSheHe] starts setting off a large number of fireworks [From.GetSheHe] apparently has bought for the hanami. Before long, the sky is ablaze in a truly magnificient fashion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4087;A most impressive display!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4088;The fireworks I bought are more complicated than O initially thought, but I believe I have figured out how to use them safely by the time that my guests await the display. Unfortunately, something goes wrong, and I am badly injured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4088;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4089;[From.GetTitledName] brings out a large amount of fireworks and proudly proclaims that we are about to witness something grand. Unfortunately for [From.GetHerHim], the fireworks are less safe than expected, and [From.GetTitledName] is maimed in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4089;Play with fire...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4090;I manage to figure out how to set off the fireworks I bought without harming myself, but one of them flies off into the crowd and blows up right in the face of [fireworks_victim.GetBestName], killing [fireworks_victim.GetHerHim]. The remaining guests look at me in horror.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4090;It was an accident!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4091;[From.GetTitledName] has bought a number of huge fireworks from someone and brings them out at the hanami. [From.GetSheHeCap] manages to set them off without problems at first, but one of them spirals out of control and flies directly at me, blowing up in my face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4091;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4092;[From.GetTitledName] surprises everyone by bringing out a bunch of fireworks. Clearly, [From.GetSheHe] has a magnificient spectacle in mind, but something goes wrong and one of the fireworks hits [From.fireworks_victim.GetBestName] in the face, fatally wounding [From.fireworks_victim.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4092;What a mess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_4093;The Great Fireworks Disaster;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4093;My guests quickly assemble when they hear that I have prepared a grand fireworks display. Everything goes well at first, and the sky is soon lit by colorful explosions. However, before long, things go horribly wrong.\n\nSoon, there are fireworks flying off off into the town itself, impacting several buildings and starting a number of fires that grow out of control very quickly, and other fireworks strike some of my guests, killing them before they can react.\n\nBy the time that the last fireworks have gone off, many are dead, and large parts of [Root.Capital.GetName] are ablaze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4093;This is a disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_4094;The Great Fireworks Disaster;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4094;[From.GetTitledName] has proclaimed that there will be a major fireworks display during the hanami, and I and the other guests quickly gather to witness it.\n\nIt starts well enough, but soon there are fireworks flying off into the crowd and the nearby town, starting fires in several places and killing many people before they can escape to safety.\n\n[From.GetTitledName] is unhurt, and so am I, but it is clear that this disaster will not be something that [From.Capital.GetName] recovers from anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4094;That was a disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4095;I have taken some time to look at the stars during the hanami, and I am surprised by the appearance of a comet in the sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4095;It's an omen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_SOH_4095;Lose 1 stability;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4097;I and my spouse, [Root.Spouse.GetBestName], have been watching the stars together during the hanami while talking with one another, and I feel that I have gotten much closer to [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim] as a consequence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4097;I love [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4098;I and [hanami_child_friend.GetBestName] have been spending some time together watching the stars during the hanami, and I feel much closer to [hanami_child_friend.GetHerHim] now. In fact, I now consider [hanami_child_friend.GetHerHim] to be one of my best friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4098;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4099;The sky is clear during the night of the hanami, and the stars above are beautiful to behold. I would have loved to have someone to talk to about them, but it seems my guests are more interested in the cherry blossoms than the stars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4099;Those are also beautiful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4100;I and several others at the hanami have decided to take part in an impromptu sparring session in the hopes of improving our swordfighting skills. Hopefully, nothing will go wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4100;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_4101;I do not know why, but as soon as I draw my sword I feel certain that things will go well. I do not distinguish myself by having perfect form, but I show no fear against any of my opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_4101;Not long ago I found the idea of swordfighting dangerous, but during the sparring session I find that I actually have nothing to fear. Perhaps with a little effort I could learn excel at swordfighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_SOH_4101;I do not distinguish myself as much as some do at the sparring session. In fact, I perform worse than I had expected to, and some of the others seem to be hiding smiles as I excuse myself early to avoid further humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_SOH_4101;The sparring session does not go as well as I would have liked. I fumble with a parry and one of the others at the pracitice session accidentally gives me a shallow cut.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_SOH_4101;The sparring session goes very well for me, and I perform very well. Several of the others suggest that I could do well as a duelist, if that is something that interests me. If not, there is still some glory to be had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4101;I fear nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4101;I don't fear swords!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4101;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4101;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_4101;I will be a duelist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_4101;I'll just have the glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4102;I have spent some time at the hanami discussing military strategy with some of your vassals. The discussion went very well, and everyone seems to agree that I know quite a lot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4102;And here I thought I knew less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4102;I should study the Art of War...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4102;I will just have the fame!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4102;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_4102;Just as expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4103;During [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami I sent some time talking about military strategy with the other guests. The discussion went very well, and I got some praise for my knowledge in the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4103;And here I thought I knew less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4103;I should study the Art of War...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4103;I will just have the fame!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4103;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_4103;Just as expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4104;I took part in a discussion about military strategy during my hanami as some of my guests thought that it was a topic worth discussing, but unfortunately nothing I said seemed to impress anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4104;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4105;I spent some time at [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami discussing military strategy with the other guests. Unfortunately, the things I said during the discussion did not seem to impress anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4105;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4106;I and [hanami_go_opponent.GetBestName] found the time to play a game of Go during the hanami. It was not over quickly, and looked quite bad at times, but eventually I was victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4106;I should keep doing this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4106;Victory is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4107;[From.GetTitledName] challenged me to a game of Go during the hanami, and I obliged [From.GetHerHim]. It took some time for the outcome to be clear, but eventually it was clear that I had lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4107;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4108;I and [hanami_go_opponent.GetBestName] found the time to play a game of Go during the hanami. It took some time for the outcome to be clear, but eventually it was clear that I had lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4108;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4109;[From.GetTitledName] challenged me to a game of Go during the hanami, and I obliged [From.GetHerHim]. It was not over quickly, and it looked quite bad at times, but eventually I was victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4109;I should keep doing this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4109;Victory is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4110;The hanami has come to an end, and all of my guests have set off on their journey back home. I will have to wait at least one year before the next hanami can be held, seeing as the cherry blossoms will not bloom again for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4110;That was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4111;[From.GetTitledName]'s hanami is over, and it is time to head home. Whether there will be another hanami next year is unclear, but it certainly will have to wait that long since the cherry blossoms will not bloom again for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4111;That was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4112;With a war breaking out my hanami will have to be postponed, particularly as it is unlikely that the conflict will be over quickly enough for the matter to be resolved before the cherry blossoms are done blooming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4112;That's unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4113;[From.GetTitledName]'s hanami has unfortunately had to be cancelled due to a war breaking out, and it is doubtful that the war will be over before the cherry blossoms are gone for the year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4113;That's unfortunate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
### End hanami
### Gosannen War events
EVTDESC_SOH_4201;With the Tohoku region once more at peace it is time to decide what to do with the land I have acquired as part of the peace deal. If I'm not keeping it, I should also withdraw from the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4201;The land belongs to Fujiwara Kiyohira!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4201;The land belongs to Fujiwara Kiyohira!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4201;The land belongs to the Kiyohara clan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4201;The land belongs to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_4201;The land belongs to the Regent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_4201;The land belongs to the Chrysanthemum Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4202;Despite my assistance during the war and my rightful claim it seems like [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to declare that Mutsu is the rightful property of Fujiwara Kiyohira. Maybe I should dispute this by force of arms?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4202;No, there shall be peace...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4202;Summon my warriors! We march to Mutsu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4203;Though it was unclear at first if [From.GetBestName] would see fit to accept my decision to give Mutsu to Fujiwara Kiyohira [From.GetSheHe] seems to have accepted my decision and has agreed to enter into an agreement regarding a formal truce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4203;My work here is done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4204;It seems [From.GetBestName] is unwilling to accept the fact that Mutsu rightfully belongs to Fujiwara Kiyohira and my decision to give it to him, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to declare war to press [From.GetHerHis] claim on the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4204;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4205;Though I initially feared that [From.GetBestName] would have seen fit to keep Mutsu or to hand it off to someone else I have learned that [From.GetSheHe] is prepared to hand it over to me, recognizing my legal claim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4205;I am glad [From.GetSheHe] saw reason!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4206;I have just received word from the Tohoku region that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has seen fit to turn over Mutsu to [From.GetBestName] following the end of the Northern Disturbance, which apparently is agreeable to all involved parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4206;That's good news, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4206;I don't care about the north!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4207;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName] was not particularly interested to learn that I had been given control of the Tohoku region as a whole. If [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in what happens here, do I really want to remain an imperial subject?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4207;I am loyal to the Chrysanthemum Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4207;I will create my own realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4208;Despite my assistance in the war and my rightful claim it seems like [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to declare that [From.GetSheHe] should remain in control of Mutsu to ensure a lasting peace. Maybe I should dispute this by force of arms?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4208;No, there shall be peace...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4208;Summon my warriors! We march to Mutsu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4209;I intially feared that [From.GetBestName] would oppose my decision to retain control over Mutsu, but it seems [From.GetSheHe] has seen reason as [From.GetSheHe] has let it be known that [From.GetSheHe] is willing to sign a treaty stipulating a lasting truce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4209;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4210;It seems [From.GetBestName] views [From.GetHerHis] personal glory as more important than what is best for the Chrysanthemum Throne, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] has refused to accept my decision to retain control over Mutsu and has declared war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4210;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4211;[From.GetBestName] has finally secured peace in the Tohoku region, and instead of giving Mutsu to one of the claimants or keeping it for [From.GetHerselfHimself] [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to turn over the land to me so that I may distribute it as I see fit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4211;If only all subjects were this loyal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4212;To my great surprise, it seems [FromFrom.GetBestName] has seen fit to turn over Mutsu to [From.GetBestName] following the end of the Northern Disturbance. It would be seen as treasonous to object to this peace settlement, but I should not forget this slight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4212;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] should have given it to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4213;Though it seemed quite unlikely at first I have managed to come out ahead in the Northern Disturbance, and now I control the Tohoku region. Since the region is at peace I doubt the Chrysanthemum Throne will object.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4213;I think this is quite satisfactory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4214;I have just received word from the Tohoku region that the Northern Disturbance has come to an end, with [From.GetBestName] being the victor. [From.GetSheHeCap] is now in firm control of the Tohoku region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4214;That's good news, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4214;The north is irrelevant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4215;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName] was not particularly interested to learn that I control the Tohoku region as a whole due to my recent victory. If [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in what happens here, do I really need to remain an imperial subject?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4215;I am loyal to the Chrysanthemum Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4215;I will create my own realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4216;With the Tohoku region finally at peace I need to decide whether I wish to remain in the region or if I should hand it over to someone else and focus on other matters elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4216;I will give the north to Fujiwara Kiyohira!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4216;I will keep the north!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4216;I will give the north to the Regent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4216;I will give the north to the Chrysanthemum Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4217;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to recognize my rightful claim to the Tohoku region following the end of the Northern Disturbance and that [From.GetSheHe] will depart the region, leaving it in my capable hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4217;This will surely please everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4218;I have just received word from the Tohoku region that the Northern Disturbance has come to an end, with [From.GetBestName] being granted control of the region following [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4218;That's good news, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4218;The north is irrelevant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4219;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName] was not particularly interested to learn that I control the Tohoku region as a whole. If [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in what happens here, do I really need to remain an imperial subject?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4219;I am loyal to the Chrysanthemum Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4219;I will create my own realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4220;Despite previous assurances to do exactly that [From.GetBestName] has not seen fit to give me control of the Tohoku region following [From.GetHerHis] recent victory in the Northern Disturbance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4220;I won't forget this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4221;[From.GetBestName] has finally secured peace in the Tohoku region, and [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to turn over the land [From.GetSheHe] obtained to me so that I may distribute it as I see fit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4221;If only all subjects were this loyal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4222;To my great surprise, it seems [FromFrom.GetBestName] has seen fit to turn over Mutsu to [From.GetBestName] following the end of the Northern Disturbance. It would be seen as treasonous to object to this peace settlement, but I should not forget this slight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4222;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] should have given it to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4223;I have managed to come out ahead in the Northern Disturbance, and now I control the Tohoku region. Since the region is at peace I doubt the Chrysanthemum Throne will object to this outcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_4224;I have just received word from the Tohoku region that the Northern Disturbance has come to an end, with [From.GetBestName] being the victor. [From.GetSheHeCap] is now in firm control of the Tohoku region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_4225;I am loyal to the Chrysanthemum Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4225;I will create my own realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4226;With my realm finally at peace again the warrior bands that came to my aid are no longer needed, and it is time for them to disperse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4226;I can bring them back if I need them again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
### End Gosannen War
### Kitsune
EVTDESC_SOH_4301;One day when I am returning home just after dusk a young woman I have never seen before approaches me. She introduces herself as [new_kitsune_or_not.GetBestName] and humbly asks whether I could arrange for a place for her to stay as she expects to be in the area for a while and her previous arrangements have fallen apart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4301;I can find a place for you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4301;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4303;[From.GetBestName] has been staying at my court for a while now, and so far I have found her to be quite fascinating. She is also quite beautiful, and I cannot help but get the feeling that she might be interested in getting to know me quite a bit more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4303;I will approach her about it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4303;It would be inappropriate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4304;It seems [FromFrom.GetBestName] was not as interested in me as I had though. As soon as I made my suggestion she backs away from me, telling me to stay away from her. Within the hour I was informed that she was seen storming out the front gate, carrying all of her possessions with her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4304;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4305;[FromFrom.GetBestName] turns out to be quite receptive to my suggestion, and it seems she knows the layout of my residence nearly as well as I do as she easily found a secluded spot for the two of us to engage in lovemaking. Eventually, as I am getting dressed, she tells me that she can't wait for the next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4305;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4306;[FromFrom.GetBestName] turns out to be quite receptive to my suggestion, and it seems she knows the layout of my residence nearly as well as I do as she easily found a secluded spot for the two of us to engage in lovemaking. Much later, as I am getting dressed, I start to consider the future of our relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4306;This is all I want!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4306;I will make her a concubine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4306;I will marry her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4307;[From.GetBestName] and I have been getting closer and closer with each passing day. We might not have known each other very well at the start of our relationship, but now I am certain both of us have come to know and care about one another quite a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4307;This is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4309;One day as I am dealing with several routine tasks one of my servants brings me a sealed message bearing an unfamiliar seal. Opening it, I discover that it is a letter from  [FromFrom.GetBestName], informing me that she has left my court looking for other opportunities elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4309;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4311;[From.GetBestName] has been staying at my court for quite some time now, and I have long known that she has taken an interest in her surrounding. Today she approached me with a suggestion regarding some adjustments to the guards' patrol routes that she apparently thinks would make the place much more secure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4311;What a great idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4311;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4312;A few days after the guards have adjusted their patrol routes as suggested a servant comes running, informing me me that someone has broken into my treasury. A substantial amount of money appears to be missing, and it seems [FromFrom.GetBestName] also is nowhere to be found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4312;She fooled us all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4313;A few days after the guards have adjusted their patrol routes as suggested a servant comes running, informing me that the guards caught a thief about to break into my treasury. It seems the new patrol routes already have paid off, and that I owe [FromFrom.GetBestName] my thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4313;She truly is most helpful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4314;One day as I am dealing with several routine tasks one of my servants brings me a sealed message bearing an unfamiliar seal. Opening it, I discover that it is a letter from  [FromFrom.GetBestName], informing me that she has left my court looking for other opportunities elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4314;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4316;One day I return to my quarters to find a horrifying sight inside. [From.GetBestName] is standing there, drenched in blood and looking down at the unmoving bodies of several people close to me. Hearing me enter, she turns around and gives me a crazed smile, telling me that now nobody will keep us apart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4316;Guards! Bring me her head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4316;Guards! Toss her in the dungeon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4316;Guards! Leave me and my love!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4317;[From.GetBestName] has asked me to meet her and several others to discuss a matter of mutual interest, and as I have no other plans I have decided to humor the request. As soon as the last person arrives, [From.GetBestName] gets up from her seat and locks the door, and then she turns around, pulling free a dagger and giving us all a crazed smile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4317;No! Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4318;One day one of the servants comes running, informing me that [kitsune_rival.GetBestName] and [From.GetBestName] are having an argument. I head over to see if I can salvage the situation, but it quickly becomes clear that that is not going to be possible as they truly seem to dislike one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4318;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4319;I came across [FromFrom.GetBestName] one day when returning from a meeting with [From.GetBestName]. I inquired about her day, wishing to be polite, but for some reason she took it poorly and accused me of always treating her poorly. The situation quickly got worse from there, and soon we were both shouting at each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4319;I hate you too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4321;[From.GetBestName] asks to speak to me one day, telling me that while she is fond of me she has been considering matters of religion recently, and she has realized that she would prefer to take monastic vows and enter into the service of the Buddha.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4321;If that is your wish...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4321;I forbid it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4322;Though [FromFrom.GetBestName] has not brought up the matter of taking monastic vows again she has become rather distant, and though I remain fond of her it seems that she no longer feels the same way about me. Perhaps that will change in the future, but I feel anything but certain about that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4322;I think she might be mad at me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4323;The day after my conversation with [From.GetBestName] I discovered a sealed envelope addressed to me in my bedroom, clearly written in her handwriting. I opened it to discover that it was a note informing me that she has seen fit to head elsewhere in search of enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4323;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4324;Ever since I first came to know her, [From.GetBestName] has been known to get sick on almost a weekly basis. It has usually not been anything particularly serious, but every now and them she has had trouble recovering, and I just received word that she seems to be struggling with an illness once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4324;She really doesn't have it easy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4328;As I grow older my kitsune powers continue to grow, bit by bit. Usually, it is not really something I pay attention to, but as I woke up with a new tail this morning I am confident that my power just grew significantly. The humans surrounding me are unlikely to notice anything, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4328;They never do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4329;I have often heard humans speak of improving themselves, of changing who they are, whether in the name of spirituality, of glory, or of vanity. At times, I have found this appealing myself, but as I am not human there is only so much I can change about myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4329;I can't fight my nature!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4330;While it can be fun to play with the emotions of several humans at the same time I feel that doing so has resulted in me being overly lax when it comes to keeping [kitsune_target.GetBestName] wrapped around my finger, and I have resolved to focus my efforts on addressing that matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4330;I need to focus...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4331;A message arrived from [From.GetBestName] today, informing me that she no longer feels quite the same way about me as she once did. Perhaps she will change her mind in the future, but it seems that she wishes to keep me at a distance for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4331;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4332;[kitsune_target.GetBestName] and I have been at odds for some time, but as [kitsune_target.GetSheHe] is someone it is rather useful for me to keep close that is not really ideal, and I feel that it is time for our rivalry to end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4332;Time to end that nonsense...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4333;Though I and [From.GetBestName] have been at odds for some time I have always been somewhat fond of her, and today she approached me with a suggestion that we should put the past behind us. I cannot recall quite what her arguments were, but they were quite convincing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4333;It was just a misunderstanding!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4334;[kitsune_target.GetBestName] and I have been drifting apart lately, and though I am confident that I could find other humans to wrap around my finger there is something special about [kitsune_target.GetBestName] that makes me want to keep [kitsune_target.GetHerHis] attentions focused on me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4334;Time to turn on the charm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4335;[From.GetBestName] and I have been drifting apart lately as I had the feeling that she no longer was interested in me, but today she made certain to remind me just how much she cares about me, and my feelings for her certainly have not diminished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4335;I love her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4336;Though it is usually not terribly difficult for me to keep the attention of [kitsune_target.GetBestName] focused on me seeing as I have my kitsune powers available [kitsune_rival.GetBestName] has been getting in the way of my plans quite a bit, and I am starting to wonder if [kitsune_rival.GetSheHe] should be taken care of permanently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4336;Accidents happen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4336;...but not this time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4337;As I am about to fall asleep one evening I hear the sound of movement nearby and a knock on my door. I get out of bed and hurry to the door to open it, finding [From.GetBestName] outside. I can see a foxlike tail sticking out behind her, which I barely have time to take in as she lunges at me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4337;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4338;I have just received word that [kitsune_rival.GetBestName] has been found dead in her quarters, killed by an unknown attacker. Word appears to spread quickly about the murder, as [From.GetBestName] comes to see me before long, telling me that she worries that someone might come after her next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4338;I will keep you safe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4339;Though me attention currently is focused on [kitsune_target.GetBestName] I know the value of ensuring that others respect me and appreciate my presence. Lately, I have been having quite a few interactions with [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName], and [kitsune_courtier.GetSheHe] truly seems to have enjoyed my company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4339;I am good at this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4340;I have been spending some time in the company of [From.GetBestName] lately, and she truly is a fascinating woman, easily able to converse with me and others on a multitude of different subjects and always someone that can put a smile on anyone's face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4340;She's quite impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4341;I have noticed that [From.GetBestName] has been spending a lot of time in the company of [FromFrom.GetBestName] lately, and it seems [From.GetBestName] has found it quite enjoyable as [From.GetSheHe] has been heard praising [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s ability to provide entertaining conversation and good company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4341;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4342;Though my attention currently is focused on [kitsune_target.GetBestName] I know the value of ensuring that others respect me and appreciate my presence. Unfotunately, [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName] does not seem all that appreciative of my presence, and [kitsune_courtier.GetSheHe] might even suspect what I truly am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4342;I should have been more careful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4343;I have been spending some time in the company of [From.GetBestName] lately, and though she is a fascinating woman in many ways there is something about her that is just not quite right. I have not been able to put my finger on just what that is, but I probably should speak to [kitsune_target.GetBestName] about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4343;I must tell [kitsune_target.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4343;I'm not sure what I saw...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4344;I have noticed that [From.GetBestName] has been spending a lot of time in the company of [FromFrom.GetBestName] lately, and I had expected this to mean that they both enjoyed each other's company. However, it seems [From.GetBestName] thinks that [FromFrom.GetBestName] is not quite what she seems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4344;I don't believe [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4344;I will investigate this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4345;Though my warning about [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] has reached [From.GetBestName] [From.GetSheHe] has apparently decided that I must be imagining things, seeing as I have just received a letter telling me to not make such baseless accusations against [FromFromFrom.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4345;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4346;It seems [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName] suspects more than I would have expected and that [kitsune_courtier.GetSheHe] has seen fit to share what [kitsune_courtier.GetSheHe] suspects with [From.GetBestName], seeing as [From.GetSheHe] just confronted me about the accusations that I am not quite what I seem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4346;Time to end the charade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4346;Time to charm [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4347;I am able to locate [From.GetBestName] easily enough and quickly convince her to speak to me alone. When I reveal the accusations made by [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName], [From.GetBestName] lets out an annoyed sigh and transforms into a many-tailed fox before running off into the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4347;It's all true!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4348;I have just received word from [From.GetBestName] that [From.GetSheHe] confronted [FromFrom.GetBestName] about her unusual behaviour and that it turns out that something unusual indeed was going on, seeing as [FromFrom.GetBestName] apparently transformed into a many-tailed fox before running off into the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4348;I knew it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4349;It does not take much more than a few words, a quick touch, and the merest fraction of my kitsune powers to convince [FromFrom.GetBestName] that the accusations made against me by [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName] do not hold up to scrutiny, and that I most definitely am an ordinary human woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4349;Child's play!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4350;[From.GetBestName] is clearly surprised by the accusations that [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName] has made against her, telling me that she had thought that the two of them were friends. After considering the matter for a moment, she suggests that [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName] feels threatened by a beautiful and brillant woman such as herself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4350;She's right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4351;I have just received word from [From.GetBestName] that [From.GetSheHe] has spoken to [FromFrom.GetBestName] and that there is no reason for me to be suspicious of her. Moreover, [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] seem to think that I feel threatened by the fact that [FromFrom.GetBestName] is a beautiful and brillant woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4351;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4352;I had expected a few words, a quick touch, and the merest fraction of my kitsune powers to be enough to convince [FromFrom.GetBestName] that the accusations made against me by [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName] do not hold up to scrutiny, but [FromFrom.GetSheHe] seems unaffected by my attempt to convince [From.GetHerHim] and demands answers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4352;I tire of this game!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4353;[From.GetBestName] initially claims surprised by the accusations that [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName] has made against her, but after I refuse to drop the matter she lets out an annoyed sigh and transforms into a many-tailed fox before running off into the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4353;It's all true!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4354;I have just received word from [From.GetBestName] that [From.GetSheHe] confronted [FromFrom.GetBestName] about her unusual behaviour and that it turns out that something unusual was going on, seeing as [FromFrom.GetBestName] transformed into a many-tailed fox before running off into the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4354;I knew it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4355;I have known [From.GetBestName] for many years, and yet I am convinced that she looks very much the same as when I first met her, even though that seems impossible. Maybe she is using some kind of cosmetics I am unfamiliar with, or it is a trick of the light, but it might also be something rather less mundane.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4355;I'm imagining things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4355;I need to ask her...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4356;One of the disadvantages with staying in the same place for as long as I have is that people might start to notice that everything about me is not as it seems, and [From.GetBestName] has just confronted me about the fact that I do not seem to age at quite the same rate as anyone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4356;Time to end the charade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4356;Time to charm [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4357;I confront [From.GetBestName] about her unchanging appearance, and to my surprise she does not bother to attempt to defend herself. Instead, she lets out an annoyed sigh and turns into a many-tailed fox, running off into the distance before I can react to what just happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4357;I should have known!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4358;It does not take much more than a few words, a quick touch, and the merest fraction of my kitsune powers to convince [FromFrom.GetBestName] that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is imagining things, and [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is quick to apologize, telling me that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] clearly is mistaken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4358;Child's play!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4359;[From.GetBestName] is clearly surprised when I ask her about her unchanging appearance and is quick to point out that there are others around that have changed very little over the years as well. I consider her words and become more and more convinced that everything is as it should be and that nothing strange is going on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4359;I trust her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4360;I had expected a few words, a quick touch, and the merest fraction of my kitsune powers to be enough to convince [FromFrom.GetBestName] that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is imagining things, but [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is not so easily dissuaded, and it has become clear that I really have been staying in one place for far too long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4360;This ends now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4361;[From.GetBestName] seems surprised when I ask her about her unchanging appearance, but when I refuse to drop the matter until she presents an explanation she lets out an annoyed sigh and transforms into a many-tailed fox. I am so surprised by this that I do not notice that she has taken off running until she is far away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4361;I did not expect that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4362;There are many games kitsunes can play with humans, and some of them might seem a bit cruel. However, they all serve one purpose or another, and though it would be hard to give anyone an explanation I have started to consider whether [kitsune_target.GetBestName] should suffer a bout of illness just about now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4362;I have my needs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4362;...but I don't need this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4363;When I woke up in the morning I felt ready to take on the world, but over the course of the day I have become unwell, seemingly for no good reason. [From.GetBestName] has noticed this, and she has promised to do everything she can to help me recover as quickly as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4363;I'm glad she's here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4364;[kitsune_lesson_target.GetBestName] is growing up fast, and [kitsune_lesson_target.GetSheHe] probably does not suspect my true nature or the fact that it might result in trouble for [kitsune_lesson_target.GetHerHim] in the future. To help [kitsune_lesson_target.GetHerHim] survive, I have decided to give [kitsune_lesson_target.GetHerHim] a few lessons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4364;Mother knows best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4365;My mother, [From.GetBestName], took me on a trip into the forest today. Once there, she told me that she wanted to teach me a lesson to prepare me for the future, as there are those in the world that might resent me simply because I am her child. The lesson was a bit odd, but I had fun, and I learned some things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4365;Mother knows best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4366;Though I spend a lot of my time in the company of [kitsune_target.GetBestName] and others I occasionally find the opportunity to slip away for a few hours to visit the forest nearby, and particularly the foxes found in it. One day when I am enjoying their company a servant comes to find me, and she notices the foxes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4366;I was just taking a walk!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4367;Today one of my servants requested a moment of time to speak to me about [From.GetBestName]. Surprised by this request, I saw fit to grant it, and it turns out that the servant saw [From.GetBestName] spending time with a group of foxes in the forest earlier in the day and thought I would want to hear about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4367;Strange, but harmless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4368;One of the many powers I have as a kitsune is the power to enter the dreams of unsuspecting humans. This night, I decided to enter the dreams of [kitsune_dream_target.GetBestName], purely out of curiosity. I did not discover anything of interest, but I had the chance to affect what was happening a little, which was fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4368;That was time well spent...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4369;I do not tend to pay a lot of attention to my dreams, particularly not as I do not remember too many of them, but this night I had some very strange dreams involving various people I know, including [From.GetBestName], whose presence was significantly more pronounced than that of many others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4369;Such odd dreams...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4370;Though there are many reasons to seduce humans, including mere fun and the possibility of ensuring offspring, it is also a good way for a kitsune to replenish some of her magical energy, and today I made sure to drag [kitsune_target.GetBestName] into a secluded area for that purpose, keeping [kitsune_target.GetHerHim] there for hours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4370;I needed that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4371;[From.GetBestName] tends to be quite eager to make love to me, but I rarely find her as eager as she was today. She was quite insistent that I come with her into a secluded area where we would not be bothered, and once she had managed to get me where she wanted me she made sure to keep me there for several hours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4371;That was... exhausting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4372;Though my power is not inconsiderable there are those that seem all but unaffected by them. One such person is [kitsune_priest.GetBestName], who visited [kitsune_target.GetBestName] today to discuss matters of religion, and though I did my best to avoid [kitsune_priest.GetBestName] [kitsune_priest.GetSheHe] seemed quite suspicious of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4372;[kitsune_priest.GetSheHeCap] might know too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4373;[kitsune_priest.GetBestName] visited me today to discuss various matters of faith, which took up a considerable part of my day. After [kitsune_priest.GetSheHe] had left, [From.GetBestName] came to see me, saying that she would prefer if [kitsune_priest.GetSheHe] did not visit again as she finds [kitsune_priest.GetHerHim] quite disagreeable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4373;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4374;[kitsune_priest.GetBestName] seems to be suspecting that I am not quite human, as some of the people I have convinced to watch [kitsune_priest.GetHerHim] have reported that [kitsune_priest.GetSheHe] has been looking into mythological creatures lately and often has been heard muttering my name while doing so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4374;It's time for [kitsune_priest.GetHerHim] to die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4375;Word reached me today that [kitsune_priest.GetBestName] has been found dead and that many books about mythological beasts that were known to have been in [kitsune_priest.GetHerHis] possession have gone missing. [From.GetBestName] seems quite interested in the matter, and has instructed those investigating the murder to keep her informed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4375;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4376;It is somewhat embarrassing for me to have been imprisoned in the first place, but today I finally put my escape plan in motion. My kitsune powers were more than sufficient for the task, and it is unlikely that anyone will be able to figure out just how I escaped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4376;Free at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4377;As I am dealing with various routine matters one of my guards comes running and requests to speak with me, clearly distraught. I grant the request and learn that [From.GetBestName], formerly my prisoner, seems to have vanished without a trace, and that no one has been able to figure out how she got out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4377;I need better guards, it seems...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4378;Today [From.GetBestName] returned unexpectedly, having escaped captivity. She claims to have escaped because of the lax security measures put into place to keep her locked up, and knowing that guards often are not as eager to carry out their jobs as one would expect that could certainly be true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4378;I don't need the details...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4380_KITSUNE_MOTHER;Growing up, I have heard many people tell me that they always have considered my mother a rather strange woman. Some of the things they have told me have seemed strange indeed, and as I woke up today and discovered that I somehow had grown a fox tail overnight I have come to realize that your mother is not exactly human.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4380_KITSUNE_ANCESTOR;Today I woke up and discovered that I somehow had grown a fox tail overnight. I am fairly certain my mother is not a kitsune, but there has to be one among my ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4380;This explains so much!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

### End Kitsune
### Foreigner on your Shores
EVTDESC_SOH_4401;The peasants in [foreigner_landfall_province.GetName] recently encountered a foreign shipwreck. One of the surviving members of the crew is [foreigner_in_japan.GetBestName], a [foreigner_in_japan.GetManWoman] supposedly from [foreigner_origin_province.GetName]. [foreigner_in_japan.GetSheHeCap] has indicated that [foreigner_in_japan.GetSheHe] wishes to enter my service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4401;Foreginers are not welcome here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4401;I welcome you to my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4403;I have recently been spending some time in the company of [foreigners_target.GetBestName], and though the two of us had little knowledge of one another previously we are getting along quite well. In fact, I think the two of us are becoming friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4403;That can only mean good things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4404;I recently spent some time in the company of [From.GetBestName], and though [From.GetSheHe] was something of an unknown to me previously I feel that the two of us already have become friends. After all, we share quite a few opinions and interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4404;I'm sure this means good things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4405;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [foreigners_target.GetBestName] have gotten quite close as of late. It certainly is good to know that [From.GetBestName] can make friends this far from home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4405;Good for them, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4406;I have recently been spending some time in the company of [foreigners_target.GetBestName]. I had thought that maybe we could put our many differences aside, but it is clear that that is not the case, and I do not want to speak to [foreigners_target.GetHerHim] ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4406;I hate [foreigners_target.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4407;I recently spent some time in the company of [From.GetBestName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] was previously something of an unknown to me, and now I know more than enough about [From.GetHerHim] to tell that [From.GetSheHe] is a thoroughly unpleasant individual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4407;I hate [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4408;The latest court gossip that has reached my ears indicate that [From.GetBestName] and [foreigners_target.GetBestName] now hate each other. It is a bit unclear just what happened, but it appears to have been something recent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4408;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4409;Though I have long known that [From.GetBestName] considers [From.GetHerselfHimself] something of a warrior it was still quite surprising when [From.GetSheHe] approached me today and asked me to help [From.GetHerHim] join the Warriors of the Rising Sun, as that certainly is not what I would expect from a foreigner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4409;I will vouch for you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4409;I will train you myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4409;You don't deserve such an honor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4410;[From.GetBestName] has let me know that [From.GetSheHe] will vouch for me and that the Warriors of the Rising Sun should be willing to let me join based on that. [From.GetSheHeCap] has told me that this is quite the honor, and that [From.GetSheHe] expects great things from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4410;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4411;[From.GetBestName] has let me know that [From.GetSheHe] not only will support me when it comes to joining the ranks of the Warriors of the Rising Sun but that [From.GetSheHe] is going to handle my training [From.GetHerselfHimself], which certainly is a great honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4411;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4412;[From.GetBestName] laughed at my request to join the Warriors of the Rising Sun and firmly told me that [From.GetSheHe] considers me unworthy of that honor and that the Warriors of the Rising Sun doubtlessly agree with [From.GetHerHis] assessment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4412;Such arrogance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4413;One day when I am on the road several armed bandits approach me, clearly with ill intentions in mind. It is still possible for me to get away before they are close, but I could also ready a weapon and face them head on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4413;Time to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4413;Time to run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4414;The bandits are taken by complete surprise by my attack, and several of them fall before they realize that I have closed with them. The rest attempt to fight back, but their attempt to do so is quite feeble indeed, and soon I am the only one still standing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4414;A simple matter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4415;[From.GetBestName] returned home in good spirits today. When asked about it [From.GetSheHe] told me that [From.GetSheHe] encountered some bandits on the road, and that the ensuing fight went completely in [From.GetHerHis] favor, which made it a rather enjoyable encounter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4415;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4416;The bandits are taken by surprise by my attack, and one of them falls before they realize that I have closed with them. The rest attempt to fight back, but it does not really matter in the end. However, I am injured in the fight, so it was not as clean a victory as it could have been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4416;That hurt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4417;One day [From.GetBestName] returns home somewhat injured but still reasonably happy. [From.GetSheHeCap] later reveals that [From.GetSheHe] came across some bandits and that [From.GetSheHe] was injured in the ensuing fight. Seeing as the fight ended in victory, it could have gone worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4417;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4418;The bandits are ready when I move to attack them, and I am wounded quite quickly. Eventually, I manage to get the upper hand against them and force them all to run or die, but at that point I have taken a grievous wound that I doubt I ever truly will recover from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4418;They almost got me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4419;Today [From.GetBestName] returned home badly injured. [From.GetSheHeCap] is quickly tended to by various servants, even if they are unable to do much for [From.GetHerHim]. Based on what they tell me, [From.GetBestName] apparently fought a large number of bandits single-handedly and barely prevailed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4419;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4420;The bandits are ready when I move to attack them, and I get badly wounded early on in the battle. I do ,y best to fight on, but there is too many of them, and weight of numbers alone can decide a fight. It does not take long before I am lying on the ground, bleeding from several fatal wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4420;And so it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4421;A messenger arrrived outside the gates today, carrying a message informing me that the body of [From.GetBestName] has been found on the road. Based on the injuries on the body and the fact that it was stripped clean of all valuables, I suspect it to be the work of bandits, even if I might never know for sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4421;[From.GetSheHeCap] will be missed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4422;[From.GetBestName] returned home quite shaken today, claiming that that there were bandits behind [From.GetHerHim]. Though it is possible that there might be bandits nearby, I rather doubt that there is close to as many as [From.GetSheHe] claims, and as far as I am concerned [From.GetSheHe] should have fought any [From.GetSheHe] encountered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4422;How cowardly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4423;One evening when I am having a drink in a local tavern one of the locals bumps into me and causes me to spill my drink all over myself. I turn around and demand an apology, but the man just laughs and claims that I spilled my drink on my own, seeing as I am a "foreign savage".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4423;Now you've done it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4424;At first, it is just me and the man that bumped into me that are fighting, but the fighting soon spreads throughout the tavern, drawing in more and more of the locals. Eventually, the local town watch has to intervene, dragging everyone outside. Given that the man that bumped into me is unconscious and I am not, things went quite well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4424;Worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4425;At first, it is just me and the man that bumped into me that are fighting, but the fighting soon spreads throughout the tavern, drawing in more and more of the locals. Eventually, the local town watch has to intervene, dragging everyone outside. Eventually, the local town watch has to intervene, dragging everyone outside. I, the man that bumped into me, and several others have taken some injuries in the fighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4425;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4426;At first, it is just me and the man that bumped into me that are fighting, but the fighting soon spreads throughout the tavern, drawing in more and more of the locals. Eventually, the local town watch has to intervene, dragging everyone outside. By that point, I have been injured for life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4426;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4427;A messenger has arrived from the owner of a local tavern. The man is apparently quite upset with [From.GetBestName], as [From.GetSheHe] seems to have started a brawl the other night, and now demands that something is done about [From.GetBestName], as [From.GetSheHe] apprently has brawled before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4427;Brawls happen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4427;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4427;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4428;I have long known that [foreigners_target.GetBestName] has ambitions to become known as a great warrior, but though [foreigners_target.GetSheHe] certainly has some skill I feel that there are things I could teach [foreigners_target.GetHerHim], seeing as some of the techniques familiar to me might be useful against opponents that have never encountered them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4428;Let me teach you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4429;[From.GetBestName] approached me today, suggesting that [From.GetSheHe] could teach me a few fighting moves unlike anything I am familiar with. Given that [From.GetSheHe] is a foreigner, it is quite likely that [From.GetSheHe] knows some exotic techniques, but it would perhaps be a bit embarrassing to get a lesson from [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4429;I accept your help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4429;I don't need your help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4430;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have been seen practicing swordfighting together. It seems [FromFrom.GetBestName] was the teacher, which is a bit odd, but [From.GetBestName] apparently was content with that arrangement, and [From.GetSheHe] might have learned some foreign tricks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4430;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4431;One day when I am visiting a local market some of the locals ask me how I like it in the area. I tell them that I rather like it but that there are some things I rather miss from my home. This does not seem to be what they wanted to hear, as they get quite angry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4431;Maybe I misspoke...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4432;I have just received word that the peasants in [foreigners_target_province.GetName] have gotten restless as a result of [From.GetBestName]'s latest visit. Apparently, [From.GetBestName] said that [From.GetSheHe] wished for dishonor on the peasants, their whole families, and their cows, as well as several other insulting things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4432;Ignore the peasant rabble!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4432;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4432;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4433;[From.GetBestName] has always implied that [From.GetSheHe] possesses quite a bit of useful knowledge from back where [From.GetSheHe] originally came from, even if [From.GetSheHe] rarely has shown this to be true. However, today [From.GetSheHe] proved [From.GetHerHis] knowledge by offering several useful suggestions during a meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4433;That was helpful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4434;One day when I am in the company of [foreigners_target.GetBestName] I realize that there are things that I know that [foreigners_target.GetSheHe] does not. Perhaps it would be wise to share those insights, seeing as I am a guest in this foreign land?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4434;Let me teach you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4435;One day when I am in the company of [From.GetBestName] [From.GetSheHe] suggests that perhaps [From.GetSheHe] could be permitted to share some insights regarding some matters that [From.GetSheHe] picked up some useful knowledge about back home. Perhaps it would be embarrassing to accept, but it might also be useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4435;I accept your help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4435;I don't need your help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4436;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] apparently has been taught some things by [FromFrom.GetBestName] as [From.GetSheHe] apparently did not know as much as the foreigner. I am sure that there are those that would consider the need for such a lesson embarrassing, but maybe such knowledge is worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4436;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4437;My experiences while staying at the court of [foreigners_host.GetBestName] have been many, and some of them have taught me quite a few things. I have been composing a book about some of those things for a while, and today I finished the final draft to present to [foreigners_host.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4437;I dedicate this to you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4438;[From.GetBestName] sought an audience today, which you decide to grant. To my surprise, [From.GetSheHe] presented a book to me, which [From.GetSheHe] apparently has been working on for some time. Skimming through it rather quickly, I easily conclude that [From.GetBestName]'s talents lie elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4438;I accept your gift!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4438;You can keep it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4439;[From.GetBestName] sought an audience today, which you decide to grant. To my surprise, [From.GetSheHe] presented a book to me, which [From.GetSheHe] apparently has been working on for some time. Skimming through it rather quickly, I easily conclude that [From.GetBestName] is a decently talented author.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_4440;[From.GetBestName] sought an audience today, which you decide to grant. To my surprise, [From.GetSheHe] presented a book to me, which [From.GetSheHe] apparently has been working on for some time. Skimming through it rather quickly, I easily conclude that [From.GetBestName] definitely knows quite a lot about writing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4440;I accept your gift!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4440;You can keep it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4441;[foreigners_target.GetBestName] has long expressed an interest in the ways of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith and just what [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] expects of the faithful. I have done my best to answer the questions I have been asked, and it seems to have paid off, seeing as [foreigners_target.GetSheHe] has seen fit to convert.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4441;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4442;Today I learned that [foreigners_target.GetBestName] has seen fit to convert to the [From.Religion.GetName] due to the actions of [From.GetBestName]. This conversion certainly is not to the liking of everyone, and it is up to me to decide how to handle the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4442;[From.GetSheHeCap] did the right thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4442;I will ignore it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4442;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4442;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4443;It seems the inhabitants of [foreigners_target_province.GetName] have taken an interest in [From.GetBestName] and [From.GetHerHis] ways, as the majority has seen fit to convert to the [From.Religion.GetName] faith. Some people at my court are outraged by this, and I have to decide how to handle the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4443;[From.GetSheHeCap] did the right thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4443;I will ignore it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_SOH_4443;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4444;As I am a foreigner at the court of [foreigners_host.GetBestName] there are many that consider me utterly irrelevant and that perhaps underestimate me. As a result, people are sometimes careless around me, and that has allowed me to notice that some people, such as [foreigners_target.GetBestName], are up to unsavory things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4444;I saw that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4445;It seems [From.GetBestName], the shipwrecked foreigner who has been living at [foreigners_host.GetBestName]'s court for some time, is paying more attention to what goes on than you would have expected, as [From.GetSheHe] apparently has noticed my plot and has seen fit to tell [foreigners_host.GetBestName] all about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4445;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4446;[FromFrom.GetBestName] sought an audience with me today, wishing to speak to me about [From.GetBestName]. Once the two of us were in private, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] shared some information [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has managed to uncover concerning a plot that [From.GetBestName] is involved in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4446;Good to know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4447;Many of the courtiers at [foreigners_host.GetBestName]'s court are quite wealthy, and some of them are a bit careless when it comes to ensuring that it is impossible to get into their quarters, including [foreigners_target.GetBestName]. Anyone could break in and take what is there...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4447;I will take what I can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4448;It is a simple enough matter to enter into [foreigners_target.GetBestName]'s quarters, and once inside it does not take me long to locate some valuables. While it was tempting to take some of the more unique items I found inside, I realized that it would be harder to prove anything if I only took money, and I decided that it was unwise to risk anything else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4448;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4449;It is a simple enough matter to enter into [foreigners_target.GetBestName]'s quarters, and once inside it does not take me long to locate some valuables. However, before I can take them [foreigners_target.GetBestName] returns, catching me inside [foreigners_target.GetHerHis] room and demanding that I leave at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4449;I must have gotten lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4450;[foreigners_target.GetBestName] has publicly accused [From.GetBestName] of breaking into [foreigners_target.GetHerHis] quarters, supposedly for no good reason. [From.GetBestName] has come up with several excuses for having been there, but they all are a bit contradictory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4450;It was probably a misunderstanding...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4450;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4450;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4451;Many of the vassals visiting [foreigners_host.GetBestName]'s court are quite wealthy, and some of them are a bit careless when it comes to ensuring that it is impossible to get into their quarters, including [foreigners_target.GetBestName]. Anyone could break in and take what is there...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4451;I will take what I can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4452;It is a simple enough matter to enter into [foreigners_target.GetBestName]'s quarters, and once inside it does not take me long to locate some valuables. While it was tempting to take some of the more unique items I found inside, I realized that it would be harder to prove anything if I only took money, and I decided that it was unwise to risk anything else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4452;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4453;As I return to your quarters I realize that someone has been inside and that some of the money I had left there is missing. Asking around, nobody seems to have seen anyone nearby, and I resign yourself to the fact that the thief probably never will be caught.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4453;Who could have done this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4454;It is a simple enough matter to enter into [foreigners_target.GetBestName]'s quarters, and once inside it does not take me long to locate some valuables. However, before I can depart [foreigners_target.GetBestName]'s guards return, catching me inside [foreigners_target.GetHerHis] quarters and easily subduing and imprisoning me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4454;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4455;As I return to my quarters I send in my guards ahead of me to look for any possible threats lurking inside. To my surprise, they soon drag out [From.GetBestName], who apparently was in the process of stealing some of the valuables inside. As it is clear that [From.GetSheHe] had no reason to be there, I order [From.GetHerHim] thrown in a cell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4455;You deserve no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4456;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] has imprisoned [FromFrom.GetBestName] after catching [FromFrom.GetHerHim] in the middle of an attempt to steal some valuables from inside [From.GetHerHis] personal quarters. I can see no real reason to interfere in the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4456;Thieves must be punished...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4457;There are many attractive people at the court of [foreigners_host.GetBestName], but of late my attention has primarily turned to [foreigners_target.GetBestName]. [foreigners_target.GetSheHeCap] certainly is an intriguing [foreigners_target.GetManWoman], and it might be interesting to get to know [foreigners_target.GetHerHim] more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4457;I will make an attempt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4457;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4458;Today I was approached by [From.GetBestName], the shipwrecked foreigner who has been living at the court of [foreigners_host.GetBestName] for some time. [From.GetSheHeCap] made it quite clear that [From.GetSheHe] wishes to get to know me more intimately, and that [From.GetSheHe] knows of a secluded place nearby...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4458;I like the way you think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4458;You and me? Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4459;[From.GetBestName] was not as receptive to the suggestion that the two of us should leave for some place more private so that we could get to know each other intimately as I would have hoped, and has made it clear that [From.GetSheHe] does not wish for me to bring up the matter again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4459;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4460;[From.GetBestName] was as receptive to my suggestion that the two of us should leave for some place more private so that we could get to know each other intimately as I had hoped, and it was not terribly difficult to find such a place. Some time later, as we are getting dressed, the matter of the future is brought up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4460;We should do this again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4460;It won't happen again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4461;There are many attractive people in the realm of [foreigners_host.GetBestName], but of late my attention has primarily turned to [foreigners_target.GetBestName].

EVTDESC_SOH_4463;[From.GetBestName] was not as receptive to my suggestion that the two of us should leave for some place more private so that we could get to know each other intimately as I would have hoped, and has made it clear that [From.GetSheHe] does not wish for me to ever bring up the matter again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SOH_4464;It won't happen again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4465;I and [From.GetBestName] share a rather enjoyable time together away from the eyes of all others. When we are getting dressed again we discuss the matter of what happens next, and [From.GetSheHe] suggests that we should meet again as soon as it can be arranged, seeing as we both had a good time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4465;I look forward to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4466;I and [From.GetBestName] share a rather enjoyable time together away from the eyes of all others. When we are getting dressed again we discuss the matter of what happens next, and [From.GetSheHe] suggests that we should not make a habit out of it, seeing as it sooner or later would attract attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4466;Maybe for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4467;The foreigner, [From.GetBestName], has been visiting [foreigners_target_province.GetName] frequently over the past month, making some small investments and suggesting how the locals can improve things in various areas. It is already starting to yield some promising results, as best I can tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4467;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4468;One day when I am in the company of [foreigners_target.GetBestName] I forget just what the proper etiquette for that situation would be and make a mess of the situation. I try to smooth things over, but it becomes clear that it will take time before my careless words are forgiven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4468;That could have gone better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4469;I spent some time with [From.GetBestName], the shipwrecked foreigner living at [foreigners_host.GetBestName]'s court, today, and though [From.GetSheHe] usually knows what not to do [From.GetSheHe] was rather careless as [From.GetSheHe] spoke today, and some things [From.GetSheHe] said were quite insulting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4469;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4470;It seems [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been causing trouble recently, seeing as [From.GetBestName] has been heard complaining about [FromFrom.GetHerHim] insulting [From.GetHerHim]. Normally, this would not concern me, but as [FromFrom.GetBestName] is a shipwrecked foreigner living at my court [FromFrom.GetHerHis] actions reflect poorly on me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4470;It was probably a misunderstanding...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_4475;Though it never seemed particularly likely to me that [From.GetBestName] would be as useful to me as someone not from a foreign land [From.GetSheHe] has proven to be even less useful than I expected. It is quite embarrassing, really, to have seen fit to keep [From.GetHerHim] around in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4475;Not everything goes as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4476;Unlike most people, I am meant for great things, or so the voices only I can hear tell me. Now [foreigners_target.GetBestName] has become a threat to my destiny, and [foreigners_target.GetSheHe] needs to be removed without delay, or so the voices tell me at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4476;As the voices command!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4477;One evening as I am about to fall asleep I hear movement inside my quarters. Turning towards the sound, I discover [From.GetBestName] standing over me, a dagger at the ready. [From.GetSheHeCap] moves to attack me before I can react, and by the time the guards arrive it is much too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4477;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4478;I have received word that [From.GetBestName] was murdered in [From.GetHerHis] bed by none other than [FromFrom.GetBestName], who was caught at the scene. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] does not deny it, and instead merely claims that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] did what the voices told [FromFrom.GetHerHim] to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_4479;I barely survived...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4480;I have received word that [From.GetBestName] almost was murdered in [From.GetHerHis] bed by none other than [FromFrom.GetBestName], who was caught at the scene. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] does not deny it, and instead merely claims that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] did what the voices told [FromFrom.GetHerHim] to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_4481;The voices are restless today. They tell me that it is a time for change. At first, I have trouble realizing what they mean, but then I realize that it is time for me to become a [foreigners_target_province.Culture.GetName] [foreigners_target_province.Religion.GetName], as that is what the voices desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4481;New day, new me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4482;I have long suspected that [From.GetBestName] is not quite right in the head, and this suspicion only grew stronger after I met [From.GetHerHim] today. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] has decided that [From.GetSheHe] now will adhere to the customs of the [From.Culture.GetName] and the teachings of the [From.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4482;How does that make sense?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4483;[From.GetBestName] has been at me court for quite some time now, and has shown an interest in local customs and beliefs almost since [From.GetSheHe] arrived.

##### Moon Princess
EVTDESC_JAPAN_511;Word has arrived that a strange woman has arrived nearby recently. The rumours you have had are quite contradictory, but they all seem to agree that she has highly unusual hair, and most of the rumours claim that she might be from the Moon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_511;I will check this out myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_511;This can't be important...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_512;You have arrived in the area where the woman with the strange hair supposedly can be found, and you have no difficulty locating her. Her hair truly is unusual, seeing as it is pink of all things. Introducing herself as Kaguya, the woman claims that she is in the area because she has received a message that some people might need help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_512;Let me know if I can be of assistance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_512;I don't have time for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_513;Some time after you visited her you receive a message from the pink-haired woman known as Kaguya. She informs you that she has been able to determine that the people she was there to assist can be found elsewhere, and as such she will be departing from the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_513;Safe voyage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_514;Some time after you visited her you receive a message from the pink-haired woman known as Kaguya. She claims that she will need access to various rare materials in order to be able to help the people that requested her assistance, and she is wondering whether you might be able to provide those materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_514;I can provide the money, at least!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_514;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_515;You have received another message from Kaguya, the strange pink-haired woman you met before. She regrets to inform you that she was unable to find the supplies she needed in the area and will be looking for them elsewhere. The messenger that delivered the message claims that the woman that gave it to him flew off in a strange iron contraption.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_515;What?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_516;Kaguya, the strange pink-haired woman you met before, requests that you come visit her. When you arrive she hands you a large book, telling you that it is payment for services rendered. The book turns out to contain highly advanced knowledge, some of which might explain the strange iron contraption you saw flying off as you were departing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

##### Scandalous Saio/Saiin
EVTDESC_JAPAN_518;As an Imperial Priestess, you are expected to remain a virgin until such a time that you are replaced.
