EVTDESC_SOH_8403;Due to a combination of a lack of ocean currents and a lack of wind, the Treasure Fleet has found itself becalmed. Without doubt, the situation will improve sooner or later, but for the time being it will not be making much progress towards the next port.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8403;Unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8405;Over the last couple of days the weather has been getting steadily worse as a storm has been brewing nearby. Though an attempt has been made to avoid it, the Treasure Fleet has been unable to do so, and now it will have no choice but to face the storm's fury. Hopefully the ships are sturdy enough to withstand what is to come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8405;Grab on to something!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8407;Though the passage through the storm hardly can be considered pleasant it is by no means as dangerous as it could have been. A census conducted after the storm disperses makes it clear that no lives have been lost, and no ship seems to have suffered any noteworthy damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8407;That wasn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8408;The passage through the storm is rather unpleasant, but the fleet emerges with only minor damage done to the ships. A few particularly unlucky sailors have been injured, but no lives seem to have been lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8408;That could have gone a lot worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8409;The Treasure Fleet does not emerge entirely unscatched from the storm. Though the ship I am on escapes without major damage, several other ships go down, with the crews and passengers aboard trying to swim towards the surviving vessels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8409;We should save all we can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8410;The voyage through the storm is not too bad at first, but it gets worse over time, and eventually my ship's luck runs out. Lightning strikes the masts, and fierce waves batter the hull. The sailors do all they can to save the ship, but their efforts are in vain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8410;I must swim to safety!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8411;Despite the best efforts of the sailors aboard the Treasure Fleet, the voyage through the storm proves to be the fleet's undoing. Lightning and waves batter the ships, with ship after ship going under. My ship goes under before the storm dissipates, and though I try my best I cannot make it ashore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8411;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8412;I have just received word that the Treasure Fleet has gone down with all hands. It was seen heading directly into a fierce storm, and once the weather cleared only driftwood and corpses remained to be discovered by the nearby ships that had managed to avoid the worst of the storm's fury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8412;Most inauspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8413;I have just received word that the Treasure Fleet has gone down with all hands.

EVTDESC_SOH_8414;I have just received word that the Treasure Fleet has gone down with all hands. It was seen heading directly into a fierce storm, and once the weather cleared only driftwood and corpses remained to be discovered by the nearby ships that had managed to avoid the worst of the storm's fury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8414;So much for that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8414;How auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8416;The Treasure Fleet carries with it many of the wonders of the Middle Kingdom, including fireworks. Despite orders to avoid bringing fire near them it seems that not everyone has been careful enough. One day, shouts of panic can be heard from one of the ships before a large number of fireworks go off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8416;Take cover!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8418;Though the ship that the fireworks go off on at first seems to be in enough trouble that many think that it might be lost with all hands the sailors aboard the ship manage to get the situation under control. There are plenty of scorch marks, but no noteworthy damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8418;That wasn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8419;The fireworks that go off aboard one of the ships kill or injure some of the sailors before the situation is brought under control. In the end, there is some minor damage to the ship in question, but it is intact enough that it does not have to be scuttled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8419;That could have gone a lot worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8420;The ship aboard which the fireworks went off is lost with all hands, and several other ships also suffer damage due to being struck by errant fireworks. A few of them even go down, though seemingly not with all hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8420;We should save all we can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8421;My ship turns out to be too close to the ship aboard which the fireworks first went off, and an errant firework strikes it in such a fashion that our fireworks also are set off. The sailors try to deal with the situation, but it soon becomes clear that the ship is going under.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8421;I must swim to safety!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8422;Ship after ship is struck by fireworks, and the resulting flames set more and more fireworks ablaze. The sailors aboard my ship do their best to steer it away from the conflagration and to smother any fires aboard, but their efforts are in vain. The ship is soon ablaze, and I can tell I will not be able to jump overboard in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8422;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8423;Word has reached me that the Treasure Fleet has been lost with all hands. Several fishermen that saw what happened have reported that something exploded aboard one of the ships and that flames soon consumed the rest of the fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8423;Most inauspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8424;Word has reached me that the Treasure Fleet has been lost with all hands. Several fishermen that saw what happened have reported that something exploded aboard one of the ships and that flames soon consumed the rest of the fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SOH_8425;How auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8427;One day the lookouts call out that there are many sails on the horizon. I can spot the ships easily enough now that I am aware of their presence, and it soon becomes clear that they mean to intercept the Treasure Fleet. It seems unlikely that their intentions are friendly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8427;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8427;I should find somewhere to hide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8429;Sure enough, the approaching fleet's intentions turn out to be unfriendly. However, the Treasure Fleet is hardly unprepared by the time that the other ships arrive, and the pirates aboard are driven back with ease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8429;That wasn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8430;Sure enough, the approaching fleet's intentions turn out to be unfriendly. The pirates aboard fight fiercely, but though many sailors lose their lives driving them off there is little permanent damage done to the Treasure Fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8430;That could have gone a lot worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8431;The approaching fleet turns out to consist of pirates, and they board several of the Treasure Fleet's ships easily enough. Eventually, they are driven back, but several ships have been lost, and many have been forced to jump overboard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8431;We should save all we can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8432;The approaching fleet turns out to consist of pirates, and though those aboard my ship fight bravely we are unable to drive them off. The ship suffers enough damage that it starts to go under, and I am forced to jump overboard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8432;I must swim to safety!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8433;The pirates attacking the Treasure Fleet turn out to be too many. The brave defenders put up a good fight, but are soon killed or disarmed. Those that surrender soon find that the pirates are not interested in mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8433;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8434;Word has reached me that the Treasure Fleet has been lost with all hands. One of my agents who has been monitoring a large group of pirates for me has reported that the pirates in question attacked the Treasure Fleet not long ago, and though they took some losses they still managed to destroy the fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8434;Most inauspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8435;Word has reached me that the Treasure Fleet has been lost with all hands.

EVTOPTB_SOH_8436;How auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8438;Over the past few weeks, many of the sailors aboard the Treasure Fleet have been growing more and more discontent, as have many of the soldiers. The officers have tried to manage the situation, but it seems that they have been unsuccessful. Ship by ship, a full mutiny has broken out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8438;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8438;I should find somewhere to hide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8440;Though the mutineers strike together they are not strong enough to prevail. Lives are lost on both sides, but the mutineers are forced to surrender in the end, and the Treasure Fleet comes through relatively unscatched.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8440;That wasn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8441;The mutineers fight bravely, but though they cause some damage they are crushed with a relatively small loss of life. The Treasure Fleet is weaker, to be sure, but it will continue on its voyage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8441;That could have gone a lot worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8442;The mutineers are not strong enough to win in the end, but once it becomes clear to them that they are losing some of them attempt to inflict as much damage as possible, scuttling several ships. The loyalists aboard are forced to swim to safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8442;We should save all we can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8443;The mutineers are not strong enough to win in the end, but once they realize that they cannot win those aboard my ship decide to scuttle it. The loyalists are unable to stop them before the ship is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8443;I must swim to safety!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8444;The mutineers have the numbers to prevail, despite the efforts of those that seek to hold them off. Ship after ship is either scuttled or secured by the mutineers, and before long they are upon me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8444;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8445;I have received disturbing reports from several fishing boats in the area where the Treasure Fleet was recently seen, claiming that the Treasure Fleet started fighting itself one day and that the ships that survived the battle have hoisted an unfamiliar flag. Their loyalties are unlikely to lie with the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_8447;So much for that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8447;How auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8448;The remnants of the Treasure Fleet have arrived off the coast of [invasion_province.GetName], and a large army has disembarked. It seems the mutineers wish to carve out a realm of their own in my lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8448;Throw them back into the sea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8450;At first, the Treasure Fleet's voyage towards its next port was rather uneventful. That changes rapidly one day, however, as a gigantic octopus suddenly emerges next to one of the ships and drags it into the depths without warning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8450;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8450;I should find somewhere to hide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8452;The gigantic octopus turns out to have no interest in the rest of the Treasure Fleet, so aside from the one ship that was lost with all hands when it was attacked no damage is inflicted and no lives are lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8452;That wasn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8453;Though the gigantic octopus moves towards the rest of the Treasure Fleet and attempts to wrap its tentacles around one of the ships it is driven off before long. It does some minor damage to the ship in question, and some sailors lose their lives, but overall the Treasure Fleet emerges unscatched.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8453;That could have gone a lot worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8454;Several more ships are dragged beneath the waves before the gigantic octopus is convinced to leave the fleet alone. Some of those that were aboard those ships survived, and are now swimming towards my ship and the others that have survived the battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8454;We should save all we can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8455;My ship sustains significant damage from the battle with the gigantic octopus, and it is clearly sinking. The creature has been driven off, but I might yet lose my life as a result of its attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8455;I must swim to safety!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8456;Though the brave defenders aboard the Treasure Fleet fight fiercely they are no match for the gigantic octopus. Ship after ship is lost, and one by one those of us that survive long enough to start swimming towards the shore are dragged beneath the surface, with none to be seen again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8456;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8457;Word has reached me that the Treasure Fleet has gone down with all hands. Some fishermen that were close enough to see its end claim that an enormous octopus rose from the depths and attacked the fleet, smashing the ships to pieces and either killing those aboard or leaving them to drown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8457;Most inauspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
