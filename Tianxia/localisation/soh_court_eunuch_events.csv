EVTDESC_SOH_5305;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has several imperial guard regiments at [From.GetHerHis] direct command. However, considering the influence I and the other Council Eunuchs possess, it might be possible to change things in our favor...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5305;The [guard_regiment_commander.PrimaryTitle.GetName] should be under eunuch supervision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5305;We have no need of guard regiments!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5306;It seems [From.GetBestName] believes that an imperial guard regiment would benefit from being under direct eunuch supervision, and that he has considerable support for this idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5306;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5306;I wish I could oppose this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5306;I can't get involved...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5308;The eunuchs wield considerable influence at my court, and this has at times made them troublesome to deal with. However, at the moment they seem quite pleased with the influence they wield, and with me as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5308;For once they are pleased...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5309;Seeing as they wield a non-negligible amount of influence at my court, the eunuchs are looked up to in a way by some people, even though the primary job requirement makes it somewhat unlikely that others aspire to take their place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5309;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5310;A minor eunuch at court by the name of [skilled_eunuch.GetBestName] has apparently been impressing other, more influential eunuchs, with his skills. They are now suggesting that he should be given a spot on my council, for the good of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5310;An excellent idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5310;I have no need of him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5312;[From.GetBestName], my liege, has a fairly large treasury. As a Council Eunuch, I have the authority to ensure that some of [From.GetHerHis] wealth is diverted where it would make the most good... such as in my pockets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5312;It's my money now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5312;I don't need it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5313;It seems [From.GetBestName] has used his considerable influence to divert a significant amount of funds from my treasury, supposedly framing it as a move that would be beneficial to the realm as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5313;If only he had less influence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5315;[From.GetBestName], my liege, does not wield as much influence as would be expected of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven. As such, [From.GetSheHe] does perhaps not deserve my respect, or the respect of others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5315;The [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven does not deserve respect!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5315;Actually, I think [From.GetSheHe] does...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5316;It seems [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to use his considerable influence to discredit me and my rule. Unfortunately, the way he approached the matter makes it impossible for me to punish him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5316;Curse him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5317;The influence the eunuchs wield at my court is quite considerable. This reflects poorly on me, and has also made many other influential people quite upset with my inability to keep the eunuchs under control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5317;Not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5318;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, is unable to keep the eunuchs at [From.GetHerHis] court under control. This is very improper, and very inauspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5318;Someone should do something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5320;[quarreling_eunuch.GetBestName], one of the more influential eunuchs at [From.GetBestName]'s court, has never been a friend of mine, and of late he has been going out of his way to antagonize me. His recent actions have been unforgiveable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5320;You have made an enemy for life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5321;It seems [quarreling_eunuch.GetBestName] has been getting on [From.GetBestName]'s nerves quite a bit recently, seeing as [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to declare that [quarreling_eunuch.GetBestName] is [From.GetHerHis] enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5321;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5323;[quarreling_eunuch.GetBestName] and the other eunuchs have been flaunting their extensive influence rather blatantly recently. As a result, my other councillors seem to have started to dislike the eunuchs quite a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5323;Perhaps this helps me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5324;[quarreling_eunuch.GetBestName] and his fellow eunuchs have been acting quite rudely of late, flaunting their influence in a most blatant manner. I cannot stand the sight of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5324;They should know their place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5326;[From.GetBestName], my liege, is a good friend of mine. Seeing as I have some influence at court, I could perhaps help [From.GetHerHim] out by giving [From.GetHerHim] a Favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5326;[From.GetSheHeCap] deserves a Favor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5326;Actually, I think not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5327;It seems [From.GetBestName] truly values our friendship, seeing as he has informed me that he feels he owes me a Favor. Considering that he has quite a bit of influence at court, this might be useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5327;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5329;[target_child.GetBestName], [From.GetBestName]'s [target_child.GetSonDaughter], is a rather courteous child. [target_child.GetSheHeCap] always treats me with respect, and [From.GetSheHe] might perhaps even make a good [target_child.GetSonDaughterCap] in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5329;I rather like [target_child.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5329;It matters not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5330;It seems [From.GetBestName] has taken a liking to [target_child.GetBestName], my [target_child.GetSonDaughter]. In fact, the feeling seems mutual, and I suspect that they might consider each other friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5330;That could be good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5332;[target_child.GetBestName], [From.GetBestName]'s [target_child.GetSonDaughter], is a very rude child. [target_child.GetSheHeCap] never treats me with respect, and [From.GetSheHe] would probably not make a good [target_child.GetSonDaughterCap].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5332;I hate that [target_child.GetBoyGirl]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5332;I can forgive [target_child.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5333;It seems [From.GetBestName] has grown to dislike [target_child.GetBestName], my [target_child.GetSonDaughter]. In fact, the feeling seems mutual, and I suspect that they might consider each other enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5333;That could be bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5336;Seeing as I and the other eunuchs at [From.GetBestName]'s court are quite influential, it feels only right for us to have some control over [From.GetHerHis] forces. Maybe I should pull some strings to ensure that I am placed in command, rather than [commander_to_replace.GetBestName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5336;I should be in command!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5336;I don't really want that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5337;I have just learned that the eunuchs seeks to have [commander_to_replace.GetBestName] relieved of command so that [From.GetBestName] can be put in command instead. This may or may not be something that would benefit my forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5337;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5337;Very well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5338;I have just been informed that I have been relieved of my position as commander of [From.GetBestName]'s armies as [FromFrom.GetBestName] has convinced my liege that he is a much better choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5338;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
