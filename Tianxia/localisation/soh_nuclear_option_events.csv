EVTDESC_SOH_5102;The eunuchs at court are very influential at present, and many attempts to limit their influence have failed. Perhaps I should call in [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] to deal with the matter in a very direct fashion, even though [vassal_assisting.GetSheHe] might expect significant influence in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5102;I will call [vassal_assisting.GetHerHim] in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5102;I will call [vassal_assisting.GetHerHim] in... and betray [vassal_assisting.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5102;It would be too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5103;There are quite a few very influential courtiers at present, and many attempts to limit their influence have failed. Perhaps I should call in [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] to deal with the matter in a very direct fashion, even though [vassal_assisting.GetSheHe] might expect significant influence in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5103;I will call [vassal_assisting.GetHerHim] in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_SOH_5103;It would be too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5104;The eunuchs and several others at court are very influential at present, and many attempts to limit their influence have failed. Perhaps I should call in [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] to deal with the matter in a very direct fashion, even though [vassal_assisting.GetSheHe] might expect significant influence in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5104;I will call [vassal_assisting.GetHerHim] in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5104;I will call [vassal_assisting.GetHerHim] in... and betray [vassal_assisting.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5104;It would be too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5105;The current situation at court needs to change. At present, I believe [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] would be best suited for dealing with the matter, even though [vassal_assisting.GetSheHe] might expect significant influence in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5105;I will call [vassal_assisting.GetHerHim] in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_SOH_5105;It would be too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5106;A messenger has arrived in the dead of night, bringing a secret missive from [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven. Apparently the situation at court is such that [From.GetSheHe] wishes for me to gather an army to deal with a number of people that are far too powerful for [From.GetBestName]'s liking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5106;[From.GetBestName] will certainly reward me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5106;This sounds far too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5107;[From.GetBestName] has sent out a secret call to arms, requesting that I should gather my most trusted retainers to join [From.GetHerHim] in [From.GetHerHis] attempt to help [From.Liege.GetBestName], the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, deal with some troublesome members of [From.Liege.GetHerHis] court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5107;Of course I will help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5107;This is far too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5108;I have received word that [From.GetBestName] will be joining me in my attempt to help the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven deal with the situation at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5108;Together we are sure to triumph!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5109;I have received word that [From.GetBestName] has no intention of joining me in my attempt to help the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven deal with the situation at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5109;I don't need [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5110;The messenger I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned, bringing word that [From.GetSheHe] is gathering [From.GetHerHis] most trusted soldiers in secret to bring them to my court to help me with the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5110;Now I just need to wait...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5111;The messenger I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that [From.GetSheHe] is not prepared to help me with the situation at court. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] thinks it is far too risky to make such a move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5111;With subjects like these, who needs enemies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5112;The situation at the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's court is dire. The eunuchs have amassed a great deal of power, and they are using it in an unseemely fashion. It is clear they must be dealt with... permanently. Perhaps I could be the one that sees it done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5112;I will gather my forces at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5112;It would be far too dangerous...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5113;The [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's court is currently dominated by a number of powerful courtiers, and it is clear that they are abusing their authority. The realm would benefit from someone marching to the capital and dealing with these courtiers... permanently. Maybe I should take the initiative to see it done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5113;I will gather my forces at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5113;It would be far too dangerous...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5114;A number of powerful courtiers and eunuchs currently control the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's court, which is a state of affairs that clearly will not benefit the realm in the long term. Someone should lead an army to the capital and deal with these uppity courtiers and eunuchs... permanently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5114;I will gather my forces at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5114;It would be far too dangerous...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5115;I have made the decision to gather my most loyal retainers to march to the capital of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven to deal with the situation at court. I expect to be duly compensated, of course, but everyone should see that I am doing this for the good of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5115;I am doing the realm a service!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5116;My liege, [From.GetBestName], has sent a message asking for me to gather my most trusted retainers to join [From.GetHerHim] in [From.GetHerHis] attempt to deal with certain troublesome elements at the court of the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5116;I will see to it at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5116;I will not take part in this fool's errand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5117;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] will be joining me in my attempt to deal with the situation at the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's court, along with [From.GetHerHis] most trusted retainers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5117;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5118;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] considers my attempt to deal with the situation at the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's court a fool's errand, and that [From.GetSheHe] will not be throwing away [From.GetHerHis] life in such a manner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5118;I expected better from [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5119;A messenger arrived in the dead of night, and somehow made contact with some of my most trusted guards to pass on a missive from [From.GetBestName], informing me that [From.GetSheHe] is coming to the capital with an army to deal with certain troublesome elements at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5119;[From.GetBestName] has my support!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5119;I will play them against each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5119;I will oppose [From.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_5119;I can't get involved...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5121;I have arrived at the capital of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven with my most trusted retainers. Unfortunately, [Root.Liege.GetBestName] does not seem to understand that I am doing this for the good of the realm, seeing as [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] forces clearly are arrayed against me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5121;Someone else also needs to be dealt with...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5122;[From.GetBestName]'s forces have arrived at my capital, and my forces are ready to oppose them, alongside the forces loyal to certain interest groups at court. If [From.GetBestName] should prevail, I doubt [From.GetSheHe] will be happy about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5122;It is for the good of the realm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5123;It seems the troublesome elements at court have learned of my arrival at the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's court ahead of time, as their forces are arrayed against mine. It seems [Root.Liege.GetBestName]'s forces are not with them, however, which bodes well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5123;I can still win this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5124;[From.GetBestName]'s forces have arrived at my capital, ready to deal with certain troublesome elements at my court. It seems [From.GetHerHis] arrival was expected, however, as forces loyal to those same elements at court are arrayed against [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5124;I must help [From.GetHerHim] prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5124;Now we wait for the moment to strike...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5125;I have arrived at the capital of [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven with my forces, and it would seem my arrival has not been anticipated as there is only a token detachment of guards at the gates. They wisely throw down their weapons and step aside when they realize how outnumbered they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5125;Secure the palace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5126;[From.GetBestName]'s forces have arrived at my, and the outnumbered guards at the gates have seemingly stepped aside as there is already sounds of fighting coming from quite a bit further into the palace. The unexpected arrival of [From.GetBestName]'s forces might bode well for [From.GetHerHis] chances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5126;This might actually work out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5126;Now we wait for the moment to strike...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5126;This should be interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5128;The fighting in the palace continues. At the moment, the forces of [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] appear to be gaining the upper hand, though in the chaos it is hard to tell, particularly as a lot of it is taking place quite far from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5128;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5128;Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5128;This is getting out of hand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_5128;Time to spring my trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5130;The fighting inside the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven seems to be going well, and my forces seem to be prevailing on multiple fronts. Still, the fighting is chaotic, and it is impossible for me to personally oversee more than a small fraction of it, so the battle might still turn against me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5130; Keep the pressure on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5131;As the fighting continues my soldiers corner [cornered_rival.GetBestName] and a small detachment of [cornered_rival.GetHerHis] guards in a small room. The latter are swiftly dealt with, and my soldiers bring [cornered_rival.GetBestName] before me, knowing that I might wish to deal with [cornered_rival.GetHerHim] personally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5131;I will enjoy this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5131;Guards! Take [cornered_rival.GetHerHim] away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5132;In the middle of the fighting I come across [traitor_courtier.GetBestName] and a small detachment of guards holding [betrayed_courtier.GetBestName] captive. [traitor_courtier.GetBestName] offers to hand [betrayed_courtier.GetBestName] over to me, in exchange for me sparing [traitor_courtier.GetHerHim] if I prevail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5132;Very well. You will be spared!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5132;Guards! Seize them both!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5133;One of my soldiers comes running to inform me that a room containing what appears to be a large amount of tax money yet to be counted has been discovered. Much as I might wish otherwise, it would likely disappear into the hands of some less honest soldiers if I left it alone, so I know what must be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5133;Secure it, for the good of the realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5134;One of my soldiers approaches me and presents a small box containing a valuable item discovered during the fighting. Its owner will probably not like losing it, but I doubt they can be found, and the item certainly is far too valuable to just leave lying around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5134;I can find a use for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5135;The fighting at the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's palace is going well, and it seems [Root.Liege.GetBestName]'s commanders are realizingt this. One of them, [traitor_courtier.GetBestName], has requested a truce to negotiate [traitor_courtier.GetHerHis] defection to my side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5135;I welcome your fealty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5135;Guards! Imprison this traitor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5136;One of my messengers informs me that [traitor_courtier.GetBestName] has seen fit to betray my forces to align with [From.GetBestName]. Apparently [traitor_courtier.GetSheHe] must have failed to understand that my forces' current weakness merely is a temporary setback.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5136;It's treason, then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5137;One of my soldiers comes running to inform me that the location of my hated rival, [discovered_prisoner.GetBestName], has been determined and that [discovered_prisoner.GetSheHe] is only lightly guarded. It would be a simple matter to take a quick detour to see to it that [discovered_prisoner.GetSheHe] dies, if I so desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5137;Time for [discovered_prisoner.GetHerHim] to die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5137;[discovered_prisoner.GetSheHeCap] is where [discovered_prisoner.GetSheHe] belongs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5138;The sounds of fighting in the palace have been getting closer for quite some time and the guards outside have gone to investigate the situation. I hear the sound of footsteps approaching and expect to see the guards returning, but instead I discover that it is [From.GetBestName] that is coming my way, [From.GetHerHis] weapon at the ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5138;You? No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5139;One of my soldiers has informed me that the location of [discovered_prisoner.GetBestName] has been determined and that [discovered_prisoner.GetSheHe] only is lightly guarded at this time. It would not be difficult to rescue [discovered_prisoner.GetHerHim], if I so desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5139;I must release [discovered_prisoner.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5139;I have better things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5140;The guards that usually are nearby have disappeared to investigate the sound of fighting. They do not return, and the reason for this is obvious as soon as I discover that [From.GetBestName] has come to rescue me from captivity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5140;My thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5140;[From.GetSheHeCap] truly loves me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5141;[From.GetBestName] is clearly very happy to be rescued by me, and [From.GetSheHe] suggest that we should leave the fighting to my trusted commanders for the time being so that [From.GetSheHe] can thank me properly somewhere out of sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5141;I suppose we could find somewhere private...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5142;A messenger comes running, bringing word that [discovered_prisoner.GetBestName] apparently has escaped from captivity during the fighting in the palace. The circumstances surrounding this will probably never come to light, considering the ongoing chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5142;Did [discovered_prisoner.GetSheHe] escape on [discovered_prisoner.GetHerHis] own?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5143;I have been informed by one of my soldiers that the location of [discovered_prisoner.GetBestName] has been determined and that nearly all of [discovered_prisoner.GetHerHis] guards have been drawn away due to the ongoing fighting. It would be easy for me to free [discovered_prisoner.GetHerHim], if I so desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5143;I must release [discovered_prisoner.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5143;I need to focus on the fighting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5144;I am normally surrounded by quite a few guards loyal to the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, but they have been drawn away by the ongoing fighting. To my great surprise and pleasure, this has made it possible for [From.GetBestName] to free me from captivity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5144;My thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5145;A messenger comes running and informs me that [discovered_prisoner.GetBestName] is nowhere to be found. [discovered_prisoner.GetSheHeCap] seems to have managed to slip away in the chaos of the fighting, and just how that happened will probably never be determined.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5145;Did someone help [discovered_prisoner.GetHerHim], perhaps?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5146;Fighting side by side with [commander_friend.GetBestName] against our common foes in the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's palace has been a bonding experience. I find that I can trust [commander_friend.GetHerHim] to do whatever it takes to see this through, and I feel that I have made a friend for life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5146;Together we are unstoppable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5147;Fighting side by side with [From.GetBestName] against our common foes in the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's palace has been a bonding experience. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems determined to do whatever it takes to see this through for the good of the realm, and I feel that I have made a friend for life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5147;Together we are unstoppable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5148;With the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's forces fighting alongside mine, it is only natural that I have had to work together with some of [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] commanders. One of them, [commander_friend.GetBestName], has been quite helpful and quite courteous, and I feel that I have made a friend for life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5148;Together we are unstoppable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5149;The fighting goes on at the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's palace, and it is going quite well at present. However, I discover more and more of [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] forces amassing nearby, seemingly waiting for something. I consider the matter in the back of my head for a while before arriving at the only logical answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5149;It's a trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5150;A messenger comes running, breaking protocol and interrupting an ongoing meeting, and for a very understandable reason. Apparently [From.GetBestName] has discovered my gathering forces and has realized that I am planning to turn against [From.GetHerHim], and [From.GetSheHe] has taken the opportunity to strike first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5150;Why did I not plan for this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5151;The fighting at my palace continues. At present, the forces of various powerful individuals at my court seem to be prevailing, though it is possible things will change as the fighting continues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5151;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5151;Good! Good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5151;Not as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_5151;Time for me to enter the fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5153;Things are not going so well in the fighting at the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's palace at present, and my forces are clearly losing on several fronts while the forces of certain powerful individuals at court are gaining ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5153;This is merely a temporary setback!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5154;The fighting at the palace of the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's palace is not going well at the moment, and it might be time to consider whether removing [From.GetBestName] from the picture and arranging a surrender would be a wise course of action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5154;It's time to save my own skin...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5154;I will not betray my liege!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5156;In the middle of the fighting at [Root.Liege.GetBestName]'s palace [traitor_vassal.GetBestName] approaches me with [traitor_vassal.GetHerHis] weapon drawn.\n"We have clearly lost," [traitor_vassal.GetSheHe] says. "I think presenting your head to our foes would greatly please them.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5156;It's treason, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5157;[traitor_vassal.GetBestName] fights well, but not well enough, and I gain the upper hand as my more loyal forces keep [traitor_vassal.GetHerHis] forces from interfering. Before long, I land the killing blow on my traitorous vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5157;Thus, always, to traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5158;I fight as well as I can against [From.GetBestName], but my best is not good enough, and soldiers loyal to [From.GetBestName] keep my own soldiers from coming to my rescue. Before long, I am overcome, and [From.GetBestName] lands a fatal blow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5158;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5159;My forces keep the forces of [traitor_vassal.GetBestName] at bay as I fight [traitor_vassal.GetHerHim], but though I fight as well as I possibly can I cannot prevail. Before long, I take a fatal wound, and [From.GetBestName] moves in to finish me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5159;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5160;[From.GetBestName] puts up a good fight, but [From.GetSheHe] is no match for me, and before long I land a killing blow. Understanding just how perilous our situation is, [From.GetBestName]'s former commanders turn to me for instructions, and I quickly dispatch a messenger to our foes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5160;We surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5161;I have just received word that [traitor_vassal.GetBestName], realizing that [vassal_assisting.GetBestName]'s forces could not prevail, has seen fit to kill [traitor_vassal.GetHerHis] former liege to present [vassal_assisting.GetHerHis] head to those powerful individuals at court that [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] sought to eliminate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5161;How unexpected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5161;But that means...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5162;The small detachment of troops I am in command of in the fighting at the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's palace has been struggling for some time, and though we have tried to regroup with forces loyal to [From.GetBestName] we are cut off. My soldiers fight valiantly, but we are overcome, and our foes show no mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5162;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5163;I have just learned that a detachment of troops commanded by [From.GetBestName] has been surrounded and destroyed by forces loyal to various powerful elements at the court of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven. Not even [From.GetBestName] was spared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5163;Not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5164;Though I have done my best to stay away from the frontlines at the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's palace the highly irregular battlefield has made it possible for some of my enemies to attack from unexpected directions several times. One such surprise attack got quite close to me, and though I survived I was badly injured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5164;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5165;I am doing my best to avoid the chaotic fighting at court, moving quickly from one safe location to another. As I walk past a group of courtiers going the other way I feel a sharp pain in my side, and as I touch it my hand comes away wet with blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5165;Who...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5166;As the fighting continues at the palace of [Root.Liege.GetBestName] one of my soldiers brings me unwelcome news. It seems that not only are we losing on several fronts, but [From.GetBestName] has been found dead ine one of the hallways, bearing a wound that seems to have been inflicted with a knife or dagger rather than the weapon of a soldier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5166;Who did this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5167;The fighting at the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap]'s palace continues, and it is not going well. Even worse, [Root.Liege.GetBestName]'s forces seem to be amassing nearby, clearly waiting for something. I am quite sure I know what is going on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5167;It's a trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5168;A messenger comes running, breaking protocol and interrupting an ongoing meeting, and for a very understandable reason. Apparently [From.GetBestName] has discovered my gathering forces and has realized that I am planning to turn against [From.GetHerHim], and [From.GetSheHe] has taken the opportunity to strike first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5168;Why did I not plan for this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5169;[vassal_assisting.GetBestName] and the powerful individuals [vassal_assisting.GetSheHe] has been fighting are all too preoccupied with each other to notice my forces getting into position before I give the signal, and they are caught unawares by my initial attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5169;Fools! I will destroy you all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5170;As I continue the fight against the forces of various powerful individuals at the court of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven a messenger comes running, bringing word that the forces of [Root.Liege.GetBestName] have joined the fight, and that they seem equally inclined to destroy my forces and those of my foes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5170;It's a trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5171;The fighting at my palace is going quite well. My forces are advancing on several fronts, and the forces of [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] and those of several powerful individuals at court are falling back before them while still fighting against each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5171;None can stand against the Dragon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5173;The fighting at the palace of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven is not going well, and [Root.Liege.GetBestName]'s forces seem to be gaining the upper hand at the moment. Worse, my other foes are still fighting as hard against me as they previously did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5173;We must keep fighting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5174;The [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's forces seem to be gaining the upper hand in the fighting at [From.Liege.GetHerHis] palace. If I were to kill [From.GetBestName] and turn over [From.GetHerHis] head, I might be greatly rewarded... or I would at least increase my chances of surviving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5174;I need to save my own skin...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5174;I will not betray my liege!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5176;As my forces struggle against those of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven [From.GetBestName] readies [From.GetHerHis] weapon and heads towards me.\n"You have lost," [From.GetSheHe] says. "Presenting your head to the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven should result in a nice reward!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SOH_5176;It's treason, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5177;I engage [traitor_vassal.GetBestName] while my forces keep [traitor_vassal].GetHerHim] forces from interfering. [traitor_vassal.GetBestName] puts up a good fight, but is unable to prevail, and I manage to inflict a killing wound easily enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5177;Thus, always, to traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5178;I engage [From.GetBestName], fighting as well as I possibly can. Unfortunately, this is not nearly good enough, and though my forces attempt to come to my rescue they are unable to do so. Before long, I have taken a fatal wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5178;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5179;My forces keep [traitor_vassal.GetBestName]'s forces at bay as we fight, but even so the fight goes against me. I soon take a fatal wound, and [traitor_vassal.GetBestName] moves in to finish me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5179;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5180;[From.GetBestName] puts up a good fight, but [From.GetSheHe] is no match for me, and I land a killing blow quickly enough. Seeing the way the wind is blowing, [From.GetHerHis] forces look to me for orders, and I give the only sensible orders anyone could give in my position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5180;We surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5181;A messenger comes running, informing me that [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to kill [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] and surrender to my forces, clearly realizing that the fight had been lost. Of course, I will have to spare [From.GetBestName] now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5181;I suppose I can work with this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5182;As the fighting continues the forces of the [From.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven manage to surround me and a small number of my soldiers. Knowing that we cannot escape them, the enemy commander offers us the chance to surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5182;I will never yield to the likes of you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5182;I yield! I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5183;A messenger comes running, bearing word that [From.GetBestName] has been surrounded and killed after [From.GetSheHe] refused to surrender to my forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5183;[From.GetSheHeCap] deserved no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5184;A messenger comes running, bearing word that [From.GetBestName] and a detachment of troops under [From.GetHerHis] command have been killed by the forces of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5184;At least [From.GetSheHe] fought to the end...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5185;A messenger comes running, bearing word that [From.GetBestName] has been captured by my forces. It seems [From.GetSheHe] choose to yield rather than fighting to the bitter end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5185;I will deal with [From.GetHerHim] later!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5186;A messenger comes running, bearing word that [From.GetBestName] and a detachment of troops under [From.GetHerHis] command have been captured by the forces of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5186;[From.GetSheHeCap] should have died fighting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5187;With my forces fighting a losing battle against both the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's forces and those of my other foes at [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] court, I might be able to do better if I focus my forces on one foe for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5187;I will not let [Root.Liege.GetBestName] win!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5187;[Root.Liege.GetBestName] is more likely to show me mercy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5188;It seems [From.GetBestName] has decided to focus [From.GetHerHis] attention on my forces at present, seemingly thinking that I am a greater threat to [From.GetHerHim] than [From.GetHerHis] other foes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5188;I am not surprised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5189;It seems [From.GetBestName], while still trying to prevail against my forces, has decided to focus [From.GetHerHis] attention on our common foes at present, possibly thinking that that will let [From.GetHerHim] prevail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5189;Let them destroy each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5190;The forces loyal to the eunuchs are about to win against those of [vassal_assisting.GetBestName]. Unless I order my forces into the battle now the eunuchs will be able to reorganize their forces to thwart anything I might try later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

[to_be_dealt_with.GetSheHeCap] obviously has some connection to the troublesome elements at the court of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's court, but I can of course show mercy if I do not feel [to_be_dealt_with.GetHerHis] involvement was significant.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_SOH_5230;Victory At Court;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5230;[From.GetBestName] has won against various troublesome elements at court with my assistance, and even now [From.GetSheHe] is dealing with [From.GetHerHis] surviving enemies.\nThough I assisted [From.GetHerHim] in the fighting, it is clear [From.GetBestName] deserves a substantial reward, so in addition to greatly reducing the influence of various groups at court [From.GetSheHe] has received broad authority as Grand Chancellor, and my various vassals have been given a freer hand as well.\nHopefully, this benefits the realm more than it benefits [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5230;I guess I will find out...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5231;The [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5231;Various forces loyal to the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven took no part in the fighting against various troublesome elements at [From.GetHerHis] court despite being in position to do so, presumably due to not receiving any orders to that effect.\nIt is possible [Root.Liege.GetBestName] simply did not want to get in my way, or that [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] simply was unable to send the relevant orders in time, but it is also possible [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] was keeping them back for a less benign reason.\nPerhaps I should take certain steps, for the good of the realm...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5231;[Root.Liege.GetSheHeCap] is not my enemy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5231;[Root.Liege.GetSheHeCap] should be imprisoned!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5232;[vassal_assisting.GetTitledFirstName]'s Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5232;[From.GetBestName] has won the fight against various troublesome elements at my court, and in addition to significantly reducing the influence of those groups I have granted [From.GetHerHim] considerable authority as Grand Chancellor and have also granted several concessions to my various vassals.\nThough my forces did not take any part in the fighting, it seems [From.GetBestName] has decided not to hold this against me, even though I am sure a lesser [From.GetManWoman] would. My position might, on the whole, be stronger than it was before [From.GetSheHe] intervened.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5232;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5233;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5233;[From.GetBestName] has won the fight against various troublesome elements at my court, and in addition to significantly reducing the influence of those groups I have granted [From.GetHerHim] considerable authority as Grand Chancellor and have also granted several concessions to my various vassals.\nIt seems as if this is insufficient to convince [From.GetBestName] that I approve of [From.GetHerHis] victory, however, as [From.GetSheHe] has decided to view my neutrality as opposition.\n"Take the [Root.GetSonDaughterCap] someplace safe," [From.GetSheHe] orders [From.GetHerHis] guards. "I have a realm to manage in [Root.GetHerHis] absence.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5233;This is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5234;The [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5234;The forces of the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven fought against my forces before my victory at [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] palace, and I rather doubt it was all a misunderstanding.\nFor the good of the realm, I have given the order to transfer all the money in [Root.Liege.GetBestName]'s treasury into mine, as well as for a number of titles to be granted to me and my descendants in perpetuity. Some will no doubt see this as unjustifiable, but I think everyone would have done the same in my position.\nOf course, in addition to this I need to deal with the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5234;[Root.Liege.GetSheHeCap] should be imprisoned!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5234;[Root.Liege.GetSheHeCap] has outlived [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] usefulness!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5235;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5235;Though my forces fight bravely, they are not able to overcome those of [From.GetBestName].\nAt first, I hope that granting [From.GetBestName] extensive authority as my Grand Chancellor and giving all vassals more freedom will placate [From.GetHerHim], but it does not seem to impress [From.GetHerHim] sufficiently, and [From.GetSheHe] soon makes [From.GetHerHis] desires clear.\n"I think the realm would benefit from being restructured a bit," [From.GetSheHe] tells me. "I will also require all available funds." [From.GetSheHeCap] pauses for a moment, then turns to [From.GetHerHis] soldiers. "Oh, and take the [Root.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven someplace safe.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5235;This is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5236;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5236;Though my forces fight bravely, they are not able to overcome those of [From.GetBestName].\n"It is clear that the future prosperity of the realm will require quite a few changes," [From.GetSheHe] tells me when [From.GetSheHe] approaches me. [From.GetSheHeCap] hands over several documents. "These need the [Root.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's seal."\nSeeing no other option, I make the documents official, granting [From.GetBestName] extensive authority as Grand Chancellor and a number of other concessions.\n"Excellent," [From.GetBestName] says when I am done. "I have no further need of you." With that, [From.GetSheHe] pulls free a dagger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5236;But I gave you everything you wanted!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5237;[vassal_assisting.GetTitledFirstName]'s Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5237;Word has arrived from the court of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven that [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] and [vassal_assisting.GetHerHis] supporters have prevailed against various troublesome elements at court.\nIt seems [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] has been richly rewarded by [From.GetBestName], being granted broad authority as Grand Chancellor and also receiving assurances that [vassal_assisting.GetSheHe] and [vassal_assisting.GetHerHis] fellow vassals will have a freer hand from now on.\nWhether this will result in the realm prospering or in interesting times still remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5237;Perhaps this will benefit me...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5238;[vassal_assisting.GetTitledFirstName]'s Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5238;Word has arrived from the court of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven that [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] and [vassal_assisting.GetHerHis] supporters have prevailed against various troublesome elements at court.\n[vassal_assisting.GetBestName] has been richly rewarded by [From.GetBestName], being granted broad authority as Grand Chancellor and also receiving assurances that the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven will intervene less in local affairs.\nHowever, despite this, it seems [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] was dissatisfied with [From.GetBestName]'s rewards, seeing as [vassal_assisting.GetSheHe] has imprisoned the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_5239;Word has arrived from the court of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven that [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] and [vassal_assisting.GetHerHis] supporters have prevailed against various troublesome elements at court.\n[vassal_assisting.GetBestName] has been richly rewarded by [From.GetBestName], being granted broad authority as Grand Chancellor along with several other rewards, including a promise of less interference in local affairs.\nHowever, [vassal_assisting.GetBestName]'s messenger also brings word that this was the last official decree of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven before [From.GetHerHis] unexpected death.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5239;How "convenient"...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5240;The Will of Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5240;The fighting at my palace is over, and my forces are triumphant, having defeated both the forces of [From.GetBestName] and the forces of those [From.GetSheHe] expected to be [From.GetHerHis] only opposition.\nWith this victory, I am in a position to finally bring various troublesome elements at court to heel, to restrict the authority of my various vassals, and to depower my Grand Chancellor.\nLet all remember this day as an auspicious one, as it saw the [Root.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven triumph over [Root.GetHerHis] foes and saw [Root.GetHerHis] authority increased substantially as a result!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5240;Assuming direct control!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5241;The [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5241;The fighting at the palace of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] has not gone well, as [From.GetHerHis] forces have triumphed against all others. Escape is impossible, and those who yet live area captured by [From.GetBestName]'s forces.\nAt the moment, it is unclear what our fate will be, but the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven seems to have declared that we are all guilty of treason, and based on what our guards have been speaking about it seems the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's authority has been increased substantially, to the detriment of all others.\nPerhaps the realm will benefit from this day, but I will probably not.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5241;This did not go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_5242;The Will of Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5242;Though [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] doubtlessly would argue that [vassal_assisting.GetSheHe] only meant to do what was best for the realm and was not seeking personal power, many of [vassal_assisting.GetHerHis] captured soldiers have claimed otherwise. It is clear [vassal_assisting.GetSheHe] is too dangerous to trust.\nGiven my recent victory, none would dare question my will when it comes to how best to deal with [vassal_assisting.GetBestName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] must of course be weakened, but whether [From.GetSheHe] should be executed as a warning to others remains to be decided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5242;[vassal_assisting.GetSheHeCap] gets to live, for now...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_5248;[to_be_dealt_with.GetBestName] is brought before me in chains.

EVTDESC_SOH_5249;I have just received word that [traitor_vassal.GetBestName], seeing the way the wind was blowing, has seen fit to kill [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] and present [vassal_assisting.GetHerHis] head to my soldiers in exchange for mercy.\nThis mercy does of course not need to extend to anyone else that supported [vassal_assisting.GetBestName], but though I will be able to use this victory to weaken various interest groups at court it is clear that I will not be able to use it to also impose further restrictions on my vassals, as that would be most unwise at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_5252;[traitor_vassal.GetBestName] clearly expects to be rewarded for presenting the head of [vassal_assisting.GetBestName] to my soldiers and thus assuring my victory, and I have to admit that it is possible that [traitor_vassal.GetSheHe] did me a service.\nOf course, [traitor_vassal.GetBestName] did betray [traitor_vassal.GetHerHis] liege, and though it was to my benefit and that of the realm it potentially sets a dangerous precedent to reward a traitor, especially as I do not know if [traitor_vassal.GetBestName] truly is loyal to me or merely sought to save [traitor_vassal.GetHerHis] own skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
