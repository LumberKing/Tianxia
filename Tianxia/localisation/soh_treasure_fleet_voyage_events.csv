EVTDESC_SOH_8105;One day when I am walking around on the deck of the ship I accidentally bump into a sailor that's working on hoisting a crate of supplies aboard from a smaller boat that has rowed across from another ship, startling him and causing him to drop the rope.

EVTOPTB_SOH_8132;That sounds too much like work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8133;I make it clear during the discussion that the [Root.Religion.GetName] religion is the one and only true religion and that its teachings are the only ones that matter. Several of those present seem to think that I should have been more diplomatic, but I know the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8133;All must listen to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8134;I present all of my best arguments for why [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s words should be heeded and why the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith is the only faith worth believing in. The others at the gathering seem unconvinced, and some of them offer some counterpoints I have not heard in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8134;Could I be... wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8135;The religious discussion does not turn as heated as some such discussions have in the past. Everyone seems content to at least agree to disagree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8135;That was rather uneventful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8136;I find myself quite fascinated with some of the faiths discussed at the gathering. Some of them seem to be in favor of things that I also approve of, which I did not know before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8136;Their ways might have some merit...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8137;I find myself getting quite annoyed with some of those at the gathering that do not follow the [Root.Religion.GetName] religion and their claims that it is in favor of various things I know it isn't.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8137;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] did not say that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8138;The more I listen to what is being said at the gathering the more I feel that the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith does not hold all of the answers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8138;My faith is a lie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8139;I have not always felt that the [Root.Religion.GetName] speaks to me, but listening to some of the others at the gathering has made me reconsider some of my reservations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_8148;Late one evening when I am walking the decks of the ship I come across a group of sailors that appear to be about to start dining as a table has been set near where they are standing. They spot me and wave me over, with one of the men offering me a seat at the table, giving me a smile, red and white.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8148;I suppose I will join you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8148;I think I know what you're having!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_8148;I have other plans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_8149;I take a seat at the table and wait for the final preparations for the meal to be completed. I do not have to wait long, and the man that invited me to join them at the table motions for me to start eating, stating that there is no need for formality among friends. The meal is certainly filling, and the meat in particular is quite good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_8149;I take a seat at the table and wait for the final preparations for the meal to be completed. I do not have to wait long, and the man that invited me to join them at the table motions for me to start eating. The meal is certainly filling, and the meat in particular is quite good. It is only when the meal is over that I learn what they served.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8149;A lovely meal indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8149;I ate what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8150;The sailors appear to be somewhat upset to learn that I will not be joining them for their meal, but the man that spoke to me calms them down with a gesture. Turning back to me, he suggests that maybe I might feel like share a meal with them in the future. "There are always more seats at the red table.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8150;"The red table?" How odd...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8151;Almost as soon as I have refused the man's offer the other sailors go for their weapons and move to attack me, with their leader telling me that if I will not share their meal I will have to be part of their meal. I draw my own weapon and fight back, and it is not long before I have cut the cannibals down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8151;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8152;Almost as soon as I have refused the man's offer the other sailors go for their weapons and move to attack me, with their leader telling me that if I will not share their meal I will have to be part of their meal.

EVTOPTA_SOH_8153;No! No! No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8154;One day during the voyage I take a moment to look down into the unusally clear waters we are sailing to. I can see all the way to the bottom of the ocean and... Is that an eye, looking back at me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8154;We are beheld!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8154;IT SEES US!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8155;One evening when I am taking a walk on the deck of the ship my feet slip as I accidentally step in a small puddle. I try to catch myself on the railing, but fail to do so, and I drop into the water some distance away from the ship, seemingly without anyone having noticed what happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8155;I must swim to safety!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8156;I make my way back towards the ship and spot [treasure_fleet_savior.GetBestName] above me. I catch [treasure_fleet_savior.GetHerHis] attention and [treasure_fleet_savior.GetSheHe] offers to toss me a rope to help mr to safety, in exchange for a Favor to be repaid at a future date.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8156;I'll owe you one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8156;I don't need your help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8157;I accept the offer made by [treasure_fleet_savior.GetBestName] and [treasure_fleet_savior.GetSheHe] tosses me a rope as [treasure_fleet_savior.GetSheHe] said that [treasure_fleet_savior.GetSheHe] would, and I climb to safety easily enough. Hopefully, the Favor I now owe [treasure_fleet_savior.GetBestName] will not be too much to bear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8157;It was worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8158;I refuse [treasure_fleet_savior.GetBestName]'s offer to help me aboard the ship, unwilling to owe [treasure_fleet_savior.GetHerHim] a Favor, and instead climb up the side of the ship. It is rather difficult, and I start having second thoughts after a while, but eventually I manage to climb all the way to the top without assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8158;I can save myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8159;I refuse [treasure_fleet_savior.GetBestName]'s offer to help me aboard the ship, unwilling to owe [treasure_fleet_savior.GetHerHim] a Favor, and instead climb up the side of the ship. A wave hits me when I am halfway up, and I lose my grip. Though I try to swim back to the ship again I am unable to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8159;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8160;I make make way back towards the ship and start climbing up the side. It is a difficult climb, as the ship hardly was designed to let someone climb up its side, but I manage to make it all the way back up to the top and then pull myself to safety. Though the experience was unpleasant I have survived it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8160;I saved myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8161;I try to swim back towards the ship, but it is moving rather more quickly than I can swim, and I am unable to reach it. I cry out to catch the attention of anyone aboard, but nobody seems to notice me, and none of the other ships are close enough for me to reach them. I keep on swimming until my strength gives out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8161;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8162;Recently I have been spending some time in the company of [treasure_fleet_friend.GetBestName] as the two of us are passengers aboard the same ship, and though we did not know one another very well to begin with [treasure_fleet_friend.GetSheHe] and I have realized that we have a lot in common and that we enjoy each other's company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8162;[treasure_fleet_friend.GetSheHeCap] is a true friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8163;Recently I have been spending some time in the company of [From.GetBestName] as the two of us are passengers aboard the same ship, and though we did not know one another very well to begin with [From.GetSheHe] and I have realized that we have a lot in common and that we enjoy each other's company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8163;[From.GetSheHeCap] is a true friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8164;The journey from one port to another has given me time to get to know others aboard my ship. One of them, [treasure_fleet_lover.GetBestName], is a rather fascinating [treasure_fleet_lover.GetManWoman], and I have found myself enjoying [treasure_fleet_lover.GetHerHis] company quite a bit. Lately, I have been wondering if I should try for something more with [treasure_fleet_lover.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8164;I should seduce [treasure_fleet_lover.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8164;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8165;I have spent quite some time in the company of [From.GetBestName] recently, and the two of us have generally gotten along quite well. Even so, it is somewhat surprising when [From.GetSheHe] one day suggests that perhaps the two of us should find someplace private so that we might get to know one another more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8165;I like the way you think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8165;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8166;[From.GetBestName] informs ne that [From.GetSheHe] has no interest in getting to know me more intimately, and suggests that I drop the matter so that the two of us can pretend that I never brought it up in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8166;[treasure_fleet_lover.GetMenWomenCap]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8167;[From.GetBestName] was quite open to my suggestion that the two of us should find someplace private to get to know one another far more intimately. Some time later, after a rather enjoyable series of events, I find myself wondering whether I should try to sneak off somewhere with [From.GetBestName] again in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8167;I hope we'll do that again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8167;This won't happen again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8168;I and [From.GetBestName] find an empty cabin easily enough and spend some rather enjoyable time together. As the two of us start getting dressed again [From.GetSheHe] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] looks forward to the next time the two of us can meet in private again, and I find myself looking forward to it as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8168;I look forward to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8169;I and [From.GetBestName] find an empty cabin easily enough and spend some rather enjoyable time together. As the two of us start getting dressed again [From.GetSheHe] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] had a wonderful time but that it probably would be a good idea for the two of us not to make a habit out of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8169;Perhaps that's for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8171;Though I do not mind the company of most of the people aboard my ship [treasure_fleet_rival.GetBestName] is not someone whose company is remotely enjoyable. [treasure_fleet_rival.GetSheHeCap] always gets on my nerves, always contradicts me when it comes to even the smallest things, and is thoroughly unpleasant to have to deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8171;I hate [treasure_fleet_rival.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_8172;I hate [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8173;I am having trouble falling asleep one night and decide to take a walk on the deck of the ship. As I exit into the open I spot [treasure_fleet_rival_to_kill.GetBestName] standing near the railing some distance away. My hated rival does not appear to have noticed my presence, and [treasure_fleet_rival_to_kill.GetHerHis] position looks quite precarious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8173;[treasure_fleet_rival_to_kill.GetSheHeCap] must die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8173;It's too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8174;I am standing at the railing of the ship late one evening, looking out over the water and pondering various matters when I suddenly feel a hand on my back. Before I can react I am pushed over the railing and into the water below. I am not sure who my attacker was, and right now I need to focus on getting to safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8174;Survival first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8175;I manage to swim back to the ship and climb my way back aboard without too much difficulty. Taking a look around, I do not see anyone else, so my attacker probably saw fit to slip away while I was getting back to the ship, and their identity remains unknown to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8175;Who was it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8176;Doing my best to stay out of sight, I watch as [From.GetBestName] climbs back onto the ship. As best I can tell, [From.GetSheHe] is unaware that it was I who sent [From.GetHerHim] into the water, but even so [From.GetSheHe] is likely to be on [From.GetHerHis] guard from now on, making further attempts on [From.GetHerHis] life far riskier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8176;Unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8177;I try to swim back to the ship, but it is moving more quickly than I can swim, and thus it keeps getting further and further away. Though I cry out for help and hope that someone aboard one of the other ships will notice me, nobody comes to my rescue, and as I am quite far from the nearest shore I realize that I will not survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8177;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8178;[From.GetBestName] did not spot me when I pushed [From.GetHerHim] over the railing, and [From.GetSheHe] also did not notice that I was watching as [From.GetSheHe] failed to swim back to the ship. I do not get see [From.GetHerHim] drown due to the ship continuing onwards quite rapidly, but I am still quite satisfied with the outcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8178;Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8179;I am standing at the railing of the ship late one evening, looking out over the water and pondering various matters when I suddenly feel a hand on my back. I manage to turn around to see that the hand belongs to [From.GetBestName] before [From.GetSheHe] gives me a push and sends me over the railing and into the water below.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8179;[From.GetBestName] did it... and now I need to get back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8180;I manage to swim back to the ship and climb my way back aboard without too much difficulty. [FromFrom.GetBestName] is nowhere to be seen, as [FromFrom.GetSheHe] apparently saw fit to leave while I was in the water, and with no witnesses around it is unlikely to be possible to get [FromFrom.GetHerHim] locked up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8180;Unfortunately, I can't have [FromFrom.GetHerHim] arrested...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8181;Doing my best to stay out of sight, I watch as [From.GetBestName] climbs back onto the ship. [From.GetSheHeCap] saw me push [From.GetHerHim] into the water, and thus [From.GetSheHe] likely will be on [From.GetHerHis] guard from now on, particularly around me, making further attempts on [From.GetHerHis] life far riskier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8181;That was not the plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8182;I try to swim back to the ship, but it is moving more quickly than I can swim, and thus it keeps getting further and further away. Though I cry out for help and hope that someone aboard one of the other ships will notice me, nobody comes to my rescue, and as I am quite far from the nearest shore I realize that I will not survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8182;Avenge me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8183;[From.GetBestName] spotted me when I pushed [From.GetHerHim] over the railing, which might have been a problem if [From.GetSheHe] had managed to make [From.GetHerHis] way back to the ship. Luckily for me, that did not happen, though some sailors saw the incident. Their words are not sufficient to get me arrested here, but [From.GetBestName]'s kin might learn of my actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8183;Unfortunately word will spread...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8184;I am standing at the railing of the ship late one evening, looking out over the water and pondering various matters when I suddenly feel a hand on my back. The hand gives me a push, clearly attempting to send me over the railing, but I avoid falling into the water. My assailant manages to vanish before I can see who it was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8184;Who was that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8185;My attempt to push [From.GetBestName] overboard did not work out, and [From.GetSheHe] nearly saw me as U hurried away after the failed attempt. I manage to get back inside and into hiding before [From.GetBestName] sees who I am, and [From.GetSheHe] is unlikely to know for certain that it was I who attacked [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8185;At least I wasn't seen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8186;I am standing at the railing of the ship late one evening, looking out over the water and pondering various matters when I suddenly feel a hand on my back. The hand gives me a push, clearly attempting to send me over the railing, but I manage to stay aboard the ship. Turning around, I can see [From.GetBestName] running away from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8186;You! I know it was you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8187;My attempt to push [From.GetBestName] overboard did not work out, and [From.GetSheHe] managed to see me as I hurried away, as evident by the fact that [From.GetSheHe] cursed my name. Luckily for me, [From.GetBestName] was too preoccupied to give chase, and with no witnesses to support [From.GetHerHim] I am unlikely to get locked up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8187;You can't prove anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8188;I am standing at the railing of the ship late one evening, looking out over the water and pondering various matters when I hear someone moving up behind me. I quickly dodge out of the way as [From.GetBestName] attempts to push me over the railing. I take the opportunity to return the favor, sending [From.GetHerHim] into the water below.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8188;Turnabout is fair play!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8189;I attempt to sneak up on [From.GetBestName] to push [From.GetHerHim] over the railing, but as I draw close [From.GetSheHe] suddenly turns around and gives me a smile as [From.GetSheHe] dodges out of the way. Surprised by this development, I am caught off balance, and as a result I am sent over the railing and into the water below.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8189;No, no, no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8190;[FromFrom.GetBestName] is nowhere to be seen when I climb back onto the ship, but I am certain that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] will be keeping [FromFrom.GetHerHis] guard up around me from now on and that any further attacks I might make are even less likely to succeed. Even worse, [From.GetSheHe] might seek to strike at me first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8190;At least I am alive...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8191;I watch as [From.GetBestName] swims back towards the ship and make sure that to disappear from sight before [From.GetSheHe] has climbed back aboard. It seems my attacker will remain alive and that [From.GetSheHe] might trouble me again in the future, but at least I managed to foil this particular attempt on my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8191;At least I know to watch my back now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8192;I try to swim back to the ship, but it is moving more quickly than I can swim, and thus it keeps getting further and further away. Though I cry out for help and hope that someone aboard one of the other ships will notice me, nobody comes to my rescue, and as I am quite far from the nearest shore I realize that I will not survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8192;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8193;I watch as [From.GetBestName] attempts to swim back to the ship, quite pleased to notice that [From.GetSheHe] is getting further and further away from it. [From.GetSheHeCap] is still alive when I lose sight of [From.GetHerHim], but I am confident that [From.GetSheHe] will not manage to reach safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8193;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8194;One day I notice a school of dolphins a short distance away from my ship. They do not seem to be paying me or the Treasure Fleet much attention, and instead seem preoccupied with making small jumps above the waves for some unknown reason. Whatever the reason might be, they put on quite the show.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8194;A very pleasant sight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8195;I am taking a walk across the deck of my ship and decide to head to the stern to get a closer look at some interesting clouds behind the ship, but when I get there I notice movement in the water and forget all about the clouds. There are several rather large sharks following the ship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8195;I really hope I don't fall overboard...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8196;One day when I look down into the water beneath the ship I spot a large number of turtles swimming past, several of them quite large. As best I can tell they do not seem to care about the ships above their heads, and I suppose that they have little reason to concern themselves with such things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8196;How majestic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8197;My ship has been sent some distance away from the main body of the Treasure Fleet to scout the seas ahead, and though I had not expected to find anything of interest we have discovered a drifting ship. As best I can tell, it is largely intact, but there is no crew to be seen, which is quite odd as it hardly could sail itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8197;We must investigate it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8197;It is too dangerous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8198;I order the captain to sail closer to the other ship and jump across alongside several of the sailors, weapons at the ready. The drifting ship is much smaller than our ship, so it does not take us long to search every part of it for its crew, but there does not appear to be anyone else aboard the ship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8198;How odd...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8199;I order the captain to sail closer to the other ship and jump across alongside several of the sailors, weapons at the ready. The drifting ship is much smaller than our ship, so it does not take us long to search every part of it for its crew, and eventually we find a pile of bodies in one of the rooms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8199;And yet no sign of anyone alive...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8200;I order the captain to sail closer to the other ship and jump across alongside several of the sailors, weapons at the ready. The drifting ship is much smaller than our ship, so it does not take us long to search every part of it for its crew. Suddenly, a man bearing a wicked sword drops down from the ceiling right in front of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8200;To me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8201;The man laughs as he attacks me and the sailors with me, and his attacks are quite fierce. However, once the initial surprise wears off I have little trouble defending myself, and it is not long before he has been overwhelmed and killed. Once he has been dealt with the search continues, but there is nobody else aboard the ship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8201;The crew has been avenged!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8202;The man laughs as he attacks me and the sailors with me, and his attacks are quite fierce. I take a few rather minor wounds before the surprise wears off, but once it does I and the others manage to kill our assailant. Once he has been dealt with the search continues, but there is nobody else aboard the ship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8202;A tolerable outcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8203;The man laughs as he attacks me and the sailors with me, and his attacks are quite fierce. I and the others struggle quite a bit to fight back, and I take a rather nasty wound before one of the sailors finally cuts the man down. Once he has been dealt with the search continues, but there is nobody else aboard the ship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8203;He almost got me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8204;The man laughs as he attacks me and the sailors with me, and his attacks are quite fierce. Several of the sailors go down before they really notice that he is there, and though I do my best to fight back he overcomes my defenses and manages to inflict a mortal wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8204;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8205;My ship has been sent some distance away from the main body of the Treasure Fleet to scout the seas ahead, and though I had not expected to find anything interesting we have come across a small island that does not appear on any of the maps I have seen. Perhaps there is something to be discovered on it, seeing as it does not appear to be well known...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8205;We head ashore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8205;It would be a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8206;I order the ship to drop anchor and for a boat to be readied to bring me and some of the sailors ashore. It does not take us long to investigate the entirety of the island, and to my surprise we discover a rather unusual item atop a small pedestal on top of a small hill, which I claim as my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8206;This might be useful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8207;I order the ship to drop anchor and for a boat to be readied to bring me and some of the sailors ashore. It does not take us long to investigate the entirety of the island, and on the opposite shore from where we came ashore I find the skeleton of a past explorer, clutching a strange map.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8207;A curious find...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8208;I order the ship to drop anchor and for a boat to be readied to bring me and some of the sailors ashore. It does not take us long to investigate the entirety of the island, and there does not appear to be anything particularly noteworthy on it. Perhaps this explains why nobody ever bothered to put it on a map.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8208;Back to the ship!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8209,One night as I walk the decks of my ship I spot a thunderstorm in the distance. I watch it for some time, trying to determine if it is drawing any closer. Just as I am about to turn away from it I see a ghostly ship beneath it, which almost seems to be flying above the water...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8209;An ominous portent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8210;Day after day I find it difficult to just keep on living. Sometimes I wonder if life is even worth living. Maybe I should just jump from the ship...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8210;Goodbye, cruel world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8210;I have things to live for...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8211;The Treasure Fleet's voyage has been rather exciting, and I can barely wait to find out what is next. I have so much to look forward to, and life once more feels worth living.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8211;This voyage was a good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8212;After dinner I went for a walk on the ship, taking in the sunset and generally having an enjoyabe time. As I was about to head back inside some of the sailors noticed me and asked if I wanted to join them for a drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8212;Of course I want a drink!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8212;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8213;The drink provided by the sailors was a vile concoction unlike anything I had tasted before. I tried to be polite and keep drinking, which worked at first, but now I feel rather queasy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8213;Get out of the way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8214;The drink I got from the sailors was rather bland, and I drank it all without thinking much about it. I did not feel any effects of it in the evening, but in the morning I woke up with the worst headache I have ever had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8214;My head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8215;I do not remember much of the rest of the evening, but when I wake up in the morning several people are willing to tell me all about it. Apparently one of least embarrassing things I did was to strip naked and run around screaming at the top of my lungs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8215;I made a fool of myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8216;The evening passes without anything particularly interesting happening. The sailors are not the worst company, but they are also not a terribly interesting lot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8216;I guess that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8217;In the past I have frequently tried to abstain from drinking anything stronger than water, but after sharing a drink with the sailors I have discovered that it is not so bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8217;I should maybe drink more often...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8218;I share several drinks with the sailors, but after about half a dozen they start excusing themselves one after the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8218;Is that all you can drink?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8219;One drink turns into two drinks, and then three. The sailors are happy to share what they have, and I see no reason to stop drinking anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8219;Bring me another!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8220;I know what stirs in the east! I know what lies in the frozen city! I know that that is not dead which can eternal lie... and with strange aeons even death may die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8220;The stars are nearly right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8220;...or are they maybe left?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8221;The voyage aboard the Treasure Fleet has been rather uneventful as of late, and as a result I have found the time to both deal with various things I have had on my mind and to relax a bit as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8221;I feel like a new person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8222;Several sailors were recently injured when some ropes unexpectedly broke and sent them falling to the deck. As someone skilled in medicine, I offered what assistance I could, and several of the injured sailors are expected to make a full recovery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8222;My skills were appreciated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8223;While the Treasure Fleet has not run out of food yet its supplies are not as extensive now as they were a while back, and all aboard have had to eat a bit less as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8223;I've lost some weight...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8224;Today some of the sailors dropped a plank as I was walking beneath where they were working. Their cries of warning came too late for me to move out of the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8224;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8225;I have from time to time heard that I likely am one of the more beautiful people travelling with the Treasure Fleet. It seems this might not just be flattery, seeing as a sailor by the name of [sex_partner.GetFirstName] propositioned me today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8225;I'm so glad you found me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8225;One time only, I think...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_8225;What? No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8226;Though the Treasure Fleet certainly is in close proximity to water it is not always possible to stay as clean as I normally would during the voyage. My appearance has suffered somewhat as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8226;I suppose this is fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8227;I have occasionally been called upon to join various discussions concerning important matters during the Treasure Fleet's voyage, and I have been told that my input always is quite valuable due to my extensive knowledge of various things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8227;I am rather smart, yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8228;Today I was once more invited to a discussion concerning matters of importance to the Treasure Fleet. I could tell that many of the other participants were not pleased to see me, and that they thought that the answers I provided were less than good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8228;They all think me a fool!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8229;Though I and the other notable passengers aboard the Treasure Fleet are not expected to work alongside the sailors outside an emergency I have occasionally offered to help out when I have had nothing better to do. They always seem to think that I am rather helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8229;My strength is appreciated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8230;Today there was an unexpected development aboard the Treasure Fleet, and I was asked to help carry some crates of various supplies from one place to another. Unfortunately, the crates were rather heavy, and it turned out that I only was in the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8230;They all think less of me now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8231;There are many things to keep track of during the Treasure Fleet's voyage, such as the state of various supplies, punishments handed out to various sailors, and items lost overboard. I was recently in a position to help out with some of the records, and made a notable contribution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8231;That wasn't so hard...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8232;Today as I was taking a walk on the deck of the ship some of the sailors approached me and asked if I wanted to take part in an impromptu sparring contest, seeing as I am known for being a rather good duelist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8232;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8232;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8233;The sailors put up a good fight when facing off against me, but I am in no real danger of losing any of the duels. They do not seem to mind, however, as they thank me for teaching them some useful skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8233;They appreciated what I can do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8234;I and the sailors spar for some time, and things go rather decently. Some of the sailors are poorer opponents, while others prove quite the challenge. One of them even manages to beat me handidly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8234;Not bad! Not bad at all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8235;The sparring session starts out poorly, and then gets even worse. The sailors are formidable opponents, and one of them manages to wound me while we are facing off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8235;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8235;Guards! Seize that man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8236;As I took a walk across the deck of the ship today I came across some sailors finishing up a game of weiqi. Noticing that I was paying attention to the game, the winner offered to play against me, suggesting that we make it interesting by putting some money on the line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8236;You're on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8236;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8237;The game goes on for some time. My opponent knows what he is doing, and I start to feel that I might lose in the end, but then I notice a tiny flaw in my opponent's strategy. Exploiting it, I manage to capture the majority of his pieces, and he is forced to concede as we both know he cannot recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8237;Victory is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8238;The game goes on for some time. I have the upper hand, and my strategy feels like a winning one. Then my opponent pauses for a moment, takes a long look at the board, and places one of his pieces in a different spot than he initially seemed to be considering. Soon, I realize that he is about to capute most of my pieces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8238;It seems I have lost...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8239;Before departing from the Middle Kingdom, I resolved to get some reading done during the trip, seeing as there are plenty of books on a variety of topics I have been meaning to get to. However, I have so far not managed to put in much of an effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8239;I should read some of the books...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8239;I would rather just relax...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8240;I manage to make my way through several books concerning military matters over the course of the next few days, and also come up with some ways I might be able to use what I have learned to my advantage in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8240;Knowledge is power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8241;I manage to make my way through several books concerning construction techniques over the course of the next few days, and also come up with some ways I might be able to use what I have learned to my advantage in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8241;Knowledge is power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8242;I manage to make my way through several books concerning legal matters over the course of the next few days, and also come up with some ways I might be able to use what I have learned to my advantage in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8242;Knowledge is power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8243;I manage to make my way through several books concerning a variety of matters over the course of the next few days, and also come up with some ways I might be able to use what I have learned to my advantage in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8243;Knowledge is power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8244;I manage to make my way through several books concerning a variety of matters over the course of the next few days, but even though they supposedly are highly regarded I cannot seem to discover any new insights from any them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8244;I must be missing something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8245;Though the Treasure Fleet is formidable enough that only a fool would attack it and its mission primarily is a diplomatic one, the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven did see fit to asign a large amount of soldiers to it. Perhaps I should spend some time trying to figure out how best to make use for them, should the need arise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8245;It wouldn't hurt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8245;That sounds like a waste of my time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8246;I spend some time meeting with several of the officers put in command of the soldiers accompanying the Treasure Fleet, getting to know them and discussing the forces at their command. I get a better idea for how I might be able to make use of them, and feel that they have gained a newfound respect for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8246;My contingencies have contingencies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8247;I meet up with a few of the officers accompanying the Treasure Fleet to discuss their soldiers and how they might best be used if the need arises. They are somewhat reluctant to discuss the matter, but I gain a few minor insights out of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8247;It's better than nothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8248;Though I attempt to meet up with some of the officers accompanying the Treasure Fleet they are not very eager to speak to me, and the few discussions I manage to have end in a manner that makes me think that they do not really respect me. I learned nothing of value about their forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8248;That went poorly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8250;Today I felt inspired and sat down to write a poem about my home in [Root.Capital.GetName]. I have gained a newfound appreciation for it of late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8250;I hope to see it soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8251;Today I felt inspired and sat down to write a poem about the sea, seeing as it has been on my mind a lot lately. I feel I managed to capture my feelings quite well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8251;The sea can be beautiful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8252;Today I felt inspired and sat down to write a poem about storms, as there was one visible in the distance. I think my work was quite good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8252;Majestic, but deadly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8253;Today I felt inspired and sat down to write a poem. I have been seeing a lot of different kinds of fishes recently, some quite different from those I have seen closer to home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8253;They can be rather interesting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8254;Today I felt inspired and sat down to write a poem about ships. The Treasure Fleet recently passed by a number of others that were of a design I had never seen in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8254;They were a sight to behold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8255;[poet_target.GetBestName] is a rather fascinating [poet_target.GetManWoman], and quite attractive as well. I wish [poet_target.GetSheHe] would speak with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8255;I'll write [poet_target.GetHerHim] a poem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8255;Actually, that's a terrible idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8257;It seems [poet_target.GetBestName] really appreciated my poem, seeing as [poet_target.GetSheHe] came to see me today. We talked for a while before [poet_target.GetSheHe] suggested that perhaps [poet_target.GetHerHis] appreciation was best shown in a more private location, and perhaps on multiple occasions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8257;An exellent idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8257;I suppose, this once...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_8257;You misunderstood my intentions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8258;I arranged for my poem to be delivered to [poet_target.GetBestName] once it was ready, but [poet_target.GetSheHe] has not responded to it in any way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8258;Maybe [poet_target.GetSheHe] never got it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8259;I received a response from [poet_target.GetBestName] today. Unfortunately, it was not at all what I was hoping for. [poet_target.GetSheHeCap] informed me that I should cease bothering her, especially with my poor attempt at poetry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8259;[poet_target.GetSheHeCap] could have put it more kindly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8260;I have recently overheard several of the others aboard my ship complain about how they have not met as many exotic people to sleep with during the Treasure Fleet's voyage. They seem to have misunderstood the mission that the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven sent us on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8260;I don't think that was the goal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8261;Recently I have realized that I miss the opportunity to meet new attractive people back in [Root.Capital.GetName]. Normally, I would not really think about such things, but the comparatively bland people I am stuck with aboard the Treasure Fleet has made me reconsider.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8261;This is not what I expected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8262;Even when supplies are plentiful the Admiral has ordered a certain amount of rationing aboard the ships of the Treasure Fleet. Many have complained about this, but I am not one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8262;I'm fine with it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8263;Though I rarely tend to eat overly much and tend to be satisfied with relatively modest meals I have recently found the food that has been provided aboard my ship to be rather underwhelming. I miss several of the dishes my servants occasionally prepare back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8263;I'll have them make something nice when I return!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8264;Many of the others that travel aboard the ships of the Treasure Fleet seem to find the opportunity to relax at sea to be quite nice. I, on the other hand, find myself frequently bored by the calm voyage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8264;Is there really nothing to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8265;Though I normally do not mind working hard I have found it surprisingly pleasant to be able to relax a bit aboard the Treasure Fleet. I have previously been told that I work too hard, and perhaps there is some truth to that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8265;Maybe I should relax more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8266;Today I had the opportunity to help out with some of the record-keeping aboard the Treasure Fleet, which was the first real work available in quite some time. Several other officials had already come up with excuses to avoid doing the work, which I found rather odd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8266;At last there's something to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8267;I have noticed that several of the others travelling aboard my ship have been pestering the captain lately about when we are expected to reach the next port where the Treasure Fleet will drop anchor. It seems they can hardly wait to be ashore, unlike me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8267;I don't mind the wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8268;I normally consider myself a fairly patient [Root.GetManWoman], but of late I have found myself a bit restless. The Treasure Fleet should surely be making port soon, unless I am reading the maps wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8268;Are we there yet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8269;Today I heard several of the other officials aboard my ship talking with the captain, complaining about the quality of their cabins. As best I can tell, their cabins are no worse than mine, so I do not really know why they bother complaining.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8269;This is fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8270;Today I was asked to move into another cabin as a passenger was transferring from another ship and needed mine. I had been told that the new cabin would be similar to the one I was moving out of, but it was quite clear that it was not as good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8270;I expected better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8271;I joined the Treasure Fleet to see strange new cities, to seek out interesting people, and to boldly proposition them as no [Root.GetManWoman] has before. Instead I find myself stuck on a ship most of the time, surrounded by people that generally are less attractive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8271;This isn't what I expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8272;Back home, I am used to spending quite some time chasing after attractive people, which I do not have much opportunity of doing aboard a ship. However, while I initially found it a bit unusual, I have started to realize that perhaps I do not mind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8272;Maybe I should change...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8273;The meal I was served today was much smaller than I had expected, and rather bland as well. When asking about it, the servants told me that the Admiral apparently has ordered rationing even though the Treasure Fleet still has plenty of supplies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8273;That's preposterous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8274;I had initially expected to find the rationing aboard the Treasure Fleet to be difficult to bear, but I have not found it particularly unbearable. To be sure, I occasionally find myself hoping for something a bit more exciting, but not very often.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8274;Perhaps I can eat a bit less...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8275;I have noticed that there are some officials with the Treasure Fleet that seem to be finding it difficult to become accustomed to the lack of work aboard the Treasure Fleet. I, on the other hand, find it quite enjoyable to not have much to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8275;This is so relaxing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8276;As I am making my way back to my cabin one night a couple of sailors going the opposite way bump into me, almost causing me to trip. They continue on their way as if nothing have happened, despite it obviously being clear that they should apologize.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8276;You'll pay for that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8276;I'll let it slide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8277;I call out to the sailors, causing them to turn around right as I throw my first punches at their faces. They are taken completely by surprise, and though they attempt to fight back they can't put up much of a resistance. I give them quite the bruising before they realize that they should offer me an apology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8277;That'll teach them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8278;I turn around and head after the sailors, trying to trip them in turn, but the attempt fails. Soon, we are all trading blows, and the whole thing turns into a messy brawl. I still get some satisfaction from it, but it is clear there will be no apology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8278;Let's call it a draw!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8279;I punch one of the sailors and manage to land a fairly good blow, but his companions quickly come to his defense, and I take quite the beating. In the end, I am forced to apologize for attacking them, even though they provoked me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8279;That went... poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8280;At first I found my quarters aboard the ship rather cramped and much plainer than I had expected, but over the course of the journey I have started to realize that they are not so bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8280;I can live with this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8281;Today I was asked to move into another cabin aboard the ship as there apparently was another passenger that needed to be moved into my cabin. The new one I received was nowhere near as grand as my old one, despite assurances that it would be the best one available.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8281;This just won't do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8282;I have always wanted great things, but over the course of this voyage I have started to realize that I have experienced and achieved a great many things. Perhaps my ambition has its limits...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8282;Now what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8283;New lands, new cities, new peoples, and new experiences are all things that await us during this voyage. Some of the others seem to think that the voyage has little more to offer, but I know they are wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8283;I am not yet content!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8284;There are those aboard the ships of the Treasure Fleet that seem to want more all the time, and that might not be satisfied with this voyage even by the time that it ends despite all that they will have had the opportunity to experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8284;I have all I need...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8285;In the past, I have not really tried to achieve much in life, seeing as what I had was fairly good, but this voyage has given me time to reflect, and change might be in order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8285;I now know I want more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8286;Each night I see shapes moving around in the darkness and hear whispered conversations outside the window of my cabin. Everyone else seems to dismiss my words, claiming that it is at most sailors going about their business, but that cannot possibly be the case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8286;I am sure there is someone among us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8287;Out here, on the water, we are beyond the reach of just about everyone that is not part of the Treasure Fleet, and the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven would surely not have allowed untrustworthy people to join the voyage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8287;Maybe I am safe here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8288;Though the ship I am aboard is far larger than most that are not part of the Treasure Fleet, it is still full of people, and I do not know very many of them that well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8288;I'll just avoid them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8289;Today when I returned to my cabin I could not find my coin purse. I thought I had left it in the chest where I store most of the belongings I have brought with me on the voyage, but it is not there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8289;I must have lost it elsewhere...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8290;Today some of the Muslim sailors aboard my ship approached me and asked me if I could quote some inspiring passages from the Qur'an, seeing as I am a well-known Faqih. They praised my memory when I had finished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8290;Allahu akbar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8291;Today I chanced upon another sailor that apparenly also has an interest in... extralegal methods of acquiring goods on the high seas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8291;Arr, matey!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8292;Spending so much time in the company of sailors has made me consider the virtues of the piratical lifestyle, seeing as I know some people would expect me to have an interest in such things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8292;A pirate's life for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8292;Me, a pirate? I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8294;Today I chanced upon a bored-looking officer aboard the ship, who apparently was looking for a diversion from the tedium of just waiting around at sea. He has offered to teach me the Way of the Dog, in exchange for a modest amount of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8294;A worthwhile investment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8294;I'd rather keep my money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8295;Today I chanced upon a bored-looking officer aboard the ship, who apparently was looking for a diversion from the tedium of just waiting around at sea. He has offered to teach me the Way of the Dragon, in exchange for a modest amount of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8295;A worthwhile investment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8295;I'd rather keep my money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8296;Today I chanced upon a bored-looking officer aboard the ship, who apparently was looking for a diversion from the tedium of just waiting around at sea. He has offered to teach me the Way of the Leopard, in exchange for a modest amount of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8296;A worthwhile investment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8296;I'd rather keep my money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8297;Today I chanced upon a bored-looking officer aboard the ship, who apparently was looking for a diversion from the tedium of just waiting around at sea. He has offered to teach me the Way of the Tiger, in exchange for a modest amount of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8297;A worthwhile investment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_8297;I'd rather keep my money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8298;There are many officials travelling with the Treasure Fleet, and though most of them seem to want to relax while it is out at see some seem to find that a bit boring. A few of them have taken the opportunity to teach me a few things about finding diplomatic solutions to problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8298;Learning new things is fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8299;There are many officials travelling with the Treasure Fleet, and though most of them seem to want to relax while it is out at see some seem to find that a bit boring. A few of them have taken the opportunity to teach me a few things about the Art of War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8299;Learning new things is fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8300;There are many officials travelling with the Treasure Fleet, and though most of them seem to want to relax while it is out at see some seem to find that a bit boring. A few of them have taken the opportunity to teach me a few things about how to manage a realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8300;Learning new things is fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8301;There are many officials travelling with the Treasure Fleet, and though most of them seem to want to relax while it is out at see some seem to find that a bit boring. A few of them have taken the opportunity to teach me a few things about discovering falsehoods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8301;Learning new things is fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8302;There are many officials travelling with the Treasure Fleet, and though most of them seem to want to relax while it is out at see some seem to find that a bit boring. A few of them have taken the opportunity to teach me a few things about history, religion, and related matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8302;Learning new things is fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8303;There are so many nice people aboard the Treasure Fleet. They all treat me with kindness, and I am kind towards them too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8303;This just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8304;There are so many fun places to play aboard the ship, and so many fun things to do. I have fun climing the masts, running around on deck, and playing hide-and-seek.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8304;This just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8305;I have seen that many of the adults travelling with the Treasure Fleet consider themselves to be better than the sailors. Obviously, that means I am too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8305;This just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8306;I would rather spend my time running around or learning how to fight than sit with the boring books some of the adults think I should read during the voyage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8306;This just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8307;When the adults aboard the ship give me something to do, I do it at once and do it as well as I can, because it is obviously important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8307;This just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8308;Things are just so disorderly aboard the Treasure Fleet. I try organizing things properly when I can, even when some of the adults think I take it too far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8308;This just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8309;I have seen that some of the adults aboard the Treasure Fleet like to think things over carefully before they do anything, and I want to do the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8309;This just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8310;Like some of the adults aboard the ship, I just want to take it easy while we are at sea. Boring lessons and exhausting exercise can wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8310;This just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8311;Some of the adults travelling on my ship have been trying to impose rules on me. I do not like them, and want to do what I want, when I want to do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8311;This just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8312;There are so many interesting things to learn, and so many interesting things to see. I want to know more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8312;This just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8313;There are so many inspiring people aboard the Treasure Fleet. I want to be more like them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8313;This just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8314;I saw sosme of the sailors fighting today, and they both walked away with missing teeth. I would not want to get into a fight, or get someone angry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8314;This just feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8315;The journey from one port to another is a good time for the people aboard the Treasure Fleet to spend some time with each other. I have come to realize that this becomes more pleasant when everyone treats everyone else with kindness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8315;Kindness is not a weakness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8316;Some of the officials travelling with the Treasure Fleet think rather highly of themselves and look down on nearly everyone else, and I do not enjoy their company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8316;I will never be like them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8317;I have heard some of the others travelling with the Treasure Fleet speaking of their plans for the voyage and beyond. Many of those plans sound quite grand, and I cannot really understand why they are not happy with what they have, like me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8317;I am content to be content!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8318;The Treasure Fleet did not manage to find as many apples in the last port it visited as expected, and today there were not enough to go around. When I saw this, I offered to share mine with one of the officers aboard the ship, who thanked me and said I set a good example.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8318;Sharing is caring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8319;Today I met [new_friend.GetBestName], a younger member of the ship's crew. I had a lot of fun with [new_friend.GetHerHim], and [new_friend.GetSheHe] clearly enjoyed my company too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8319;We will always be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8320;I have noticed that not all of the sailors are truthful when their officers question them about their work, but that they do not seem to be getting into trouble due to this. The truth, it seems, might not always be best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8320;A lie a day makes your problems go away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8321;Sometimes some of the adults aboard the ship seem to think that I should be focusing more on studying than on enjoying my time with the Treasure Fleet. However, I seem to be able to convince them to let me have my fun most of the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8321;You just need to say the right thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8322;Today one of the younger sailors thought that he was in charge when we were playing and refused to listen to me. I made an example of him to the rest of those we play with, and they all obey me now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8322;Look what you made me do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8323;The captain of the ship just came to see me, informing me that he has heard from several of the sailors that I keep getting in their way. I have been asked to stay away from the masts, the railings, the ropes, and all the other fun places, at least for the rest of the day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8323;But I just wanted to pray!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8324;I have always known I was special, and not just because of how the servants treat me. Unlike most children in the Middle Kingdom, I get to go on a voyage like this, and that means the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven surely knows how great I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8324;Clearly I am one of the best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8325;One of the maids serving one of the officials aboard the Treasure Fleet was sentenced to flogging today after I caught her trying to steal from one of the other passengers. She begged me to convince her master to show her mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8325;But I want you to suffer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8326;I was playing a game with some of the other children aboard the ship and seemed about to lose when I realized that I could win if I just played a bit... differently. It was obvious what I had to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8326;Rules are meant to be broken!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8327;One night when I take a walk on the deck of the ship some of younger sailors grab me and tell me that they do not appreciate the way I have been acting, and that I might want to change my ways. Several of them give me a punch or a kick to show how little they appreciate my behaviour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8327;How dare they!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8328;One night when I take a walk on the deck of the ship someone throws a sack over my head and starts dragging me somewhere. Before I can free myself from their grip I feel myself being lifted into the air. I get thrown off the ship and strike the water below.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8328;I need to get back aboard the ship!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8329;While growing up I have spent quite a bit of time fighting with the other children, and I have continued doing that aboard the Treasure Fleet. The other passengers do not always approve, but that does not matter to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8329;I feel strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8330;Some of the officials aboard the ship have expressed their concern that I keep getting into fights and miss the lessons they think I should have. I think both the officials and the lessons are boring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8330;I don't need to know things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8331;Today the captain of the ship came to see me, telling me that some of the sailors seem to have started to dislike me because they have gotten into trouble due to me being honest when someone has asked what those sailors have been doing. He asked me to maybe not be so honest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8331;But I will tell the truth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8332;Some of the adults seem to think that I am living dangerously as I like to climb the masts of the ship even when I am alone. They think it might be too risky, and have asked me to maybe stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8332;I laugh in the face of danger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8333;Today I was challenged to a fight by one of the younger sailors, who apparently thought I was treating him disrespectfully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8333;Come on, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8334;My teachers aboard the Treasure Fleet have tried to assign me quite a lot of tasks to keep me occupied, but they always seem surprised when I finish them in short order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8334;Hard work pays off!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8335;Some of the adults travelling aboard my ship have expressed concern that I sometimes seem to be skipping meals, even though I eat as much as I want to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8335;I'll eat when I am hungry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8336;Having noticed that I seem to enjoy rules, some of the adults aboard the Treasure Fleet have given me some books on laws for me to read. I think them all very reasonable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8336;Rules are to be followed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8337;Several of the officials travelling aboard my ship have praised me because I always seem to follow the rules and always do what I am asked to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8337;I'm only doing what's right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8338;I have noticed that some of the adults aboard my ship prefer to get tasks done as quickly as possible, even if that makes the result worse. I, on the other hand, would rather spend more time to make it go well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8338;It will take the time it takes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8339;When the adults aboard my ship ask me to do something I work as hard as I have to in order to make sure that they are satisfied with the result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8339;It should be perfect!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8340;Some of the adults with the Treasure Fleet have expressed concern that I tend to insist on things being in a certain way. They seem to think that I should compromise more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8340;But I want it my way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8341;Today some of the sailors got annoyed with me because I interrupted them when they were rearranging some supply crates. I only told them that they not sorting them properly, which will make finding the right thing much harder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8341;Everything should be in it's place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8342;I have been spending a lot of the time aboard the ship inside my cabin, reading whichever books I have been able to borrow from the adults travelling with me. I have learned so much, and never want to stop reading.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8342;Reading is quite fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8343;I have spent a lot of time watching the other people aboard my ship. They seem to have so many nice things, and to know so many interesting people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8343;I want what they have!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8344;I have spent quite some time during the voyage alone with my thoughts. Some of the adults have expressed concern that I am not trying to get to know the younger sailors, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8344;I don't need people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8345;Today I overheard some of the adults talking about me. They have noticed that I often refuse to spend time with the sailors close to my age, as if I think I am better than them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8345;Maybe I am haughty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8346;I have been watching some of the adults aboard my ship latetly, realizing that most of them seem to want to spend the time at sea taking it easy if at all possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8346;They set a good example!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8347;Some of the adults aboard my ship have occasionally tried to get me to do more with my time, but almost all of them have relented once I have told them my reasons for not doing much. It seems I have a way with words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8347;This could be useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8348;The captain of the ship came to see me today and told me that some of the sailors had complained about me not doing things in a timely fashion, such as when I did not pack my belongings ahead of when they wanted me to move to a different cabin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8348;They think I am useless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8349;Today I scared one of the officials aboard my ship when I used a rope to swing from one mast to another. He asked me not to do it again, claiming it was dangerous and that I might kill myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8349;Dangerous? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8350;The voyage with the Treasure Fleet has been quite nice, and it has really shown me that there is a lot more to life than what I might find at [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8350;I want more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8351;It seems some of the adults aboard my ship are getting concerned by the fact that I frequently insist that things should be a certain way. They seem to think there are other options that might be just as good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8351;It has to be my way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8352;Some of the younger sailors seem to think that I am no fun to play with because I insist to be in charge. They seem to think that we are all equals when we play, which is not right at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8352;I am better than them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8353;Today some of the officials aboard my ship tried to make me attend one of their boring meetings about the state of the Treasure Fleet, apparently thinking that it would be good for me to know what is going on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8353;But I don't want to!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8354;I have learned so much during the voyage, and I never want to stop learning. Some might say that there are other, more useful things to do with my time than to read books and ask questions, but I know better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8354;Knowledge is power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8355;Not all sailors aboard the Treasure Fleet follow the [Root.Religion.GetBestName] faith, or even a similar faith. I have learned quite a bit about their customs during the voyage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8355;Such interesting ways!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8356;Learning new things is not always quick, and some people might find it boring. I, on the other hand, do not particularly mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8356;If it takes time, it takes time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8357;As I am exploring the ship one day I fail to watch where I am going and bump into a sailor holding a rope, causing him to drop it. The crate he was hoisting comes crashing down, and I see I will not have enough time to move out of the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8357;This will hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8358;I have taken time during the voyage to try to learn what I can from the officals aboard my ship, and though some of them have been less eager to give me any lessons others have been quite open to it. Lately, I have learned a number of things about negotiating with others and convincing them to agree to my terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8358;Fascinating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8359;I have taken time during the voyage to try to learn what I can from the officals aboard my ship, and though some of them have been less eager to give me any lessons others have been quite open to it. Lately, I have learned a number of things about warfare and grand strategies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8359;Fascinating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8360;I have taken time during the voyage to try to learn what I can from the officals aboard my ship, and though some of them have been less eager to give me any lessons others have been quite open to it. Lately, I have learned a number of things about how to administer a realm in a sensible fashion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8360;Fascinating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8361;I have taken time during the voyage to try to learn what I can from the officals aboard my ship, and though some of them have been less eager to give me any lessons others have been quite open to it. Lately, I have learned a number of things about how to discern useful bits of information from subtle clues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8361;Fascinating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8362;I have taken time during the voyage to try to learn what I can from the officals aboard my ship, and though some of them have been less eager to give me any lessons others have been quite open to it. Lately, I have learned a number of things about history, and how to avoid repeating past mistakes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8362;Fascinating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8363;I want to find the truth, no matter what it might be. During this voyage I have been able to spend a lot of time reading, and I have found it both enjoyable and informative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8363;Books hold many answers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8364;The truth is important, but not everyone cares for the truth. Aboard the Treasure Fleet, there are those that would turn their back on the [Root.TrueReligion.GetName] faith, and thus on the truth. I, however, will not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8364;I trust in [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8365;Today some of the younger sailors aboard my ship asked if I wanted to play with them. They thought we should climb the highest mast together, and maybe swing from some of the ropes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8365;That sounds too scary for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8366;There are many people aboard my ship that I do not know, and I do not want to get to know them if I can avoid it. It sounds exhausting, for one thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8366;Best to avoid them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8367;There are those aboard my ship that seem to be rather full of themselves, even though they do not seem all that impressive. I, on the other hand, have no illusions about myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8367;I am not the best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8368;Some of the people aboard my ship always seem to strive for more. I find that strange, as they already seem to have quite a bit, and I have little interest in being like them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8368;Why should I want more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_8369;There has not been a lot to eat lately as the Treasure Fleet's supplies are dwindling. I seem to have lost a bit of weight, which is a bit concerning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_8369;I'm hungry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
