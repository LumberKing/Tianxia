EVTDESC_SOH_3201;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI hereby request that you gather your warriors and come to my aid, in the name of the Warriors of the Rising Sun. Not doing so would definitely be a sign that you are not a [Root.GetManWoman] of honor.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3201;I will do as you ask!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3201;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3202;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI accept your call to arms as a fellow member of the Warriors of the Rising Sun. We shall fight side by side and prevail in this honorable struggle.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3202;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3203;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI have no intention to support you in your current wars. You should fight your own battles, as that is the honorable thing to do.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3203;You lack both honor and courage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3204;Not long after I send out the call for a worthy commander [invited_lodge_soldier.GetBestName] arrives and offers [invited_lodge_soldier.GetHerHis] services. Hopefully, [invited_lodge_soldier.GetSheHe] will serve me and the Warriors of the Rising Sun with honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3204;I bid you welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3206;A messenger has arrived from [FromFrom.GetBestName], bringing word that [FromFrom.GetSheHe], and thus all Warriors of the Rising Sun, now regard me as dishonorable. It should be evident to everyone that this is not the case, but sadly [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s words tend to carry quite a bit of weight among the Warriors of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3206;I will remember this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3207;A War of the Rising Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3207;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSocietyRank] of the Warriors of the Rising Sun, has proclaimed [From.GetHerHis] intention to launch a grand invasion involving all Warriors of the Rising Sun. [From.GetSheHeCap] has also expressed [From.GetHerHis] desire for other Warriors of the Rising Sun to assist with the preparations if they can.\n\nAt this point, it is uncertain when [From.GetBestName]'s preparations will be completed, and the target is currently unknown, but those near [From.GetHerHis] lands might wish to prepare for the possibility that they are the target.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3207;Worrying...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3207;It will be glorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3208;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI have undertaken several steps to help prepare for the upcoming war so that the Warriors of the Rising Sun may engage in glorious conquest sooner rather than later.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3208;All help is appreciated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3209;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYour assistance with the preparations for the war is certainly appreciated. I look forward to fighting alongside you on the battlefield.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3209;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3210;A War of the Rising Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3210;The promised invasion of the Warriors of the Rising Sun has come at last, quite possibly to the dismay of [rising_sun_subjugation_defender.GetBestName], whose realm is under attack.\n\nAt the command of [rising_sun_grandmaster.GetSocietyRank] [rising_sun_grandmaster.GetFirstName], the armies of the Rising Sun march forth, seeking to secure the [rising_sun_subjugation_target.GetFullName], with the spoils promised to the warrior that contributes the most. [rising_sun_grandmaster.GetBestName] is confident that [rising_sun_grandmaster.GetHerHis] forces will prevail, though perhaps that is because [rising_sun_grandmaster.GetSheHe] would be regarded as a poor warrior if they do not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3210;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3210;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3211;The time has come to take up arms and march against [rising_sun_subjugation_defender.GetBestName]. [rising_sun_grandmaster.GetBestName], the [rising_sun_grandmaster.GetSocietyRank] of the Warriors of the Rising Sun has let it be known that the [rising_sun_subjugation_target.GetFullName] will be granted to the warrior that contributes the most.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3211;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3213;With the death of [From.GetBestName] the invasion of the Warriors of the Rising Sun has been indefinitely postponed. Perhaps [From.GetHerHis] successor will make another attempt, but whether that will be the case is unknown as of yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3213;So much for that invasion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3213;How unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3214;With the last of my ongoing wars coming to an end the band of ronin that has been fighting for me has taken its leave, looking for other opportunities elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3214;As is their right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
