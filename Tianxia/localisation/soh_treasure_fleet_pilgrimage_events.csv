EVTTITLE_SOH_9022;The Holy City of Jerusalem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9022;You have finally arrived at Jerusalem! Passing by the Mount of Olives, you enter through the city gate and are immediately overcome by a feeling of having made a truly epic journey. The city is filled with people of all creeds and colors, the air heavy with smells of strange spices and foreign plants. You make your way through the throng of people and animals, excited by the knowledge that you are now close to the Via Dolorosa and the other holy places. You plan to also visit the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, but first of all you need to find someplace to stay. After all, you wouldn't want to be forced to sleep in a stable, would you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9022;No time to waste!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9023;Axum At Last;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9023;You have finally arrived at Aksum! This is one of the oldest centers of the Christian faith, and it is here that the Ark of the Covenant is kept, guarded by monks inside the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion. Though no longer the great city it once was, Aksum is still an important center of pilgrimage, and you can see many travellers in the streets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9023;No time to waste!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9024;The Holy City of Mecca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9024;I have finally arrived at the holy city of Mecca, the destination of the Hajj. The number of other pilgrims travelling towards the city along the same route has been growing with each passing day, which is unsurprising as it is the duty of every Muslim to visit the city at least once during their life. I will need to make good use of my time here, seeing as I will need to return to the Treasure Fleet sooner rather than later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9024;No time to waste!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9025;Approaching Girnar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9025;You have arrived in the temple district of Taleti at the foot of Girnar. A long set of stairs will take you up the sacred mountain to see the shrines and temples. It was here that Krishna was once confined by his mother and where he tricked Kalayavana to meet the inflaming ire of the sleeping Muchukunda.\n\nAs you reach the Bhavnat shrine you observe the hundreds of naked Sadhus making their offerings to Shiva and bathing themselves in the tank of the temple. The entire place is resounding with sounds and music and according to some Shiva himself is near.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9025;No time to waste!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9026;The Beauty of Bulguksa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9026;I have arrived at the foot of the mountain known as Dongak, the East Big Mountain. On its slopes, Bulguksa Temple and the Seokguram Grotto can be found, both of them holy places without compare in the Korean Peninsula.\n\nI am certainly not the only pilgrim here, and I am certainly not alone in feeling awed by the sight of the mountain and the temple above me. Within its walls, I can doubtlessly find monks and scholars and other notable people from both near and far, and I can probably find some in the grotto too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9026;No time to waste!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9027;Approaching Mount Koya;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9027;After a long journey I have arrived at Mount Koya. The sacred monastery is located between the mountain's eight peaks, making it appear almost as if it is situated in a lotus plant, and the sight is impressive even at a distance.\n\nThough the whole area is sacred and many of the people here might be interesting to talk to, the sheer size of the place is such that it is unlikely that I will be able to find the time to look everywhere for something specific.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9027;No time to waste!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9028;The Shrines of Shikoku;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9028;I have finally arrived in Shikoku, where the many shrines I plan to visit during my pilgrimage can be found.\n\nUnlike most other pilgrimages, which tend to involve visiting one or a few holy sites located closely together, the Shikoku pilgrimage involves walking around the whole island, following a symbolic path to enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9028;No time to waste!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9029;Shravanabeagola Sighted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9029;You have finally arrived in Shravanabelagola, the white pond of the Shravana. For centuries great monks and Sravakas have meditated here on the hills of Chandragiri and Vindhyagiri, among them even great kings and emperors. As you approach the main pond you reflect on the faith of Bahubali whose atonement for his sins and sublimation into godhood is commemorated here by a fifty-seven feet statue in his likeness. Shravanabelagola is the site of many Jain mathas and temples and is the site where some of the holiest scriptures are kept.\n\nFortunately you have arrived in time for the Mahamastakabhisheka ceremony and get to watch as the statue of Bahubali is bathed and anointed and sprinkled with powders of Sandalwood and Vermilion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9029;No time to waste!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9030;Approaching Girnar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9030;You have arrived in the temple district of Taleti at the foot of Girnar. A long set of stairs will take you up the sacred mountain to see the shrines and temples.

EVTTITLE_SOH_9031;Shikarji Sighted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9031;Having crossed the Madhuban forest, you have finally reached the foot of the Parasnath hills and the pilgrimage of Shikarji. On these mountain peaks twenty out of the twenty-four tirthankaras achieved moksha through meditation making this one of the holiest of places in the world. Their ascent to Nirvana has left a permanent mark on this place, and during your climb upwards to the sacred peaks you pass the small marble tonks left to commemorate each and every one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9031;No time to waste!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9032;Arriving at Kumano;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9032;I have arrived at the start of the Kumano pilgrim route, along which a number of important shrines can be found, and though I have decided not to visit the grand shrine at Ise this time I will definitely visit quite a few shrines.\n\nRegardless of who or what I might find along the pilgrim route, I must be prepared to keep on walking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9032;No time to waste!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9033;Approaching Ise;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9033;At last I have arrived at Ise, the site of the ancient and massive shrine complex known as Ise Grand Shrine, which primarily is dedicated to Amaterasu-Omikami, the great august kami who shines in the heaven. It is one of the holiest and most important sites of the Shinto religion, and I am far from the only pilgrim present.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9033;No time to waste!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9093;I have met so many fascinating people during my pilgrimage, and my faith has not been this strong in many years. Unfortunately, it is time for me to return to the Treasure Fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9093;If only I could stay longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9094;I meet all kinds of people during the pilgrimage, some of them taking it rather more seriously than others. My faith is tested at times, but rewarded at others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9094;It could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9095;I have a truly miserable time during my pilgrimage, and am quite happy to be departing for the Treasure Fleet again. Truly, being a "good" [Root.Religion.GetName] is not worthwhile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9095;What a waste of time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9096;Only a few ships from the Treasure Fleet are still left in the harbour by the time that I return, with their captains impatient to join those further out at sea. I am not the last to return, but I clearly cut things rather close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9096;Just in time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
