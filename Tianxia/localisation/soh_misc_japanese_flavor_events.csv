EVTDESC_SOH_7503;Word has arrived that a strange woman has arrived nearby recently. The rumors I have had are quite contradictory, but they all seem to agree that she has highly unusual hair, and most of the rumors claim that she might be from the Moon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7503;I will check this out myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7503;This can't be important...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7504;I have arrived in the area where the woman with the strange hair supposedly can be found, and I have no difficulty locating her. Her hair truly is unusual, seeing as it is pink of all things. Introducing herself as Kaguya, the woman claims that she is in the area because she has received a message that some people might need help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7504;Let me know if I can be of assistance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7504;I don't have time for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7505;I have just received a message from the pink-haired woman known as Kaguya. She informs me that she has been able to determine that the people she was there to assist can be found elsewhere, and as such she will be departing from the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7505;Safe voyage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7506;I have just received a message from the pink-haired woman known as Kaguya. She claims that she will need access to various rare materials in order to be able to help the people that requested her assistance, and she is wondering whether I might be able to provide those materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7506;I can provide the money for them, at least!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7506;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7507;I have received another message from Kaguya, the strange pink-haired woman I met before. She regrets to inform me that she was unable to find the supplies she needed in the area and will be looking for them elsewhere. The messenger that delivered the message claims that the woman that gave it to him flew off in a strange iron contraption.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7507;What?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7508;Kaguya, the strange pink-haired woman I met before, requests that I come visit her again. When I arrive she hands me a large book, telling me that it is payment for services rendered. The book turns out to contain highly advanced knowledge, some of which might explain the strange iron contraption I saw flying off as I was departing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7508;This... this changes everything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
