EVTDESC_GRACE_991;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nThe [From.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [From.GetTitledName] no longer considers the Peace Deal between our realms to be in its interest. Surely you cannot fault our reasoning.\n\nSigned,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GRACE_991;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] dares break our agreement?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GRACE_992;[Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI thought the Dragon Throne could be trusted, but it is evident that the Middle Kingdom is ruled by a liar and a thief. I will remember this betrayal of trust.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GRACE_992;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GRACE_993;[Root.GetTitledName],\n\nOur Peace Deal is no longer in my interest. Surely you will understand that I end it prematurely.\nSigned,\n\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GRACE_993;The Dragon Throne will remember this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GRACE_994;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nThe [From.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [From.GetTitledName]'s memory is long, and barbarians who turn their backs on its mercy will be taught the price of their folly when the time is right.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GRACE_994;I hope it was worth it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_GRACE_339;An Imperial Marriage?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GRACE_339;Your ministers inform you that [FromFrom.GetTitledName] has sent an envoy asking for an Imperial Marriage between [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] and [From.GetBestName] as [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has earned enough Grace to request this Boon.\n\nRefusing the Boon without a good reason would be a widely unpopular move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GRACE_339;Of course we will agree to this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GRACE_339;I have other plans for her...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_GRACE_339;[FromFromFrom.GetBestName] does not deserve an Imperial Marriage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_GRACE_339;The Dragon Throne refuses, because I said so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GRACE_340;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nThe [From.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [From.GetTitledName] has agreed to an Imperial Marriage between [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName] and [dragon_bride.GetFullName].\n\nIn addition to sending the bride-to-be, [From.GetTitledName] has agreed to a Peace Deal between the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], lasting for fifty years or until the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty no longer sits on the Dragon Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GRACE_340;May the union be fruitful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GRACE_341;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nThe [From.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [From.GetTitledName] is unfortunately unable to agree to the marriage you asked for on behalf of [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName] at this time. [From.GetBestName] has, however, agreed to refund the Grace the request cost you, and will of course consider future Boon requests from you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GRACE_341;I suppose we could try again later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GRACE_342;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nThe [From.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [From.GetTitledName] will not send an Imperial Princess to marry a barbarian like [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName], as he is unworthy of such an honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GRACE_342;I will not forget this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_GRACE_980;The Dragon Throne dislikes you, for one reason or another, and is unlikely to grant you Boons or to accept Tributes from you. Perhaps this will pass over time, or perhaps their dislike knows no bounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_GRACE_980;The Dragon Throne seems to have a neutral, or even positive, opinion of you, but keep in mind that if they desire your land some Boons and Tributes might be unavailable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GRACE_980;Let's not anger them further...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GRACE_980;Sounds good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_KOWTOW_1;A Guest for Dinner?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KOWTOW_1;Word has reached you that [From.GetTitledName] is currently travelling through [Root.Capital.GetName]. Supposedly, [From.GetSheHe] is on [From.GetHerHis] way to China to kowtow before the Dragon Throne. Without doubt, [From.GetSheHe] would enjoy your hospitality, should you wish to extend it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KOWTOW_1;Ask them to come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KOWTOW_1;Ask them to come... to their death!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_KOWTOW_1;Let's not invite them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_KOWTOW_3;As dinner is brought to the table, your servants bring out a goblet filled with the 'special' wine you asked them to fetch for [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and place it in front of them. [FromFrom.GetTitledName] drinks deeply, and the meal progresses for a while without incident. However, just as you start to suspect that [FromFrom.GetTitledName] must have taken an antidote, they suddenly start coughing and clearly have trouble breathing.\n'You will not get away with this!' they manage to say before expiring.\nSmiling, you wave a servant over to your side as the body of [FromFrom.GetTitledName] is being dragged away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_KOWTOW_3;As dinner is brought to the table, your servants bring out a goblet filled with the 'special' wine you asked them to fetch for [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and place it in front of them. [FromFrom.GetTitledName] drinks deeply, then lets out a sigh.\n'You know, in the [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetName], wine tastes a bit differently than this, most of the time,' they say, meeting your eyes and smiling ever so slightly. 'We also tend to see it as a breach of hospitality if a host tries to poison their guests.'\nEvidently, [FromFrom.GetTitledName] has taken an antidote to the poison you used beforehand, and as they reach for their sword you realize that things might be getting out of hand very rapidly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_KOWTOW_3;As dinner is brought to the table, your servants bring out a goblet filled with the 'special' wine you asked them to fetch for [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and place it in front of them. However, to your surprise, [FromFrom.GetTitledName] has brought some wine of their own and seems perfectly content to drink from it instead of the poisoned goblet in front of them.\n'I hope you do not mind,' they say, drinking deeply, 'but I have always preferred the wine from home.'\nYou cannot tell if they suspect that you attempted to poison them or if they just got lucky, but it would seem that the plan is doomed to failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KOWTOW_3;I think I will celebrate... with beer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KOWTOW_3;Guards! To me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_KOWTOW_3;Are you sure you don't want to try my wine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_KOWTOW_4;A Local Vintage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_KOWTOW_4;As evening arrives, [From.GetTitledName]'s servants have prepared a magnificient meal for you and [From.GetTitledName] to share.\nAs you previously have noticed that the wine you have found in foreign lands is surprisingly good, you gracefully accept [From.GetTitledName]'s offer of a goblet of what supposedly is 'the finest wine in all the world'. As you take the first sip, you notice a strance, almost unnoticeable taste of something unknown. You put it out of your mind and keep drinking, and the meal progresses.\nHowever, by the time the dinner is nearing its end, you start to cough, and as you look over at [From.GetTitledName] you can see them smiling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_KOWTOW_4;As evening arrives, [From.GetTitledName]'s servants have prepared a magnificient meal for you and [From.GetTitledName] to share.\nAs you previously have noticed that the wine you have found in foreign lands is surprisingly good, you gracefully accept [From.GetTitledName]'s offer of a goblet of what supposedly is 'the finest wine in all the world'. As you take the first sip, you notice the slight, but unmistakable, taste of poison. Safe in the knowledge that you took an antidote before the meal, you drink deeply and consider your options.\nYou could try to kill [From.GetTitledName], even though their guards probably will aid them, or you could try to run away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_KOWTOW_4;As evening arrives, [From.GetTitledName]'s servants have prepared a magnificient meal for you and [From.GetTitledName] to share.\nAs you previously have noticed that the wine you have found in foreign lands is less to your liking than that from home, you gracefully decline [From.GetTitledName]'s offer of a goblet of what supposedly is 'the finest wine in all the world'. For some reason, this seems to be making [From.GetTitledName] somewhat more unhappy than would be expected, but aside from repeatedly asking you if you want to try the wine nothing comes from your refusal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KOWTOW_4;Poison! No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KOWTOW_4;Time to kill!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_KOWTOW_4;Time to run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_KOWTOW_4;I don't need it, thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_KOWTOW_5;Just before dinner is about to begin, [FromFrom.GetTitledName] excuses themselves to head to the privy. You patiently await their return, but eventually it seems clear that they are going to be missing for a while, so you and the others present start eating.\nThe meal tastes differently from what you would expect. At first, you think that the servants have been trying something new with the spices. Then, as you start feeling unwell, you wonder if perhaps the ingredients have spoiled. However, none of the others present seem to be noticing anything unusual.\nAs pain erupts in your stomach and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] still is nowhere to be seen, you realize that you have been poisoned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_KOWTOW_5;As your servants arrive with dinner, [FromFrom.GetTitledName] rises from the table in a hurry, almost knocking over their goblet. 'I need to visit the privy,' they hurriedly explain, rushing towards the doors.\nAs you are quite hungry already, you start your meal, but as soon as you swallow it you feel pain rapidly spreading throughout your entire body. Looking over towards [FromFrom.GetTitledName], you see them trying to push past the captain of your bodyguard, and you suddenly understand that you have been poisoned.\nBefore everything goes black, you have the satisfaction of seeing [FromFrom.GetTitledName] get cut down by your bodyguards, along with the servants and guards they had brought with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_KOWTOW_5;Shortly before dinner is about to begin, the commander of your bodyguard requests a meeting in private. As you trust him fully, you grant the request, and his men drag in a corpse dressed in the livery of the [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetName].\n'We caught this man trying to poison your meal, my [Root.GetLordLady],' one of your bodyguards tell you when you inquire about the corpse. 'It seems clear that [FromFrom.GetTitledName] intended to betray your hospitality. What are your orders?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KOWTOW_5;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KOWTOW_5;At least they did not survive either!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_KOWTOW_5;Wipe them out! All of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_KOWTOW_6;A New Friend;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KOWTOW_6;You and [From.GetTitledName] quickly discover that you have a lot in common, and you stay up long into the night conversing on a variety of topics. By the time they depart, it is clear that this is a friendship that will last for some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KOWTOW_6;Friends forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_KOWTOW_7;An Uneventful Evening;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KOWTOW_7;The meal you and [From.GetTitledName] share is better than the company, you soon realize, and though you do what you can to be a gracious host you almost feel like letting out a sigh in relief as [From.GetTitledName]'s party departs the next morning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KOWTOW_7;Well, that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_KOWTOW_8;A Shadow in the Night;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KOWTOW_8;[From.GetTitledName] suddenly turns around and cuts down one of your guards, sprinting away from the table as their guards and servants quickly arm themselves to fight your remaining guards as they close in. You shout for your men to make sure [From.GetTitledName] cannot reach their horse, but in the confusion it is not clear if you are heard.\nAs the fighting dies down, several of your guards and servants are dead, as well as the guards and servants left behind by [From.GetTitledName], and you are informed by your remaining guards that [From.GetTitledName] and a small party have managed to escape. Even worse, they set your horses loose as well, and it is clear that any pursuit is doomed to failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KOWTOW_8;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_KOWTOW_9;A Shadow in the Night;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_KOWTOW_9;You quickly spin around and cut down one of the guards before [FromFrom.GetTitledName] can react, running from the table as you hear the guards and servants you left behind draw their weapons to fight [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s guards.\nIn the confusion, you manage to avoid [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s guards without any danger and make your way to your horse alongside a small party of your guards and servants that also have escaped from the fighting. With no time to waste, you ride off, having your guards set [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s horses free as you escape in the hopes of slowing down any pursuit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_KOWTOW_9;You quickly spin around and cut down one of the guards before [FromFrom.GetTitledName] can react, running from the table as you hear the guards and servants you left behind draw their weapons to fight [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s guards.\nIn the confusion, you manage to fight your way past [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s guards, wounded but alive, and make your way to your horse alongside a small party of your guards and servants that also have escaped from the fighting. With no time to waste, you ride off, having your guards set [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s horses free as you escape in the hopes of slowing down any pursuit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KOWTOW_9;At least I got away unharmed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KOWTOW_9;This could have gone better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_KOWTOW_10;An Arrow in the Night;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KOWTOW_10;[From.GetTitledName] suddenly turns around and cuts down one of your guards, sprinting away from the table as their guards and servants quickly arm themselves to fight your remaining guards as they close in. You shout for your men to make sure [From.GetTitledName] cannot reach their horse, but in the confusion it is not clear if you are heard.\nAs the fighting dies down, several of your guards and servants are dead, as well as the guards and servants left behind by [From.GetTitledName], but some of your remaining guards bring in [From.GetTitledName]'s corpse with an arrow sticking out of it. Despite things not going quite as planned, it would seem you have successfully killed [From.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KOWTOW_10;That went well, in the end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_KOWTOW_11;An Arrow in the Night;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KOWTOW_11;You quickly spin around and cut down one of the guards before [FromFrom.GetTitledName] can react, running from the table as you hear the guards and servants you left behind draw their weapons to fight [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s guards.\nIn the confusion, you manage to avoid [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s guards without any danger and hurriedly move towards your horse longside a small party of your guards and servants that also have escaped from the fighting. Just as you are about to mount up, an arrow comes flying out of the dark, striking you in the chest, and the last thing you see before everything goes dark is more arrows striking the rest of your party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KOWTOW_11;No! I was so close...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_KOWTOW_12;Trechery's Reward;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KOWTOW_12;You expect [From.GetTitledName] to try to cut their way to their horse, but it becomes clear that that is not what they have in mind as they move towards you. You quickly pull free your own sword and call out for your guards as [From.GetTitledName]'s guards and servants also rise to their feet with weapons drawn.\nEven though you should have the advantage due to sheer numbers, the fight turns against you, and [From.GetTitledName] manages to disarm you. Before you can get another weapon into your hand, they thrust their sword into your throat, and your vision starts to fade even before they turn around to escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KOWTOW_12;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_KOWTOW_13;Trechery's Reward;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KOWTOW_13;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] clearly was expecting you to try to run away, as they almost don't have the time to pull free their sword before you are upon them. As your blades meet, you are vaguely aware that your guards and servants are doing what they can to fight off [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s guards that have arrived.\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName] should have the advantage due to the sheer number of guards they have nearby, but the fight still turns in your favor, and you disarm [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and quickly strike them down before they can grab another weapon. Taking in the situation around you, it is clear that you will be able to escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KOWTOW_13;Thus is trechery rewarded!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_KOWTOW_14;An Uneven Fight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KOWTOW_14;You expect [From.GetTitledName] to try to cut their way to their horse, but it becomes clear that that is not what they have in mind as they move towards you. You quickly pull free your own sword and call out for your guards as [From.GetTitledName]'s guards and servants also rise to their feet with weapons drawn.\nYou have the advantage due to sheer numbers, and the fight turns against [From.GetTitledName] and their guards. You disarm them before long, and before they can react you thrust your sword into their throat as your guards continue to cut down the rest of [From.GetTitledName]'s party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KOWTOW_14;Make sure they are truly dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_KOWTOW_15;An Uneven Fight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KOWTOW_15;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] clearly was expecting you to try to run away, as they almost don't have the time to pull free their sword before you are upon them. As your blades meet, you are vaguely aware that your guards and servants are doing what they can to fight off [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s guards that have arrived.\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName] has the advantage due to the sheer number of guards they have nearby, and the fight quickly turns against you and your beleagued party. Before long, you are disarmed, and [FromFrom.GetTitledName], and they quickly strikes you down before you can grab another weapon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KOWTOW_15;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KOWTOW_16;The rider you sent to invite [From.GetTitledName] returns before long, informing you that [From.GetTitledName] and their party will not be joining you for dinner as they wish to travel quickly to reach their destination as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KOWTOW_16;That's unfortunate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_KOWTOW_18;A Visitor from Afar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_KOWTOW_18;[From.GetTitledName] has arrived at your court, supposedly to kowtow before the Dragon Throne. As you do not like them, meeting them in person is obviously out of the question, and perhaps this is an opportunity for retribution...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_KOWTOW_18;[From.GetTitledName] has arrived at your court, supposedly to kowtow before the Dragon Throne. However, even for a barbarian they have been unusually disruptive at court, and perhaps they should not be allowed into your presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_KOWTOW_18;[From.GetTitledName] has arrived at your court, supposedly to kowtow before the Dragon Throne. While they are not fitting in as well as some might like, they are not being as disruptive as some barbarians have been in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_KOWTOW_18;[From.GetTitledName] has arrived at your court, supposedly to kowtow before the Dragon Throne. Even though they are a barbarian, they are behaving almost as well as if they have been raised in the Middle Kingdom, and your ministers are most impressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KOWTOW_18;Let them kowtow before a depiction of me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KOWTOW_18;They can kowtow before me, but quickly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_KOWTOW_18;They can kowtow before me, as I am impressed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_KOWTOW_18;Have them escorted to the dungeon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_KOWTOW_19;The Dragon's Wrath;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KOWTOW_19;As you wait for the ministers at [From.GetTitledName]'s court to arrange for you to kowtow before the Dragon Throne, a number of guards come rushing in and surround your party. Before long, you are all escorted down to the dungeons to await your fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KOWTOW_19;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_1;[From.GetTitledName] has agreed to your request to turn over [From.escaped_chinese_noble.GetName], and they have been imprisoned to await punushment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JDEXTRA_1;Good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2;[From.GetTitledName] has refused your request to turn over [From.escaped_chinese_noble.GetName]. Evidently, they do not respect the Dragon Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JDEXTRA_2;I will remember this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JDEXTRA_2;Assassinate [From.escaped_chinese_noble.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_3;[From.escaped_chinese_noble.GetName], an escaped convict, has apparently showed up in [From.GetTitledName]'s court, and [From.GetTitledName] has agreed to hand them over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JDEXTRA_3;Dispatch some soldiers to arrest them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_4;You have learned that [From.escaped_chinese_noble.GetName] somehow managed to escape from [From.GetTitledName]'s court before your soldiers arrived. Clearly, [From.GetTitledName] cannot be trusted not to waste your time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JDEXTRA_4;[From.GetTitledName] disappoints me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_JDEXTRA_6;A Diplomatic Mission?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_6;It is only proper that foreign barbarians treat the envoys of the [Root.GetChinaShortName] Empire respectfully. Do you want to send an envoy to [chinese_envoy_target.GetTitledName] to see if they respect the Dragon Throne?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JDEXTRA_6;Let's send an envoy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JDEXTRA_6;This can wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_JDEXTRA_7;An Envoy Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_7;It would seem [From.GetTitledName] does not respect the Middle Kingdom. [From.GetSheHeCap] went so far as to refuse to see your envoy, which is a major sign of disrespect towards the Dragon Throne itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JDEXTRA_7;How barbaric!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_JDEXTRA_8;Proper Respect;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_8;While [From.GetSheHe] still is a foreign barbarian, [From.GetTitledName] has shown your envoys great respect during their visit to [From.GetHerHis] court, and by extension [From.GetSheHe] clearly respects the Dragon Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JDEXTRA_8;Civilized barbarians?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_JDEXTRA_9;No Respect;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_9;While [From.GetTitledName] welcomed your envoys, [From.GetSheHe] still is a foreign barbarian, and [From.GetHerHis] respect towards your envoys was lacking. By extension, [From.GetTitledName] disrespects the Dragon Throne itself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JDEXTRA_9;How barbaric!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_JDEXTA_40000;A Trade Competition?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_40000;That barbarians from faraway lands want to trade with the Middle Kingdom is well known. However, though most of them deserve no special treatment, occassionally one of them are worthy of better treatment. Should we let some of them compete for this right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JDEXTRA_40000;Let's hold a trade competition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JDEXTRA_40000;This seems unnecessary...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_JDEXTRA_40004;A New City;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_40004;[From.GetTitledName] has had a new city constructed along the Silk Road to prove that they are worthy of more favorable trade deals with the Middle Kingdom. It is undeniable that they have done well, and we should reward them accordingly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JDEXTRA_40004;Let them know that I am pleased!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_JDEXTRA_40006;Disappointment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_40006;Despite the honor of being allowed to prove themselves worthy of being granted favorable trade deals with the Middle Kingdom, none of the barbarians given this honor have lived up to expectations, and it is clear they should not be granted any rewards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JDEXTRA_40006;Let them know I am displeased!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JDEXTRA_70004;Gold is certainly nice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_70007;[From.escaped_chinese_noble.GetName], an escaped convict, has apparently showed up in [From.GetTitledName]'s court, and [From.GetTitledName] has not seen fit to inform you of this, unlike what might be expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
