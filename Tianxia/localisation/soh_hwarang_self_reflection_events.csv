EVTDESC_SOH_2060;One of the advantages of being a member of the Hwarang is that there are always someone around to ask for assistance, and as such it was not too much trouble for me to find someone that could help me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2060;Together, we can achieve anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2061;I visited a temple as planned to seek assitance from the people there, and I got some advice that certainly will help me be more trusting. Moreover, I felt as if the people at the temple really appreciated my visit and my attempt to better myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2061;Time well spent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2062;I visited a temple as planned for some help with my self-reflection. I felt very welcome there, and though the visit did not really result in any progress it did not feel as if it was a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2062;I got a few good tips, at least...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_2064;My visit to a temple for help with my self-reflection was very uneventful. None of those there had any useful tips to give me, and though I did not feel unwelcome I feel as if it was not time well spent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2064;That didn't help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2065;I felt most unwelcome when I visited a temple for some help with my self-reflection. None of those there could offer me any useful tips, and some of them even seemed to be displeased to see me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2065;I expected so much more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2067;I have been attempting to become more trusting for a while now, but I have not succeeded in reaching my goal yet. It is possible I am wasting my time, but also possible I can succeed if I keep on trying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2067;I will keep trying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2067;This is going nowhere...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2068;My attempt to become trusting has been successful. Without doubt, the Hwarang will approve of this, and I am convinced it is a change for the better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2068;I have reached my goal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2069;I am trying to become zealous to be a better member of the Hwarang, and though it might take me several tries to improve in that regard I need to figure out how I want to approach the matter for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2069;I will meditate on the matter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_2069;I will speak to [hwarang_self_reflection_help.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_2069;I will request help from the Hwarang!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_2069;I will visit a temple for assistance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2070;I have spent several days meditating on how to better myself, questioning why I have struggled with being zealous in the past. Initially I did not expect much, but as I kept meditating I discovered things about myself I did not know before, and I have definitely made significant progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2070;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2071;I have spent several days meditating on how to better myself, and though I do not feel I have made any significant progress I feel that it has been a worthwhile experience, and possibly something that might help me in the right direction in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2071;That wasn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_2073;I expected more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2074;I have spent several days meditating on how to better myself, but as I kept meditating I started questioning why I am trying to change myself and whether I am simply trying to please others at the expense of being true to myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2074;Is this a mistake?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_2076;[From.GetBestName], a friend and a fellow member of the Hwarang, has asked me for some tips on how to be more zealous, as [From.GetSheHe] wishes to improve in that regard to be a better person and a better member of the Hwarang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_2076;I will give [From.GetHerHim] some useful tips;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_2077;[From.GetBestName] gave me quite a few tips regarding how I could think to be more zealous, and it did not take me long to figure out how they were applicable for me in particular. I have definitely made some noticeable progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
