EVTTITLE_SOH_9502;The Empty Coast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9502;After many, many weeks at sea with only a few deserted islands being encountered the Treasure Fleet has finally sighted a substantial landmass, and the order has come to head towards it as quickly as possible so that everyone can step ashore for a while.\n\nStrangely enough, the coast also appears to be completely devoid of settlements or even signs of human life, even though it seems impossible that such a large landmass would not be populated. Perhaps there are civilizations found elsewhere in this strange land?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9502;Maybe further south?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9503;Making Landfall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9503;The Treasure Fleet has been following the coast for over a week now, and there is still no sign of human life. The matter has been discussed aboard most of the ships, but none have come up with a good reason for why this land is so empty.\n\nEventually, the order is given for the fleet to anchor just off the coast, and an expedition is readied to head further inland. I am among those chosen to take part in this expedition, as are plenty of other notables from the fleet. Just what we will find is uncertain, but hopefully it will be interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9503;We head inland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9504;Lines in the Sand;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9504;The expedition from the Treasure Fleet has been moving inland for a number of days when the first signs of human civilization are encountered. The desert we have been walking into appears to have several straight lines carved across it, as well as some that perhaps make out some kind of figures, though just what they might depict is currently unknown.\n\nAfter discussing the matter for a while, it is decided that the expedition will continue into the nearby mountains, as it should be possible to see just what the strange shapes are from up there, possibly along with other signs of civilization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9504;To the mountains!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9506;The Pictures Below;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9506;Having made our way up the sides of the nearby mountains, it is possible to make out just what the figures below are supposed to be. I can see some kind of fish, a spider, a monkey, and several other things besides.\n\nJust who made these symbols remains a mystery, however, and as we cannot see any other signs of human civilization regardless of which direction we look in it is decided that it is time to leave this strange, empty land with all due haste, as exploration is not really the Treasure Fleet's mission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9506;Pretty, but useless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9507;The expedition's return to the Treasure Fleet is uneventful, and I find myself somewhat disappointed in what we have found in this strange land. The figures in the sand were interesting to look at, to be sure, but if we had met some people it would surely have been more beneficial to the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9507;I suppose we head back to Java now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9509;The Pictures Below;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9509;Having made yur way up the sides of the nearby mountains, it is possible to make out just what the figures below are supposed to be. I can see some kind of fish, a spider, a monkey, and several other things besides.\n\nAs I and the others are discussing just who might have made these symbols and the lines surrounding them a large number of warriors suddenly appear and surround us. Though their weapons are primitive, there is quite a few of them, and their suggestion that we should come with them seems quite reasonable compared to the alternative...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9509;Take us to your leader!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9510;The Journey Inland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9510;Initially it seemed as if the strangers' city was not too distant, based on the way they phrased their request for us to come with them, but we have been travelling for quite some time and have passed through several substantial towns without stopping for longer than a night's rest.\n\nSome of those from the Treasure Fleet seem rather impatient to get to our destination, muttering that we have been gone for too long already, but it is becoming clearer and clearer that we are outnumbered in this place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9510;We're being treated well, at least...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9512;The City of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9512;We have been travelling with the warriors for weeks by the time we finally reach our destination, and though they have spoken at length about what we would see when we arrived I am still awestruck by the sight, as are many others.\n\nSituated high in the mountains, the capital city of this unknown civilization rivals the greatest cities of the Middle Kingdom in size, and even at a distance I can make what has to be the "Golden Temple" yur guides have spoken about, as well as a large number of palaces surrounding a central square that surely has to be large enough for a small army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9512;It truly is a majestic sight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9513;The Lord of the Dawn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9513;We are marched straight through the city and past the gawking crowds to one of the many palaces and brought before the ruler of this strange empire. He inquires as to where we have come from and seems satisfied when he hears that we have come across the "Great Western Ocean".\n\nDiscussing the matter with some people that appear to be his advisors, he eventually tells me and the others that he needs to see to some matters concerning the fight against the "Obsidian Empire", before giving the order to arrange for some houses for his honored guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9513;Guests? I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9515;I have spent the last several days walking through the city - Cuzco, I have been told - and speaking to its people, trying to learn more about the empire we are in. It seems it is sometimes referred to as the "Burning Empire", and that it has been growing rapidly the past few generations, adding four grand provinces to its previous four.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9515;And yet they seem hungry for more land...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9516;Today I saw a large detachment of warriors and an even larger number of men carrying large quantities of supplies preparing to leave the city, apparently about to head west. While we passed quite a few towns on the way here, the area seemed quite peaceful, so this was rather strange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9516;Where are they going...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9517;One evening in Cuzco I notice someone moving in the darkness outside the building where I am staying and head to investigate it. I find a young woman outside, who begs me to help her hide as the guards are looking for her. She claims she is due to be sacrificed to the sun god Inti.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9517;I'll help you hide!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9517;I will tell them you went the other way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9517;Guards! She's here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9518;I help the young woman inside and start looking for a place for her to hide. Before we find a good hiding spot I hear a great smashing sound behind us, and turn around to see the guards forcing their way inside. Their leader orders one of his men to kill me and the woman where we stand due to the grave sacrilege we have committed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9518;The Dragon will not forgive this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9519;I help the young woman inside and she hides out of sight while we wait to see if the guards are comming. They do not, and we find the time to relax. The young woman tells me she has been living a secluded life and that she has never known the touch of a [Root.GetManWoman]. Perhaps, she suggests, we could change that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9519;Certainly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9519;I'm sorry, but we can only be friends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9519;You and me? I can do better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9520;I help the young woman inside and she hides out of sight while we wait to see if the guards are comming. They do not, and we find the time to relax. We start asking one another about each other, and she seems to find me quite fascinating, much like I find her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9520;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9520;It's just a short diversion...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9521;One of the stranger things I have noticed in the strange city of Cuzco is that there are no carts anywhere. It seems as if the inhabitants have not bothered to invent the wheel, even though that surely is one of the most useful inventions in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9521;I'll show them what a wheel is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9522;I manage to convince some of the locals to help me with my project and set to work, having them create a fairly ordinary cart that still should get the point across. Though it works as well as I had expected it to, the locals seem unconvinced that it will be at all useful, and they dismantle the cart to use the wood elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9522;Savages!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9523;I spend some time discussing matters of warfare with some of the more talkative soldiers in the City of the Sun, and they are eager to tell me more about the protracted conflict against the Obsidian Empire in the far north. Apparently their foes wear human skin and bathe in the blood of innumerable human sacrifices to their dark gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9523;They sound like terrifying foes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9524;While Cuzco and the Burning Empire as a whole seem prosperous and stable at this time, it seems like that was not the case recently. The Lord of the Dawn apparently had to fight to keep his throne when a cousin of his tried to claim it a decade back, in a war that threatened the survival of the Burning Empire as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9524;But that weakness is no more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9525;One day when passing through one of the many temples of Inti in Cuzco I notice that there is a small golden idol standing on a pedestal off to one side. It seems to be unguarded, at least for the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9525;It must be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9525;It's pretty, I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9526;I take a look around to be sure that I am not being watched and move to the idol, quickly grabbing it and hiding it inside my clothes. I sneak out of the temple as a large group of locals enter, making my way back to the house that I have been given and inspecting the idol when I get there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9526;This will be worth quite a bit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9527;I make my way over to the idol and am about to grab it when I catch sight of a guard out of the corner of my eye. I manage to convert my attempt to reach for the idol into an elaborate bow, which seems to satisfy the guard, and then make my way out of the temple in a hurry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9527;Could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9528;I grab the idol and turn around to leave, only then noticing a priest that apparently had come over to speak to me. He notices the idol in my grasp and call out for the guards, and they quickly tie me up and drag me away to be executed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9528;The [treasure_fleet_original_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven will avenge me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9529;I have tried to learn what I can about the locals - the Quechua, or Runa - in this strange land, and it seems their society has three main rules aside from a near fanatical devotion to the Sapa Inca, namely not stealing, not lying, and not being lazy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9529;Obviously stealing is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9529;Lies always do more harm than good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9529;Diligence is never a bad idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_9529;How foolish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_9529;I agree with all those things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9531;One day I and some of the others discover that a party of warriors just arrived, bringing with them a number of prisoners that, based on their clothes, clearly came from the Treasure Fleet. We start putting some things we have learned together, and realize that our host's plans might not be what we thought they were...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9531;We must warn the [treasure_fleet_original_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9532;We make our escape from Cuzco under the cover of night, managing to overwhelm the guards between us and the gates by sheer luck. Barely stopping to rest, we make our way back towards the coast, occasionally spotting what looks like a large war party in pursuit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9532;I think they're gaining on us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9533;As we near the ships the matter of how we are to reclaim the fleet is discussed. We managed to free some of the prisoners in Cuzco, and they have told us what they know about those that seized the fleet, and it sounds as if we will have quite the fight ahead of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9533;We must get aboard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9535;We have reached the ships, and as expected they are heavily guarded. Our soldiers clear a path to the ships, holding the warriors of the Sapa Inca at bay, and the sailors start preparing for departure. The battle does not look good, and perhaps some of us need to join the fight to ensure that at least one ship gets away, come what may...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9535;I will join the fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9535;I will stay on the ship...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9537;I join the battle along with several other officials, and our arrival is enough to stabilize the situation. We beat back several fierce attacks, and then make an orderly retreat back to the ships. Arrows, spears, and stones come flying after us, but most of us escape with our lives, and the remnants of the Treasure Fleet limp away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9537;They will come for us, one day...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9538;I watch from aboard one of the ships as a few brave officials and more of the soldiers disembark again and join the battle. The battle is fierce, but the brave soldiers of the Middle Kingdom hold the line until the fleet is ready and then make an orderly retreat. The remnants of the Treasure Fleet depart for the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9538;They will come for us, one day...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9539;I join the battle alongside several other passengers, attempting to stabilize the situation, but there are too many enemies. We are pushed back and cut down, one brave defender after the other. I hear some of the sailors behind us beg for more time, and we make sure they have it, at the cost of our lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9539;Escape... and prepare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9540;I watch from aboard one of the ships as a few brave officials and more of the soldiers disembark again and join the battle. Their efforts are valiant, and they make sure that the sailors can get a few of the ships underway, at the cost of their lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9540;We must prepare for the worst...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
