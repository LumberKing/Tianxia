EVTDESC_SRI_106;The war is over and lost, but the Sapa Inca is not finished with me. An Apupanaca, an emissary from the imperial city of Cuzco, has been sent to collect one of my daughters, and his eye has fallen on the young [child_to_seize.GetFirstName].\n\n[apupanaca.GetBestName] explains that she will be taken to the Acllahuasi, a sacred convent in Cuzco, and there instructed in the Incan ways. It is a holy place, and [child_to_seize.GetFirstName] might even receive the honor of being sacrificed to Inti when she reaches adulthood. She could also be married to the Sapa Inca, or one of his vassals.\n\nIt is a great honor, and with my levies still recuperating from the defeat at the hands of [From.GetBestName] I am in no position to refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_106;Not my little [child_to_seize.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_106;Her existing betrothal will have to be broken...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_111;An Apupanaca has come all the way from the imperial city of Cuzco, with the sorrowful message that my house has yet to provide a girl to the sacred Acllahuasi. He is here to collect [child_to_seize.GetFirstName].\n\n[apupanaca.GetBestName] explains that she will be taken to a convent in Cuzco, and there instructed in the Yupaychaspa ways. It is a holy place, and [child_to_seize.GetFirstName] might even receive the honor of being sacrificed to Inti when she reaches adulthood. She could also be married to the Sapa Inca, or one of his vassals.\n\nIt is a great honor, and refusing to cooperate would be seen as both foolish and treasonous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_111;Of course you can have her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_111;I suppose her betrothal must be broken...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SRI_111;You are not taking her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SRI_111_TOOLTIP;This may have serious repercussions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SRI_111;How about we forget all about this...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_112;The Apupanaca had left in a hurry, spouting curses upon my house and my cows. Some of those appear to have come true, as I have now been declared an outlaw in the whole Inca realm! The Sapa Inca can imprison me at will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_112;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_113;Tears keep streaming down [child_to_seize.GetFirstName]'s face, no matter how long I or the Apupanaca keep explaining her new status. In the end I give up and pull her in for a long hug, and a few words whispered in her ear where the emissary cannot hear them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_113;Be strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_113;Do it for Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SRI_113;I will bring you home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SRI_113_GET_BACK_DAUGHTER;I will look for opportunities to retrieve [child_to_seize.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_119;It seems [From.GetBestName] is far more set in her [From.Religion.GetName] ways than most, as she keeps refusing to learn how best to serve the Sapa Inca and Inti and claim that [From.Religion.GetHighGodName] will punish me and my "fellow heathens".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_119;She must learn on her own...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_119;I will talk to her about it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SRI_119;If she will not serve, she will die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_120;Word has reached me that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been executed by [From.GetBestName] due to her unwillingness to serve the Sapa Inca and Inti and her continued claims that the Yupaychaspa faith is a false faith worshipped by heathen savages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_120;The savages will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_120;She did not deserve that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SRI_120;She deserved it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_128;[aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName] is living in distant Cuzco with the other Aclla, serving Inti and all the Yupaychaspa faithful. She is without a doubt guarded, but I believe that I might be able to avoid or deal with the guards, and thus it might be a good idea to mount a rescue attempt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_128;I must leave at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_128;I can't do this now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SRI_128;I don't really want her back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_129;I have arrived outside the sacred Acllahuasi. Without doubt, [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName] can be found somewhere inside, but in order to reach her I need to get past the guards you I see patrolling outside. They doubtlessly have orders to keep most people out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_129;I will fight my way past them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_129;They can surely be bribed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SRI_129;I can sneak inside!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SRI_129;I think I will head home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_130;I have returned home from Cuzco, having failed to rescue [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName] from the Acllahuasi. It is possible that I will find another opportunity to do so at some point in the future, but it might also not be possible to do so as the Aclla are heavily guarded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_130;We will have to see what the future holds...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_131;The guards outside the Acllahuasi are taken by surprise by my attack, and many of them fall before they can even attempt to defend themselves. The rest do their best to fight back, but they are no match for a [Root.GetManWoman] like me, and before long they all have fallen before you. The way ahead is clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_131;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_132;The guards outside the Acllahuasi are taken by surprise by my attack, and many of them fall before they can even attempt to defend themselves. The rest do their best to fight back, but they are no match for a [Root.GetManWoman] like me. However, the sound of the fighting has alerted the garrison, and I must withdraw.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_132;I have to leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_133;The guards outside the Acllahuasi are taken by surprise by my attack, and a couple of them fall before they can even attempt to defend themselves.

EVTOPTA_SRI_134;I have to leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_135;The guards outside the Acllahuasi are not particularly surprised by my attack, and they quickly inflict several wounds on me. Eventually I manage to cut the last of them down, but I have taken a grievous wound in the process. At least the way ahead is clear...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SRI_136;I have to leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_137;The guards outside the Acllahuasi are not particularly surprised by my attack, and they fight me to a stalemate easily enough. As I am considering various ways to possibly overpower them one of them sneaks up behind me and throws his arms around me, and the rest of them quickly pile on and bring me down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_137;Not as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_138;I have just learned that [From.GetBestName] sought to enter the sacred Acllahuasi to steal back [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName] but that the guards managed to capture [From.GetHerHim] and have dragged [From.GetHerHim] to a cell, where [From.GetSheHe] will remain until I see fit to release [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_138;[From.GetSheHeCap] deserves no less...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_138;Time to make an example!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_139;A short time after being imprisoned [From.GetBestName] arrives outside my cell accompanied by several guards and [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName]. [From.GetBestName] declares that my sacrilege must be punished before swiftly cutting the throat of [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_139;You will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_140;The guards outside the Acllahuasi are not particularly surprised by my attack, and you take several wounds almost as soon as the fight begins. Though I do my best to fight on, the wounds keep adding up, and several of them are quite bad. It is not long before I am lying on the ground, my vision darkening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_140;And so it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_141;I make my presence known to the commander of the guards outside the Acllahuasi and quickly suggest that it would be in his interests to let me slip past them. I know that the guards have sworn sacred vows to keep the Acllahuasi safe, and the man is a bit hesitant, but once I produce a bag of gold he agrees to not interfere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_141;So much for their sacred vows...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_142;I make my presence known to the commander of the guards outside the Acllahuasi and quickly suggest that it would be in his interests to let me slip past them. Unfortunately, the man seems to be determined to keep his sacred vow to keep the Acllahuasi safe, and he tells me to leave before he has to arrest or kill me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_142;I will fight my way past them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_142;I will return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_143;I make my presence known to the commander of the guards outside the Acllahuasi and quickly suggest that it would be in his interests to let me slip past them. Unfortunately, the man seems to be determined to keep his sacred vow to keep the Acllahuasi safe, and he orders me to surrender to face Inti's justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_143;I will take you all on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_143;I surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_144;I circle around the Acllahuasi and discover what appears to be an unguarded back entrance. I spend some time investigating it to make sure that it is not a trap, before carefully moving closer and making my way inside. I do not encounter any guards inside either, and can progress with my search.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_144;The guards must be lazy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_145;I circle around the Acllahuasi and discover what appears to be an unguarded back entrance. I spend some time investigating it to make sure that it is not a trap, and notice a guard patrol approaching my location. They do not appear to have spotted me yet, but it is only a matter of time before they do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_145;I will fight my way past them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_145;I will return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_146;I circle around the Acllahuasi and discover what appears to be an unguarded back entrance. I spend some time investigating it to make sure that it is not a trap, before carefully moving closer and making my way inside. Just inside the Acllahuasi I encounter a room full of guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_146;I will take you all on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_146;I surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_148;As I search the Acllahuasi for [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName] I hear a voice call out for the guards. Having dealt with the guards previously, none arrive, and I discover that the person that cried out for them was [aclla_rescue_attempt_snitch.GetBestName], who seems quite surprised when I find her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_148;Go away, and stay away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_148;You has made your last mistake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_149;As I search the Acllahuasi for [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName] I hear a voice call out for the guards. I am able to discover that it was [aclla_rescue_attempt_snitch.GetBestName] that cried out just before a large number of guards arrive, weapons at the ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_149;I will take you all on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_149;I surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_150;The guards arrive ready to fight, but they were not prepared to face a [Root.GetManWoman] as skilled as me, and I cut them down easily enough. [aclla_rescue_attempt_snitch.GetBestName] is still nearby. She seems quite surprised that I won, and now I must decide how to deal with her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_150;Go away, and stay away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_150;You has made your last mistake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_151;The guards arrive ready to fight, but though they are able to wound me in the fighting they ultimately prove unable to stop me, and I cut them all down. [aclla_rescue_attempt_snitch.GetBestName] is still nearby. She seems quite surprised that I won, and now I must decide how to deal with her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_151;Go away, and stay away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_151;You has made your last mistake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_152;The guards arrive ready to fight, and I take a grievous wound in the fighting, but in the end I prevail and manage cut them all down.

EVTOPTA_SRI_152;Go away, and stay away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_152;You has made your last mistake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_153;The guards arrive ready to fight, and though I fight hard there is too many of them. Eventually one of them manages to disarm me, and the others quickly pile on. They soon have me tied up, ready to be transported to a cell beneath the Acllahuasi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_153;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_154;The guards are ready to fight, and I take several wounds almost as soon as the fight begins. Though I do my best to fight on, the wounds keep adding up, and several of them are quite bad. It is not long before I am lying on the ground, my vision darkening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_154;And so it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_155;As I search the Acllahuasi for [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName] I come across [aclla_rescue_attempt_lover.GetBestName], a most attractive Aclla that is seemingly all by herself. As an Aclla, she is supposed to remain a virgin until she leaves the Acllahuasi, but perhaps I can convince her to forsake those vows?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_155;I have time for a detour...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_155;I must remain focused...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_156;It turns out [aclla_rescue_attempt_lover.GetBestName] is quite receptive to the idea of forsaking her vows, and the two of us spend some rather enjoyable time together. As I am getting dressed again she asks to come with me, claiming that she does not belong in the Acllahuasi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_156;Come with me if you want to leave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_156;I can't take you with me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SRI_156;You are a loose end to clear up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_157;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] is unwilling to take me with [From.GetHerHim] despite the fact that [From.GetSheHe] clearly does not respect the vows of the Aclla, as evident from the fact that [From.GetSheHe] was willing to sleep with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_157;It is probably for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_157;"Hell hath no fury...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_158;Mere moments after I inform [From.GetBestName] that I have no intention of taking her with me she calls out for the guards. Since I have dealt with them already none appear, and I now have to decide how to deal with a rather surprised, if still scorned, young woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_158;Go away, and stay away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_158;You has made your last mistake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_159;Mere moments after I inform [From.GetBestName] that I have no intention of taking her with me she calls out for the guards. They arrive quite swiftly, weapons at the ready, and demand that I surrender to face Inti's justice after violating the sanctity of the Acllahuasi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_159;I will take you all on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_159;I surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_160;It turns out [aclla_rescue_attempt_lover.GetBestName] is not receptive to the idea of forsaking her vows, though she is somewhat flattered by the attempt and tells ne that she will keep the fact that I am inside the Acllahuasi to herself instead of calling for the guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_160;I think I will trust her...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_160;She is a loose end to clear up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_161;It turns out [aclla_rescue_attempt_lover.GetBestName] is not receptive to the idea of forsaking her vows, and she calls out for the guards. Since I have dealt with them already none appear, and she looks quite surprised when she realizes that things are not going as planned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_161;Go away, and stay away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SRI_162;You has made your last mistake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_163;As I search the Acllahuasi for [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName] I start having second thoughts about what I am doing. I am interfering with matters concerning the Yupaychaspa faith, and thus interfering with the will of Inti himself, and that might not be something I want to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_163;I will continue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_163;I will head home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_164;After spending some time searching the Acllahuasi for [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName] I finally manage to locate her deep inside the building. She is alone when I find her, which probably is for the best, and seems quite surprised to see me after all this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_164;Come with me if you want to leave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_165;[aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName] is quite eager to leave, and aside from quickly gathering some useful supplies she does not waste time with her preparations. Mere minutes have passed when the declares that she is ready to leave the Acllahuasi and to return to [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_165;Follow me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_166;To your surprise, [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName] is not as eager to leave as I had expected. She tells me that I should not have come for her, and that she would rather remain in the Acllahuasi to do whatever is best for the Yupaychaspa faith and the Sapa Inca.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_166;If that really is what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_166;It wasn't a request!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_167;[From.GetBestName] is not willing to leave me in the Acllahuasi, telling me that it is far too dangerous and that I will regret it one day. [From.GetSheHeCap] starts dragging me along, heading towards the nearest exit, and I need to decide if I want to do something about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_167;I guess [From.GetSheHe] knows best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_167;Guards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_168;[From.GetBestName] is not willing to leave me in the Acllahuasi, telling me that it is far too dangerous and that I will regret it one day. Knowing that this is neither what Inti nor what the Sapa Inca would want, I see only one thing to do at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_168;Guards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_169;[From.GetBestName] is most unwilling to come with me from the Acllahuasi, even going as far as to call for the guards to come and stop me from taking her. As I have dealt with them previously, none appear, and she seems quite suprised by this development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_169;See! Nobody cares!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_169;If you won't leave, you will die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SRI_177;I, [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName], and [aclla_rescue_attempt_lover.GetBestName] all make our way out of the Acllahuasi without trouble and hurry through Cuzco, planning to head towards the nearest port where we might find a ship to take us to [Root.Capital.GetName].

EVTDESC_SRI_185;It has been some time since [From.GetBestName] rescued me from the Acllahuasi, and our romantic relationship is still ongoing. Lately, I have been considering the future, as it is quite possible that [From.GetBestName] and I could have a more formal relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_185;Surely he wants to marry me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_185;Surely he wants me as a concubine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SRI_185;Surely this is enough for both of us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_186;[From.GetBestName], the former Aclla that I rescued from the Acllahuasi and that I have been taking to my bed ever since approached me today, suggesting that perhaps it would be right and proper for the two of us to get married.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_186;An excellent suggestion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_186;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_187;[From.GetBestName], the former Aclla that I rescued from the Acllahuasi and that I have been taking to my bed ever since approached me today, suggesting that perhaps it would be right and proper for me to take her as an official concubine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_187;An excellent suggestion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_187;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_189;A messenger arrived from the Acllahuasi today, carrying a missive informing me that [From.GetBestName] has been deemed a Yurac Aclla, which means that she is destinied to be sacrificed to the gods at a time when this would be beneficial for the Yupaychaspa faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_189;It is an honor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_189;I must rescue her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SRI_189_GET_BACK_DAUGHTER;I will look for opportunities to retrieve [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_190;MY Willaq Umu presents before me a new girl who has just been selected from the Acllahuasi as a Huayru Aclla, [From.GetBestName]. The priests have ordained that she is to wed the Sapa Inca.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_190;It would be my pleasure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_190;She should marry [relative_to_marry_aclla.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SRI_190;One of my vassals can have her...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_191;My [GetFromFromRelation] [FromFrom.GetFirstName], who was taken for the Acllahuasi years ago, has grown up to be a prime example of beauty, talent and decorum, and she has been wedded to [FromFrom.Spouse.GetBestName] himself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_191;We are all very proud of her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_193;The Acllahuasi of Cuzco has sent to me a Yurac Aclla. [From.GetFirstName] is one of the finest women to graduate from the sacred convent, and I have been blessed by the Sapa Inca to marry her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_193;Everything for the Sapa Inca!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_193;She should marry [relative_to_marry_aclla.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SRI_193;Sacred or not, she is not my type...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_194;My [GetFromFromRelation] [FromFrom.GetFirstName], who was taken for the Acllahuasi years ago, has grown up to be a fine example of beauty, talent and decorum. She has been wedded to [FromFrom.Spouse.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_194;She will have a good life there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_195;Not all who leave the Aclla do so as perfect examples of femininity. [From.GetBestName] has been deemed flawed in one way or another, but she still has skill, and the Willaq Umu designated her to me as a loyal servant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_195;I'm sure I'll be able to make use of her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_196;I was lost in thoughts during the latest feast, and not pleasant ones either. But [aclla_servant.GetFirstName] caught my attention, and demonstrated a dance from the Apurimac valley. It was wild, yet elegant, and her bracelets loudly rattled with each vigorous movement. The entrancing dance made me forget all about my worries...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_196;Such energy, such grace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_197;One evening, strolling by the courtyard, I come across [aclla_servant.GetFirstName], singing songs about the glory of Inti. Her voice could go high as a songbird and low as a llama, as loud as the sunrise and as soft as a whisper. It made the hairs in my neck rise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_197;She would impress anyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_198;I sit in my room, gnashing my teeth with worries over the problems in my realm. Suddenly I hear a knock on the door, and [aclla_servant.GetFirstName] comes in carrying a small bowl. "Have some Chica, my [Root.GetLordLady]" she says with a rascally grin. "Beer doesn't judge, beer only listens.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_198;Indeed it does!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_199;The past months I have not been getting much sleep as I have been distressed over the state of my realm. However, [aclla_servant.GetFirstName]'s treats are doing their best to relieve that. She bakes the best sancu bread, and frankly, gorging on her delicacies has put my mind at rest more than I'd be willing to admit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_199;That was most definitely an excellent meal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_207;An emissary from the Imperial Palace arrived today, bringing the heavenly news that my [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], was recognised in the Acllahuasi for her finesse, talent and charm. She is going to receive the highest possible honors: that of Quapaq Hucha - to be sacrificed to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_207;We are proud beyond belief!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_207;Not my [GetFromRelation]... I must stop this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SRI_207_GET_BACK_DAUGHTER;I will look for opportunities to retrieve [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_212;I have been informed that another sacrifice to Inti was recently carried out in the mountains near Cuzco. [From.GetBestName] was a shining example of beauty and virtue, and the best possible Qhapaq Hucha to present as a servant for the gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_212;Blessings upon her, and her ayllu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_213;I have received the news that after a year of preparation, [FromFrom.GetBestName] was carried to the top of the Hamp'atu mountain, and there buried alive in the rocks while a priest spoke holy words to appease the mountain gods with the sacrifice. The Sapa Ica has bestowed great honors on my family for producing such a fine young woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_213;We are very proud of her too...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_213;I will avenge her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_215;[qhapaq_hucha.GetBestName] arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName] today, accompanied by a large number of guards and priests and priestesses sworn to Inti. She is due to be sacrificed on a nearby mountain within the next few days, for the glory of the Yupaychaspa faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_215;We are proud beyond belief!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_215;I must stop this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_216;[qhapaq_hucha.GetBestName] is led out of [Root.Capital.GetName] accompanied by the guards and priestesses that arrived along with her from Cuzco. She does not speak to anyone as she walks, perhaps because she is resigned to her faith, or perhaps due to the drugs they have been feeding her, and she does not seem to know you are watching.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_216;I guess I will never see her again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_217;[qhapaq_hucha.GetBestName] is led out of [Root.Capital.GetName] accompanied by the guards and priestesses that arrived along with her from Cuzco. I have prepared for this moment ever since she arrived, and on my signal your soldiers create a diversion, allowing me to get close to her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_217;Come with me if you want to live!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_218;I and [qhapaq_hucha.GetBestName] sneak away as my soldiers keep the guards from Cuzco occupied. I signal my soldiers to wipe out the party from Cuzco, and they comply without hesitation, making it look like a bandit attack. As the battle is dying down, I move to comfort [qhapaq_hucha.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_218;You're safe now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_219;I and [qhapaq_hucha.GetBestName] sneak away as my soldiers keep the guards from Cuzco occupied. Though my soldiers do their best to make it appear as if it was a bandit attack, I later learn that [meddlesome_vassal.GetBestName] saw what happened and has seen fit to inform the Sapa Inca of what I did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_219;Curse that bastard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_220;[qhapaq_hucha.GetBestName] proves to be unwilling to come with me, and she is quite outraged that I have dared to attack the party with her. She firmly declares that she will do as Inti desires, and that I had better leave at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_220;She's lost to me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SRI_221;The party from Cuzco that was travelling with [qhapaq_hucha.GetBestName] has returned to [Root.Capital.GetName] and inform me that the sacrifice was carried out as planned. They tell me that I must not be sad, as what was done was done for the glory of Inti.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SRI_221;Glory... to Inti...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SRI_221;I will avenge her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
