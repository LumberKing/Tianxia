EVTDESC_SOH_3901;I have decided to hold a hanami and to invite my vassals to the celebration, but first it will be necessary for me to make sure that the necessary preparations have been seen to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3901;Let's get started!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3902;While my guests will be staying at my court for some time during the hanami I still need to decide whether the main event will take place during the day or the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3902;I think I'll have it during the day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3902;The night would be more appealing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3903;During the preparations for the hanami I have considered various forms of entertainment for my guests. One option would be to hire some shirabyoshi to entertain my guests. Perhaps I should hire a few.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3903;That would be a good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3903;I should save the money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3904;My capital could perhaps use some embellishments during the hanami. The commoners would appreciate it, for one thing, and chances are the guests would like it too, even though they will most likely only experience it from afar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3904;Some modest decoarations would be worthwhile!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3904;Spare no expense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3904;Who cares about the commoners?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3905;Some of the nearby [Root.Religion.GetName] shrines would doubtlessly appreciate it if I sent some offerings for the kami at the time of the hanami, and I could most likely spare the coin for that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3905;I will send a small offering!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3905;I will send a grand offering!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3905;I think a tainted offering would be best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3905;I see little reason for this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3906;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName] is sending some offerings to a [From.Religion.GetName] shrine in preparation for an upcoming hanami. I believe I have the opportunity to taint these offerings, should I wish to use it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3906;They will be tainted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3906;It is too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3907;My personal garden has seen better days, and with the guests having to spend time there to enjoy the cherry blossoms properly it might be a good idea to improve it ahead of the hanami so that they do not find anything to complain about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3907;I will do it myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3907;I will hire a gardener!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3907;I know how to do that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3907;It isn't worth it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3908;I will need to have food prepared for the hanami. The question is, how much am I willing to spend on it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3909;With the preparations nearing completion it is time for me to invite my vassals to join me for the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3910;[Root.GetTitledName]\n, I hereby invite you to my upcoming hanami. I hope that you will find the time to attend.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3910;I will attend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3910;I won't attend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3911;[Root.GetTitledName]\n, I have no interest in joining you for your hanami at this time, and have to decline your invitation.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3912;Under the Cherry Blossoms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_3912;The cherry blossoms are in full bloom in [Root.Capital.GetName], and it looks like it will be a beautiful day. As my vassals arrive from both near and far I look out across my garden with a smile on my face.\nHopefully, this will be a memorable occasion that is found satisfactory for everyone. If not, it is too late to do anything about it now. I wave over a nearby servant and give them a few quick instructions regarding the final preparations before heading down to greet one of the new arrivals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_3912;The cherry blossoms are in full bloom in [Root.Capital.GetName], and hundreds of paper lanterns hang amongst them to illuminate the night. As my vassals arrive from both near and far I look out across my garden with a smile on my face.\nHopefully, this will be a memorable occasion that everyone finds satisfactory, but there are a thousand things that could go wrong. Of course, it is a bit late to worry about that now, and I do my best to put it out of my mind as I head down to greet one of the recent arrivals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3912;Welcome! Welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_3913;Under the Cherry Blossoms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_3913;The cherry blossoms are in full bloom in [From.Capital.GetName] as my party arrives, and it looks like it will be a beautiful day. My liege, [From.GetTitledName], has invited vassals from both near and far, and I see both familiar faces and faces I barely recognize.\nThe hanami should be a memorable occasion, and I hope that I will have a good time, along with everyone else. Doubtlessly, [From.GetTitledName] has prepared for every eventuality, as [From.GetSheHe] has a smile on [From.GetHerHis] face as [From.GetSheHe] greets me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_3913;The cherry blossoms are in full bloom in [From.Capital.GetName] as my party arrives, and hundreds of paper lanterns hang amongst them to illuminate the night. My liege, [From.GetTitledName], has invited vassals from both near and far, and I see both familiar faces and faces I barely recognize.\nThe hanami should be a memorable occasion, and I hope that everyone will have a good time. Given that [From.GetTitledName] seems unconcerned as [From.GetSheHe] greets me, there should be nothing to worry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3913;Thank you for inviting me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3915;[From.GetTitledName] has seen fit to extensively decorate [From.GetHerHis] capital for the hanami, and it truly is a sight to behold. Even if I ignore the cherry trees themselves, it is a most impressive display.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3915;Indeed it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3916;My servants inform me that they have overheard [From.GetTitledName] speak with approval of the decorations I saw fit to arrange for the people of my capital. Clearly, not only the commoners appreciate the display.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3916;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3917;Aside from the cherry trees in [From.GetTitledName]'s garden and elsewhere [From.Capital.GetName] is almost entirely without decorations. It seems [From.GetTitledName] cannot be bothered to show off [From.GetHerHis] wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3917;This is far too plain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3918;It would seem [From.GetTitledName] has expressed [From.GetHerHis] dislike of the lack of decorations in [Root.Capital.GetName] where people could overhear [From.GetHerHim]. Perhaps I should have invested more in decorations...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3918;Maybe next time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3919;My liege, [From.GetTitledName], has seen fit to send some offerings to a nearby [From.Religion.GetName] shrine as part of the hanami celebration, doubtlessly hoping that the kami will be pleased by this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3919;A good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3919;I should say that I approve...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3920;Shortly after thanks arrived from the shrine I sent offerings to [From.GetTitledName] took the time to add [From.GetHerHis] own thanks to those of the priests at the shrine. It would seem that [From.GetSheHe] was impressed by my generosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3920;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3921;It would seem that [From.GetTitledName] has not seen fit to send a proper offering to the kami at a nearby shrine. The priests did not see fit to complain, but I could still do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3921;I am offended!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3921;I will pretend to be outraged...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3922;[From.GetTitledName] requested a word in private with me, and once we were away from the other guests [From.GetSheHe] angrily complained about the lack of a proper offering for the kami of a nearby shrine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3922;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3924;My attempt to taint the offerings sent to a shrine as part of the hanami has been successful. The priests sent a messenger thanking me profusedly for the offerings, which now pollute the shrine with unholy energies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3924;Perhaps I should send more "gifts"...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3925;A priest arrived today from the shrine I sent offerings to, informing me that the offerings seemed unclean and that the priests had decided not to present them to the kami. However, I do not seem to be under suspicion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3925;It could have gone worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3926;It would seem the priests at the shrine I sent some tainted offerings to are a suspicious lot. The sabotage was discovered, and now fingers are being pointed my way. Nothing can be proven, but...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3926;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3928;My tainting of the offerings [FromFrom.GetTitledName] sent to the kami at a nearby shrine went well. The priests have sent word that they are thankful for the offerings, and clearly they are not suspecting that their shine has been befouled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3928;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3929;My attempt to taint the offerings [FromFrom.GetTitledName] sent to the kami at a nearby shrine did not pan out. The priests discovered that something was awry with the offerings right away, even if my involvement does not seem to be suspected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3929;Not as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3930;Word has reached me from the shrine I sent some offerings to that someone has attempted to pollute them. The priests are convinced that I am not to blame, but they cannot determine whose fault it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3930;Who did this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3931;I attempted to taint the offerings [FromFrom.GetTitledName] sent to the kami at a nearby shrine, but this has turned out poorly. There is no proof, but I have heard whispers suggesting my involvement, and perhaps someone will believe them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3931;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3932;The hanami at [From.GetTitledName]'s capital is mainly taking place beneath the cherry trees in the garden. I have seen well-tended gardens in the past, but the garden of [From.GetTitledName] is one of the best I have encountered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3932;I really like it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3933;[From.GetTitledName] appears to be awestruck at the state of my garden, and has been heard praising the work that has been done there in preparation for the hanami. Evidently, I made the right decision to improve it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3933;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3934;While the cherry trees in [From.GetTitledName]'s garden are in full bloom, the effect is somewhat diminished by the poor state of the garden as a whole. It seems [From.GetTitledName] does not care about tending it at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3934;How unsightly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3935;I did not put a lot of effort into improving my garden before the start of the hanami, and [From.GetTitledName] appears to be horrified at the state of it as [From.GetSheHe] has been heard loudly complaining about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3935;Not great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3936;While [From.GetTitledName] has prepared some diversions during the hanami [From.GetSheHe] does not appear to have seen fit to hire any entertainers despite it being a perfect occasion to bring out some shirabyoshi to entertain everyone present.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3936;This is boring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3937;[From.GetTitledName] has been complaining loudly about the lack of shirabyoshi where all of the guests could overhear [From.GetHerHim]. Perhaps I should have paid for some entertainment to avoid upsetting [From.GetHerHim] and everyone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3937;Not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3938;The shirabyoshi I hired to entertain my guests did not show up on time, and as more and more time passes I slowly realize that they probably are not coming. Given that they have not seen fit to send an explanation they have probably just left with my money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3938;Thieves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3939;[From.GetTitledName] has been claiming that there would be shirabyoshi entertaining the guests at some point during the hanami, but they never made an appearance, and [From.GetTitledName] has offered no explanation as to why they did not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3939;Were any actually hired?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3940;The shirabyoshi I hired show up on time and start to entertain the guests with their music and dancing. However, I quickly realize that they are not particularly skilled in their chosen field, and the entertainment is not particularly enjoyable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3940;I want my money back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3941;[From.GetTitledName] has hired some shirabyoshi to entertain everyone at the hanami, but they are not particularly good as their songs are off-key and their dancing is uncoordinated at best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3941;Make them stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3942;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledName], has hired some shirabyoshi to perform at [From.GetHerHis] hanami, and I find their entertainment inspiring. I have the opportunity to approach them to ask for advice on a certain skill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3942;Teach me how to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3942;Tell me about business!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3942;Tell me about poetry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3942;Teach me to convince!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3943;It seems my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetBestName] has been inspired by the shirabyoshi I hired and has learned from them after talking with them for a while. Hopefully, this will be an advantage in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3943;It will certainly not hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3944;As I take a walk amongst the cherry trees on my own I come across [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. I have always been curious about whether the shirabyoshi know how to use the swords they wear, and when I inquire about it [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] suggests a duel to find out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3944;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3944;This is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3945;[From.GetTitledName] has approached me and let me know that [From.GetSheHe] and [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] are planning to duel one another as [From.GetTitledName] wants to know if the shirabyoshi can fight or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3945;I'll allow it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3945;This is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3946;My liege, [From.GetTitledName], has refused my request to duel [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], claiming that that is not the kind of entertainment [From.GetSheHe] hired the shirabyoshi to perform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3946;I could have taken her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3947;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] were apparently planning to fight a duel to find out if the latter only carries a sword for show or if she actually knows how to use it, but it would seem [From.GetTitledName] has forbidden it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3947;It could have been fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3948;My liege, [From.GetTitledName], has approved my request to duel [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. As the final preparations are being made I need to determine how I will approach the duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3948;I will hold back a bit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3948;I will fight fairly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3948;I will fight dirty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_3948;I will fight to kill!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3949;[From.GetTitledName] will soon be fighting me in a duel to find out if I can fight or if my sword is just for show. I need to decide how I want to approach the duel carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3950;It seems [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [troublesome_shirabyoshi] will soon be fighting a duel, supposedly because [FromFrom.GetTitledName] is curious about whether shirabyoshi know how to fight. Perhaps it will be for show, or perhaps the two combatants will try to kill one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3950;This should be fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3952;The duel between me and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] is not over in an instant, but I gain the upper hand relatively quickly and keep the pressure up until I can manage to disarm the shirabyoshi.\n"The fight is yours, my [Root.GetLordLady]," she says, bowing her head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3952;Well fought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3952;Was that all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3952;And now you die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_3953;[From.GetTitledName]'s duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] was a bit more drawn out than expected, but eventually [From.GetTitledName] prevailed. Surprisingly enough, [From.GetTitledName] still seemed convinced that [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] was a competent fighter, complimenting her for putting up a good fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_3953;[From.GetTitledName]'s duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] was a bit more drawn out than expected, but eventually [From.GetTitledName] prevailed. However, instead of being a good winner [From.GetTitledName] decided to mock the shirabyoshi for thinking that she had a chance in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3953;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_3954;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] managed to win [FromFrom.GetHerHis] duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], even if it was not a quick victory. It seems as if the shirabyoshi impressed [FromFrom.GetTitledName], though, since [FromFrom.GetSheHe] saw fit to compliment her skills after the duel was over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_3954;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] managed to win [FromFrom.GetHerHis] duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], even if it was not a quick victory. Upon disarming the shirabyoshi [FromFrom.GetTitledName] saw fit to be a poor winner and mocked the shirabyoshi for challenging [FromFrom.GetHerHim] in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3954;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3955;[From.GetTitledName]'s duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] was a bit more drawn out than expected, but eventually [From.GetTitledName] prevailed. However, apparently simply disarming the shirabyoshi was not good enough for [From.GetTitledName] as [From.GetSheHe] decided to strike down the unarmed woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3955;How uncivilized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3956;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] managed to win [FromFrom.GetHerHis] duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], even if it was not a quick victory. The shirabyoshi surrendered upon losing her sword, but [FromFrom.GetTitledName] did not see fit to let her live and struck her down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3956;How uncivilized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3957;My duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] goes on for quite some time with neither of us getting the upper hand, and eventually [FromFromFromFrom.GetTitledName] declares it a draw. I need to decide whether I should claim I held back or if I should acknowledge her skill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3957;You're good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3957;I held back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3958;[From.GetTitledName] and [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s duel went on for a considerable amount of time without either party getting the upper hand, and eventually you had to declare it a draw. Surprisingly, [From.GetTitledName] saluted the shirabyoshi and praised her skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3958;Was she that good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3959;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s duel was indecisive, and [From.GetTitledName] eventually had to call it a draw. Surprisingly enough, this outcome appears to have been acceptable for [FromFrom.GetTitledName] as [FromFrom.GetSheHe] saluted the shirabyoshi at the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3959;Was she that good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3960;[From.GetTitledName] and [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s duel went on for a considerable amount of time without either party getting the upper hand, and eventually you had to declare it a draw. [From.GetTitledName] loudly claimed that [From.GetSheHe] held back as [From.GetSheHe] sheathed [From.GetHerHis] sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3960;Sore loser...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3961;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]'s duel was indecisive, and [From.GetTitledName] eventually had to call it a draw. As [FromFrom.GetSheHe] sheathed [FromFrom.GetHerHis] sword, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] loudly claimed that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] was holding back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3961;Sore loser...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3962;My duel against [From.GetTitledName] is not completely one-sided, but I gain the upper hand eventually and manage to disarm [From.GetHerHim]. I could demand [From.GetHerHis] surrender at this point, or just strike [From.GetHerHim] down where [From.GetSheHe] stands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3962;Well fought, my [From.GetLordLady]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3962;All who oppose me must die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3964;My duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] does not go well. It is not entirely one-sided, but eventually the shirabyoshi prevails and manages to disarm me, and I am forced to yield. I might be able to claim that I did not fight at my full potential, should I wish to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3964;Well fought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3964;I held back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3965;[From.GetTitledName]'s duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] was not particularly even, and eventually the shirabyoshi triumphed. Surprisingly enough, [From.GetTitledName] did not seem to have an hard feelings towards [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], and instead praised her skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3965;Was she that good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3966;[From.GetTitledName] did not prevail in [From.GetHerHis] duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. However, instead of trying to save face, [From.GetTitledName] decided to praise the shirabyoshi's skills after the fight was over, which seemed to please her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3966;Was she that good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3967;[From.GetTitledName]'s duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] was not particularly even, and eventually the shirabyoshi triumphed. As the shirabyoshi walked away [From.GetTitledName] loudly proclaimed that [From.GetSheHe] was holding back the whole time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3967;Sore loser...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3968;[From.GetTitledName] did not prevail in [From.GetHerHis] duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. As the shirabyoshi sheathed her sword and started to walk away [From.GetTitledName] started to claim that [From.GetSheHe] was holding back the whole time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3968;Sore loser...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3969;My duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] does not go well. It is not entirely one-sided, but eventually the shirabyoshi prevails and manages to disarm me. Before I have the chance to yield she raises her sword again and cuts me down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3969;NOOOOO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3970;[troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] managed to prevail against [From.GetTitledName] in their duel, and the shirabyoshi was not content with simply defeating her opponent. Before [From.GetTitledName] manages to surrender [From.GetSheHe] was cut down by [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3970;How uncivilized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3970;Imprison that woman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3971;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] did not win [FromFrom.GetHerHis] duel against [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], and the shirabyoshi was completely merciless on victory, striking [FromFrom.GetTitledName] down where [FromFrom.GetSheHe] stands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3971;How uncivilized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3972;Amongst the shirabyoshi I hired [remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] truly stands out as exceptional, and she offers to stay at my court after the hanami is over. This is too good an opportunity to turn down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3972;Stay as long as you like!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3973;One of the shirabyoshi [From.GetTitledName] hired, [From.remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], has proven to be a far better performer than the average shirabyoshi, and I am not surprised when I learn that she will become a permanent member of [From.GetTitledName]'s court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3973;Good for [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3975;There is always a risk that the weather will be bad during the day of the hanami, which can ruin the experience, but the weather could not have been better this time, and everyone can fully enjoy the festivities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3975;I couldn't have picked a better date!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3976;I have had some fun when spending my time with [From.hanami_friend_2.GetBestName] at [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami. Perhaps this is the start of a true friendship?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3976;Let's be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3976;I think I have enough friends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3977;[From.GetBestName] appears to like my company at [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s hanami quite a bit, and I also enjoy their company. It comes as no surprise when [From.GetBestName] suggests the two of us should become friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3977;Let's be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3977;Let's not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_3978;[From.GetBestName] seems to have enjoyed my company too, as [From.GetSheHe] is happy to declare me [From.GetHerHis] friend. Surely, this is the start of a beautiful friendship!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_3978;It would seem [From.GetBestName] has not enjoyed my company as much as I have enjoyed spending time with [From.GetHerHim], seeing as [From.GetSheHe] just told me that [From.GetSheHe] has no interest in becoming my friend friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_SOH_3978;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3978;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3979;During [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami [From.hanami_rival_2.GetBestName] has been extremely poor company, and I cannot help but to feel insulted by the way they speak to me. Perhaps I should demand an apology?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3979;It's the least I am owed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3979;Let's not make this worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3980;[From.GetBestName] appears to have taken some things I have said during [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s hanami personally, and [From.GetSheHe] has demanded that I apologize for the things I have said.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3980;I will never apologize! For anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3980;Of course I'll apologize!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_3981;[From.GetBestName] refused to apologize to me. It is clear that this is the start of a rivalry between the two of us, as [From.GetSheHe] clearly cannot be trusted to behave in a civilized fashion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_3981;[From.GetBestName] apparently did not mean the things [From.GetSheHe] said before and has apologized over the perceived insult, seemingly sincerely sorry to have offended me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3981;I hate you too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3981;Apology accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3982;During the hanami I come across [arguing_hanami_vassal_1.GetBestName] and [arguing_hanami_vassal_2.GetBestName] loudly arguing with one another. I cannot tell what the reason for their quarrel is, but perhaps I could try to smooth things over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3982;Try to calm them down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3982;Quietly walk away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3983;It seems my attempt to smooth things over has been successful, for [arguing_hanami_vassal_1.GetBestName] and [arguing_hanami_vassal_2.GetBestName] quickly calm down and are conversing as friends again by the time I am walking away from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3983;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3984;During [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami I and and another vassal ended up arguing over a misunderstanding. Luckily, [From.GetTitledName] managed to clear up the misunderstanding and I now know that there was no reason to get angry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3984;Thanks for the help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3985;My attempt to meddle in the argument between [arguing_hanami_vassal_1.GetBestName] and [arguing_hanami_vassal_2.GetBestName] did not go well, and they are now angry with both me and one another. Perhaps it would have been better if I had not meddled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3985;Not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3986;During [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami I and another vassal ended up arguing with one another. [From.GetTitledName] apparently thought that [From.GetSheHe] could be a diplomat and clear things up, but [From.GetSheHe] only made things worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3986;This is not a minor misunderstanding!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3987;A priestess from a nearby shrine made an unexpected appearance at my hanami, offering to say a few words and to make a small offering to the kami in my name after I welcomed her to the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3987;Sure, why not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3988;As [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami continues I find myself talking to [From.hanami_lover_2.GetBestName], a very lovely [From.hanami_lover_2.GetManWoman]. I cannot tell for sure, but they might be interested in me in a romantic way, and it would be easy to slip away into the night with them if they agree to it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3988;I will try to seduce them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3988;It is too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3989;I have been talking to [From.GetBestName] for quite some time at [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s hanami and think that they are a fine [From.GetManWoman]. It does not surprise me particularly much when [From.GetSheHe] suggests that the two of us should find someplace private to get to know one another more closely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3989;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3989;No, I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3990;[From.GetBestName] did not seem to appreciate my attempt to get to know them intimately, and [From.GetSheHe] hastily ended our conversation and hurried away. Hopefully, they will not speak of my suggestion with anyone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3990;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3991;[From.GetBestName] was amenable to my suggestion to slip away into the darkness to get to know one another intimately, and it is not long before we find a secluded part of [FromFromFrom.GetTitledName]'s garden and start to get undressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3991;It is good to be the [Root.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3992;I have taken a short break from the festivities and am taking a walk through a secluded part of my garden when I hear a sound from behind some bushes. I go around them and find [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] entwined with one another, neither of them wearing any clothes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3992;I saw nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3992;I wonder what my silence is worth...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3992;Everyone will hear about this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3993;[From.GetTitledName] stumbled upon me and [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] in a compromising position, but it appears that [From.GetSheHe] is content to keep it secret, at least for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3993;Phew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3994;[From.GetTitledName] stumbled upon me and [FromFrom.GetBestName] in a compromising position, but it appears that [From.GetSheHe] is content to keep it secret, at least for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3994;Phew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3995;[From.GetTitledName] discovered me and [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] together in a compromising position. Before either of us could speak [From.GetTitledName] asked us what [From.GetHerHis] silence is worth to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3995;I'll pay for your silence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3995;I'll consider it a Favor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_3995;I won't be blackmailed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPA_SOH_3995;I will pay [From.GetBestName] some gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPB_SOH_3995;I will owe [From.GetBestName] a Favor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3996;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] discovered me and [From.GetBestName] together in a compromising position. Before either of us can speak [FromFrom.GetTitledName] asked us what [FromFrom.GetHerHis] silence is worth to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPA_SOH_3996;I will pay [FromFrom.GetBestName] some gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPB_SOH_3996;I will owe [FromFrom.GetBestName] a Favor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3997;Both [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] agreed to pay me to keep their tryst secret without any complaints.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3997;I will keep it secret, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPA_SOH_3997;[This.GetBestName] pays me 25 gold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPB_SOH_3997;[This.GetBestName] owes me a Favor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3998;I could not get [hanami_lover_1.GetBestName] and [hanami_lover_2.GetBestName] to agree to any concessions in exchange for my silence, and this leaves me no option but to expose their tryst to everyone at the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3998;You asked for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3999;[From.GetTitledName] has outed my tryst to everyone at the hanami, and since there is no possible way for me to attempt to cover up the situation the scandal is a fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3999;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4000;[From.GetTitledName] somehow caught wind of the fact that [FromFrom.GetBestName] and [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] were sleeping together, and has outed their relationship to everyone at the hanami. Given that the two were discovered together in a state of undress there is no plausible alternative explanation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4000;How scandalous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4000;They will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4000;I will not forgive this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4001;It seems the sounds from my hanami carries well beyond my garden, seeing as some of the townspeople have sent a messenger asking me to try to quiet things down a bit so that they can sleep properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4001;We'll tone it down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4001;Shut up, peasant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4002;In the middle of the night I can see something or someone moving about in the darkness just at the edge of my vision. I cannot tell who or what it is, and it might just be my mind playing tricks on me, but that is not certain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4002;Who goes there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4002;Guards! GUARDS!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4003;I have made sure that there is plenty of sake for the guests at my hanami, and I know for sure that there is enough to go around even if I have some. Surely there is no harm in drinking some?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4003;A little wouldn't hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4003;I'm thirsty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4003;I can't stop myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4004;The cherry blossoms at the hanami are certainly inspiring, and I find myself in the mood for writing some poetry. Perhaps I should challenge [From.GetTitledName] to a poetry contest?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4004;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4004;I'd rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4005;[From.GetTitledName] appears to feel inspired by the cherry blossoms and has suggested that the two of us should compete with one another in a poetry contest. I can of course turn it down, but maybe it would be fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4005;Challenge accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4005;Maybe another time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4006;It would seem [From.GetTitledName] has no interest in poetry as [From.GetSheHe] turned down my challenge to a poetry content, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] had better things to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4006;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4008;After I and my opponent have written our poems we hand them over to some of the other guests to read so that they may choose a winner. After some deliberation they decide that I have won.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4008;I am a poet now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4008;That was nice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4008;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4009;After I and my opponent have written our poems we hand them over to some of the other guests to read so that they may choose a winner. After some deliberation they decide that I have lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4009;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4010;[From.hanami_duel_vassal_2.GetBestName] has insulted me during the hanami, and I would be well within my rights to challenge them to a duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4010;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4010;Let's not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4011;Apparently [From.GetBestName] feels that I have insulted [From.GetHerHim] at the hanami, and [From.GetSheHe] is now challenging me to a duel. However, if I apologize the duel could be avoided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4011;Bring it on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4011;I'm sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4012;It appears [From.GetBestName] does not wish to fight me, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] instead has apologized for upsetting me. Perhaps it is for the best to let the matter rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4012;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_4013;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. The duel has already taken place, and [From.GetTitledName] has triumphed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_4013;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. The duel has already taken place, and neither came out ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_SOH_4013;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. The duel has already taken place, and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] has triumphed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4013;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_4014;I and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, and I eventually gain the upper hand, disarming them easily enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_4014;I and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, but it becomes clear that neither of us can get the upper hand, and eventually we decide to end the duel without a winner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_SOH_4014;I and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, and they eventually gain the upper hand. Before long I have been disarmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_SOH_4014;I and [From.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, and they eventually gain the upper hand. Before long I have been disarmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_SOH_4014;I and [From.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, but it becomes clear that neither of us can get the upper hand, and eventually we decide to end the duel without a winner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCF_SOH_4014;I and [From.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, and you eventually gain the upper hand, disarming them easily enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4014;Yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4014;Let's call it a draw!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4014;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4014;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_4014;Let's call it a draw!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_4014;Yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_4015;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. The duel has already taken place, and [From.GetTitledName] has triumphed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_4015;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. The duel has already taken place, and neither came out ahead in the duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_SOH_4015;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. The duel has already taken place, and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] has triumphed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4015;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4016;[From.GetTitledName] has has several truly magnificient meals prepared for the hanami. Doubtlessly, [From.GetSheHe] would like to hear if [From.GetHerHis] guests liked the food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4016;Approve publicly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4016;Disapprove publicly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4016;Stay silent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4017;[From.GetTitledName] has has several decent meals prepared for the hanami. Doubtlessly, [From.GetSheHe] would like to hear if [From.GetHerHis] guests liked the food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4018;[From.GetTitledName] has has several rather plain meals prepared for the hanami. Doubtlessly, [From.GetSheHe] would like to hear if [From.GetHerHis] guests liked the food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4019;Apparently, [From.GetTitledName] likes the quality of the food I had my servants prepare for the hanami and has seen fit to publicly praise you for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4019;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4020;Apparently, [From.GetTitledName] does not like the quality of the food I had my servants prepare for the hanami and has seen fit to publicly complain about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4020;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4022;As the hanami continues I come across [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] several more times and find her company enjoyable. Perhaps the two of us should try to get to know one another better?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4022;We should be lovers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4022;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4022;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4023;It seems [From.GetBestName] fancies me as [From.GetSheHe] has suggested that we should retire to [From.GetHerHis] bedchamber to get to know one another more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4023;I like how [From.GetSheHe] thinks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4023;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4024;[From.GetBestName] proved to be amenable to my suggestion, and soon the two of us have managed to find our way to my bedchamber. It does not take long before the two of us are fully undressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4024;This is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4025;It seems [From.GetBestName] has no interest in becoming my lover, seeing as she turned down my suggestion and quickly hurried away. Perhaps she will change her mind in the future, but it will not happen during the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4025;I see..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4026;[From.GetBestName] seems to have taken an interest in getting to know me better after our duel, and now it seems [From.GetSheHe] wishes to be my friend. The question is, do I think [From.GetSheHe] would make a good friend?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4026;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4026;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4027;[From.GetBestName] is elated when I propose that the two of us should begin a long-term friendship. Regardless of how the duel went, it seems we can put your differences aside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4027;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4028;It seems [From.GetBestName] has no interest in becoming my friend. Perhaps the events surrounding my duel with her are to blame, but it is possible that that is not the only reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4028;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4029;[shirabyoshi_foe.GetBestName] did not treat me courteously at the end of my duel with [shirabyoshi_foe.GetHerHim]. As the hanami continues I believe that I see an opportunity to kill [shirabyoshi_foe.GetHerHim], and I consider taking advantage of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4029;[shirabyoshi_foe.GetSheHeCap] must die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4029;It is too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4030;As I am walking by myself in a secluded part of [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s garden, [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] appears out of nowhere with her sword in her hand. With a loud war cry she moves to attack me, clearly wishing to kill me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4030;Try to fight her;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4030;Try to flee;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4031;Somehow I manage to slip away from [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] in the garden without being wounded. I suspect that she still is looking for me, and waste no time before ordering her arrest when I encounter some of the guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4031;Find that woman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4032;It seems [From.GetBestName] has been attacked by [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], the shirabyoshi [From.GetSheHe] fought a duel against previously. The attack was unsuccessful, but so was the attempt to apprehend the shirabyoshi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4032;Let her run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4033;I make my best attempt to slip away from [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], but in my haste I trip over a rock and fall to the ground. Before I can get back to my feet or draw my sword the shirabyoshi is upon me, and she shows me no mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4033;NOOOOOO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4034;Some of my guards stumbled upon the lifeless body of [From.GetBestName] in the garden. It would seen that an unknown assailant attacked [From.GetHerHim] and killed [From.GetHerHim], presumably with a sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4034;Who could have done this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4034;I have some suspicions, but...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4034;The shirabyoshi did it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4035;I draw my sword and meet [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] head on. The shirabyoshi is a decent enough fighter, as I learned before, but she is no match for me, and I manage to find an opening and quickly strike her down without her inflicting so much as a scratch on me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4035;Now we know the better fighter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4036;[From.GetBestName] returns after having taken a walk alone elsewhere in my garden and quickly informs me that [From.GetSheHe] was attacked by [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] and was forced to kill her in self-defense, taking no wounds in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4036;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4037;I draw my sword and meet [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] head on. The shirabyoshi is a decent enough fighter, as I learned before, and she inflicts several wounds on me before I manage to strike her down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4037;That will probably scar...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4038;[From.GetBestName] returns after having taken a walk alone elsewhere in my garden, and quickly informs me that [From.GetSheHe] was attacked by [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] and was forced to kill her in self-defense. Judging by [From.GetHerHis] wounds, [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] did not go down without a fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4038;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4039;I draw my sword and meet [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] head on. The shirabyoshi is a good fighter, as I learned before, and though I manage to strike her down in the end she has severely wounded me in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4039;At least I survived...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4040;[From.GetBestName] returns after having taken a walk alone elsewhere in my garden, severely injured, but with a smile on [From.GetHerHis] face. Apparently, [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] attacked [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetSheHe] narrowly managed to beat her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4040;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4041;I draw my sword and meet [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] head on. The shirabyoshi is a good fighter, and she manages to find an opening in my defenses quickly enough, drawing blood. One wound becomes two, then three, and eventually I lack the strength to keep her from striking me down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4041;NOOOOOO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4042;Some of my guards stumbled upon the lifeless body of [From.GetBestName] in the garden. As the shirabyoshi [From.GetSheHe] fought earlier, [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], is nowhere to be found it seems that she killed [From.GetHerHim] and then fled before the body was discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4042;Let her run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4043;The shirabyoshi I fought before, [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], was a competent fighter, which resulted in humiliation for me. Still, I believe I know her weaknesses now, and I think I see an opportunity to kill her, if I wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4043;She must die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4043;It would be a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4044;I surprise [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], though not to such an extent that she is unable to put up some resistance. However, the fight quickly turns in my favor, and I manage to kill her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4044;I win this time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4045;I surprise [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], though not to such an extent that she is unable to put up some resistance, and she manages to inflict several minor wounds before the fight turns in my favor and I manage to cut her down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4045;'Tis but a scratch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4046;I surprise [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], though not to such an extent that she is unable to put up some resistance. She manages to get in several good strikes, and I do not walk away from the fight in one piece despite eventually cutting her down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4046;At least I still live...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4047;It seems [From.GetBestName] has attacked [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] in my garden. It is doubtful that it was in self-defense, but I cannot punish [From.GetBestName] without knowing for sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4047;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4048;[troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] is not surprised as I move to attack her, and she meets me with her sword drawn. Before long, the fight turns against me, and eventually she strikes me down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4048;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4049;[troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] is not surprised as I move to attack her, and she meets me with her sword drawn. Though I manage to wound her the fight turns against me, and eventually she strikes me down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4049;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4050;[troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] is not surprised as I move to attack her, and she meets me with her sword drawn. I make sure that she will not walk away in one piece, but the fight turns against me, and eventually she strikes me down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4050;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4051;[troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] demands to speak with me, and I agree to her request. She tells me that [From.GetBestName] attacked her in my garden and that she was forced to kill [From.GetHerHim] in self-defense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4051;You did the right thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4051;Leave my court, now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4051;Guards, seize her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4052;Apparently, [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been killed by [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. According to the shirabyoshi, it was in self-defense, and [From.GetTitledName] apparently believes her, allowing her to remain free and at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4052;She should be imprisoned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4053;Apparently, [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been killed by [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. According to the shirabyoshi, it was in self-defense, and [From.GetTitledName] apparently believes her, allowing her to remain free, though not at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4053;She should be imprisoned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4054;Apparently, [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been killed by [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. According to the shirabyoshi, it was in self-defense, but [From.GetTitledName] still has seen fit to imprison her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4054;Serves her right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4055;[troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]'s skill with a sword was most impressive, and I have decided to learn from her. She teaches me quite a few tricks in a surprisingly short amount of time, and I find that we have more in common than an interest in swordfighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4055;I have a new friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4056;It seems [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] and [From.GetBestName] have become friends and that the shirabyoshi is teaching my [GetFromRelation] how to fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4056;That's... good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4057;[remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] is a most impressive woman, and I find that I am enjoying spending time with her. Perhaps we can get to know each other better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4057;I will try to seduce her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4057;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4057;No, this is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4058;[From.GetTitledName] seems to have been enjoying my performance throughout the hanami, and it does not come as a big surprise when [From.GetSheHe] suggests that perhaps I should come with [From.GetHerHim] somewhere more private for a different form of entertainment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4058;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4058;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4059;[From.GetBestName] agreed to my suggestion that the two of us should retire to somewhere private, and it does not take very long before both of us are undressed and getting to know one another more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4059;It is good to be the [Root.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4060;My suggestion that I and [From.GetBestName] should retire to somewhere private was not appreciated by the shirabyoshi, and she hastily excused herself and headed elsewhere. While still in my court, it seems like she will not be in my bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4060;Not as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4061;It seems [From.GetTitledName] truly is enjoying my company, and that [From.GetSheHe] wishes to remain on good terms with me. Indeed, [From.GetSheHe] has suggested that we perhaps should be friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4061;Let's be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4061;I'd rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4062;[From.GetBestName] seems very open to the idea of being friends with me. Doubtlessly this will only mean good things for me as she truly is a remarkable woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4062;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4063;Despite me generous suggestion [From.GetBestName] does not seem open to the idea of becoming friends with me. Perhaps it will change over time, but perhaps not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4063;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4064;[remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] does not cease to impress as the hanami continues. Her singing voice is beautiful, her dancing is impeccable, and her poetry is awe-inspiring. I could not have found a better shirabyoshi for my hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4064;She truly is amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4065;[From.remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], one of the shirabyoshi [From.GetTitledName] hired for [From.GetHerHis] hanami, truly is something special. Her singing voice is beautiful, her dancing is impeccable, and her poetry is awe-inspiring. I am not sure I have ever seen better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4065;She truly is amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4066;The shirabyoshi I hired for the hanami have performed quite well throughout the event. While none of them are truly exceptional, there is no doubt that they still are well-trained entertainers fit to entertain the likes of me and my guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4066;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4067;The shirabyoshi [From.GetTitledName] hired for [From.GetHerHis] hanami are quite good. They are not the kind of great shirabyoshi I am unlikely to see more than a few times in a lifetime, but they are certainly not bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4067;Keep on performing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4068;The shirabyoshi [From.GetTitledName] hired for [From.GetHerHis] hanami are getting on my nerves. While they are unfailingly polite towards everyone else, the behaviour they show towards me is anything but polite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4068;I want them gone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4069;[From.GetTitledName] has told ne that [From.GetSheHe] feels that the shirabyoshi I hired are being extremely impolite towards [From.GetHerHim], and has asked me to expel them from the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4069;Throw them out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4069;They can stay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4070;[From.GetTitledName] agreed to throw out the shirabyoshi as I requested. There will be less entertainment now, but at least the impolite shirabyoshi are not going to ruin the hanami for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4070;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4071;[From.GetTitledName] did not believe me when I claimed that the shirabyoshi were being rude towards me, and [From.GetSheHe] has decided to allow them to stay at the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4071;Why take their side?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4072;I have been spending some time with [From.hanami_child_friend_rival.GetBestName] at [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami, and [From.hanami_child_friend_rival.GetSheHe] seems to have a lot in common with me. Perhaps I should attempt to become [From.hanami_child_friend_rival.GetHerHis] friend?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4072;Yes, let's do that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4072;I have enough friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4073;[From.GetBestName] and I have spent some time together at [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s hanami, and I have enjoyed [From.GetHerHis] company. It seems the feeling is mutual, and [From.GetBestName] has suggested that we should be friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4073;Let's be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4073;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_4074;[From.GetBestName] seemed thrilled at the prospect of becoming my friend, and [From.GetSheHe] said that my company truly had been enjoyable at the hanami. Hopefully we will have more fun together in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_4074;It seems [From.GetBestName] does not enjoy my company as much as I enjoy [From.GetHerHis] company, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] found my suggestion that we should be friends silly and told me that it was not going to happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4074;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4074;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4075;[From.hanami_child_friend_rival.GetBestName] has been getting on my nerves during [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami, and I find that nearly everything [From.hanami_child_friend_rival.GetSheHe] says is a thinly veiled insult at best. Perhaps I should demand an apology?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4075;I deserve no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4075;It could be a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4076;It seems [From.GetBestName] has been taking your my at [From.GetHerHis] expense very seriously, and [From.GetSheHe] has demanded that I apologize. If not, chances are [From.GetBestName] will hold a grudge towards me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4076;I'm not sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4076;I'm sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_4077;[From.GetBestName] laughed in my face when I demanded an apology for [From.GetHerHis] insults. If [From.GetSheHe] is not going to attempt to be on friendly terms, I will have to treat [From.GetHerHim] as an enemy from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_4077;It seems [From.GetBestName] did not mean to insult me with the things [From.GetSheHe] said, and [From.GetSheHe] seemed most sincere when [From.GetSheHe] issued an apology. I cannot forget what was said, but it is probably best to forgive it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4077;I hate you too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4077;Fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4078;The weather takes a turn for the worse as the hanami progresses. Dark clouds cover the sky, and I can hear thunder in the distance. I might even have to move everyone inside if the situation gets worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4078;That's not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4079;One of my guards informs me that there is a fireworks merchant who wishes to see me. It turns out that he has heard of my hanami and that he is willing to sell me some fireworks to entertain my guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4079;I'll have some of the smaller ones!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4079;Give me a few larger ones!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4079;Give me everything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4079;I cannot afford any...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4080;The fireworks I bought from the merchant seem simple enough to use and I make sure that my guests all will have a good view of the sky before lighting them. The explosions are not particularly impressive, but it seems like the guests still liked the show.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4080;Worth the money, I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4081;[From.GetTitledName] has apparently gotten hold of some fireworks for the hanami. It is not exactly in line with tradition, and they are not the most impressive I have seen, but they are still somewhat entertaining.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4081;That was nice, I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4082;The fireworks I bought from the merchant are a bit complicated, but I manage to figure out how to use them. My guests seem impressed by the view as they light up the sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4082;Money well spent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4083;[From.GetTitledName] has a surprise for me and the other guests in the form of some fireworks [From.GetSheHe] apparently has bought. They light up the sky in a multitude of colors and are a sight to behold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4083;Beautiful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4084;I think I have figured out how to use the fireworks I bought from the merchant, but I get something wrong, and one of them explodes too close to me, and I do not get away in one piece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4084;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4085;[From.GetTitledName] has bought some fireworks for the hanami, but apparently [From.GetSheHe] has not figure out how to use them safely. One of the fireworks explodes right next to [From.GetHerHim], causing a major injury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4085;Play with fire...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4086;I am somewhat afraid of getting something wrong when I use the fireworks I bought, but luckily I get everything right, and the sky is soon set ablaze. Never before have I seen anything quite as magnificient as this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4086;A most impressive display!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4087;[From.GetTitledName] has everyone at the hanami gather where we can get a good view of the sky as [From.GetSheHe] starts setting off a large number of fireworks [From.GetSheHe] apparently has bought for the hanami. Before long, the sky is ablaze in a truly magnificient fashion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4087;A most impressive display!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4088;The fireworks I bought are more complicated than O initially thought, but I believe I have figured out how to use them safely by the time that my guests await the display. Unfortunately, something goes wrong, and I am badly injured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4088;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4089;[From.GetTitledName] brings out a large amount of fireworks and proudly proclaims that we are about to witness something grand. Unfortunately for [From.GetHerHim], the fireworks are less safe than expected, and [From.GetTitledName] is maimed in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4089;Play with fire...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4090;I manage to figure out how to set off the fireworks I bought without harming myself, but one of them flies off into the crowd and blows up right in the face of [fireworks_victim.GetBestName], killing [fireworks_victim.GetHerHim]. The remaining guests look at me in horror.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4090;It was an accident!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4091;[From.GetTitledName] has bought a number of huge fireworks from someone and brings them out at the hanami. [From.GetSheHeCap] manages to set them off without problems at first, but one of them spirals out of control and flies directly at me, blowing up in my face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4091;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4092;[From.GetTitledName] surprises everyone by bringing out a bunch of fireworks. Clearly, [From.GetSheHe] has a magnificient spectacle in mind, but something goes wrong and one of the fireworks hits [From.fireworks_victim.GetBestName] in the face, fatally wounding [From.fireworks_victim.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4092;What a mess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_4093;The Great Fireworks Disaster;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4093;My guests quickly assemble when they hear that I have prepared a grand fireworks display. Everything goes well at first, and the sky is soon lit by colorful explosions. However, before long, things go horribly wrong.\nSoon, there are fireworks flying off off into the town itself, impacting several buildings and starting a number of fires that grow out of control very quickly, and other fireworks strike some of my guests, killing them before they can react.\nBy the time that the last fireworks have gone off, many are dead, and large parts of [Root.Capital.GetName] are ablaze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4093;This is a disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_4094;The Great Fireworks Disaster;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4094;[From.GetTitledName] has proclaimed that there will be a major fireworks display during the hanami, and I and the other guests quickly gather to witness it.\nIt starts well enough, but soon there are fireworks flying off into the crowd and the nearby town, starting fires in several places and killing many people before they can escape to safety.\n[From.GetTitledName] is unhurt, and so am I, but it is clear that this disaster will not be something that [From.Capital.GetName] recovers from anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4094;That was a disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4095;I have taken some time to look at the stars during the hanami, and I am surprised by the appearance of a comet in the sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4095;It's an omen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_SOH_4095;Lose 1 stability;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4097;I and my spouse, [Root.Spouse.GetBestName], have been watching the stars together during the hanami while talking with one another, and I feel that I have gotten much closer to [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim] as a consequence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4097;I love [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4098;I and [hanami_child_friend.GetBestName] have been spending some time together watching the stars during the hanami, and I feel much closer to [hanami_child_friend.GetHerHim] now. In fact, I now consider [hanami_child_friend.GetHerHim] to be one of my best friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4098;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4099;The sky is clear during the night of the hanami, and the stars above are beautiful to behold. I would have loved to have someone to talk to about them, but it seems my guests are more interested in the cherry blossoms than the stars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4099;Those are also beautiful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4100;I and several others at the hanami have decided to take part in an impromptu sparring session in the hopes of improving our swordfighting skills. Hopefully, nothing will go wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4100;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_4101;I do not know why, but as soon as I draw my sword I feel certain that things will go well. I do not distinguish myself by having perfect form, but I show no fear against any of my opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_4101;Not long ago I found the idea of swordfighting dangerous, but during the sparring session I find that I actually have nothing to fear. Perhaps with a little effort I could learn excel at swordfighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_SOH_4101;I do not distinguish myself as much as some do at the sparring session. In fact, I perform worse than I had expected to, and some of the others seem to be hiding smiles as I excuse myself early to avoid further humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_SOH_4101;The sparring session does not go as well as I would have liked. I fumble with a parry and one of the others at the pracitice session accidentally gives me a shallow cut.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_SOH_4101;The sparring session goes very well for me, and I perform very well. Several of the others suggest that I could do well as a duelist, if that is something that interests me. If not, there is still some glory to be had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4101;I fear nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4101;I don't fear swords!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4101;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4101;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_4101;I will be a duelist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_4101;I'll just have the glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4102;I have spent some time at the hanami discussing military strategy with some of your vassals. The discussion went very well, and everyone seems to agree that I know quite a lot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4102;And here I thought I knew less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4102;I should study the Art of War...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4102;I will just have the fame!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4102;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_4102;Just as expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4103;During [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami I sent some time talking about military strategy with the other guests. The discussion went very well, and I got some praise for my knowledge in the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4103;And here I thought I knew less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4103;I should study the Art of War...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4103;I will just have the fame!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4103;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_4103;Just as expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4104;I took part in a discussion about military strategy during my hanami as some of my guests thought that it was a topic worth discussing, but unfortunately nothing I said seemed to impress anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4104;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4105;I spent some time at [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami discussing military strategy with the other guests. Unfortunately, the things I said during the discussion did not seem to impress anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4105;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4106;I and [hanami_go_opponent.GetBestName] found the time to play a game of Go during the hanami. It was not over quickly, and looked quite bad at times, but eventually I was victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4106;I should keep doing this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4106;Victory is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4107;[From.GetTitledName] challenged me to a game of Go during the hanami, and I obliged [From.GetHerHim]. It took some time for the outcome to be clear, but eventually it was clear that I had lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4107;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4108;I and [hanami_go_opponent.GetBestName] found the time to play a game of Go during the hanami. It took some time for the outcome to be clear, but eventually it was clear that I had lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4108;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4109;[From.GetTitledName] challenged me to a game of Go during the hanami, and I obliged [From.GetHerHim]. It was not over quickly, and it looked quite bad at times, but eventually I was victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4109;I should keep doing this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4109;Victory is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4110;The hanami has come to an end, and all of my guests have set off on their journey back home. I will have to wait at least one year before the next hanami can be held, seeing as the cherry blossoms will not bloom again for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4110;That was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4111;[From.GetTitledName]'s hanami is over, and it is time to head home. Whether there will be another hanami next year is unclear, but it certainly will have to wait that long since the cherry blossoms will not bloom again for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4111;That was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4112;With a war breaking out my hanami will have to be postponed, particularly as it is unlikely that the conflict will be over quickly enough for the matter to be resolved before the cherry blossoms are done blooming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4112;That's unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4113;[From.GetTitledName]'s hanami has unfortunately had to be cancelled due to a war breaking out, and it is doubtful that the war will be over before the cherry blossoms are gone for the year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4113;That's unfortunate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
