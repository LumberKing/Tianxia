EVTDESC_SOH_4401;The peasants in [foreigner_landfall_province.GetName] recently encountered a foreign shipwreck. One of the surviving members of the crew is [foreigner_in_japan.GetBestName], a [foreigner_in_japan.GetManWoman] supposedly from [foreigner_origin_province.GetName]. [foreigner_in_japan.GetSheHeCap] has indicated that [foreigner_in_japan.GetSheHe] wishes to enter my service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4401;Foreginers are not welcome here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4401;I welcome you to my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4403;I have recently been spending some time in the company of [foreigners_target.GetBestName], and though the two of us had little knowledge of one another previously we are getting along quite well. In fact, I think the two of us are becoming friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4403;That can only mean good things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4404;I recently spent some time in the company of [From.GetBestName], and though [From.GetSheHe] was something of an unknown to me previously I feel that the two of us already have become friends. After all, we share quite a few opinions and interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4404;I'm sure this means good things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4405;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [foreigners_target.GetBestName] have gotten quite close as of late. It certainly is good to know that [From.GetBestName] can make friends this far from home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4405;Good for them, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4406;I have recently been spending some time in the company of [foreigners_target.GetBestName]. I had thought that maybe we could put our many differences aside, but it is clear that that is not the case, and I do not want to speak to [foreigners_target.GetHerHim] ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4406;I hate [foreigners_target.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4407;I recently spent some time in the company of [From.GetBestName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] was previously something of an unknown to me, and now I know more than enough about [From.GetHerHim] to tell that [From.GetSheHe] is a thoroughly unpleasant individual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4407;I hate [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4408;The latest court gossip that has reached my ears indicate that [From.GetBestName] and [foreigners_target.GetBestName] now hate each other. It is a bit unclear just what happened, but it appears to have been something recent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4408;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4409;Though I have long known that [From.GetBestName] considers [From.GetHerselfHimself] something of a warrior it was still quite surprising when [From.GetSheHe] approached me today and asked me to help [From.GetHerHim] join the Warriors of the Rising Sun, as that certainly is not what I would expect from a foreigner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4409;I will vouch for you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4409;I will train you myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4409;You don't deserve such an honor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4410;[From.GetBestName] has let me know that [From.GetSheHe] will vouch for me and that the Warriors of the Rising Sun should be willing to let me join based on that. [From.GetSheHeCap] has told me that this is quite the honor, and that [From.GetSheHe] expects great things from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4410;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4411;[From.GetBestName] has let me know that [From.GetSheHe] not only will support me when it comes to joining the ranks of the Warriors of the Rising Sun but that [From.GetSheHe] is going to handle my training [From.GetHerselfHimself], which certainly is a great honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4411;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4412;[From.GetBestName] laughed at my request to join the Warriors of the Rising Sun and firmly told me that [From.GetSheHe] considers me unworthy of that honor and that the Warriors of the Rising Sun doubtlessly agree with [From.GetHerHis] assessment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4412;Such arrogance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4413;One day when I am on the road several armed bandits approach me, clearly with ill intentions in mind. It is still possible for me to get away before they are close, but I could also ready a weapon and face them head on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4413;Time to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4413;Time to run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4414;The bandits are taken by complete surprise by my attack, and several of them fall before they realize that I have closed with them. The rest attempt to fight back, but their attempt to do so is quite feeble indeed, and soon I am the only one still standing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4414;A simple matter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4415;[From.GetBestName] returned home in good spirits today. When asked about it [From.GetSheHe] told me that [From.GetSheHe] encountered some bandits on the road, and that the ensuing fight went completely in [From.GetHerHis] favor, which made it a rather enjoyable encounter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4415;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4416;The bandits are taken by surprise by my attack, and one of them falls before they realize that I have closed with them. The rest attempt to fight back, but it does not really matter in the end. However, I am injured in the fight, so it was not as clean a victory as it could have been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4416;That hurt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4417;One day [From.GetBestName] returns home somewhat injured but still reasonably happy. [From.GetSheHeCap] later reveals that [From.GetSheHe] came across some bandits and that [From.GetSheHe] was injured in the ensuing fight. Seeing as the fight ended in victory, it could have gone worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4417;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4418;The bandits are ready when I move to attack them, and I am wounded quite quickly. Eventually, I manage to get the upper hand against them and force them all to run or die, but at that point I have taken a grievous wound that I doubt I ever truly will recover from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4418;They almost got me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4419;Today [From.GetBestName] returned home badly injured. [From.GetSheHeCap] is quickly tended to by various servants, even if they are unable to do much for [From.GetHerHim]. Based on what they tell me, [From.GetBestName] apparently fought a large number of bandits single-handedly and barely prevailed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4419;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4420;The bandits are ready when I move to attack them, and I get badly wounded early on in the battle. I do ,y best to fight on, but there is too many of them, and weight of numbers alone can decide a fight. It does not take long before I am lying on the ground, bleeding from several fatal wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4420;And so it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4421;A messenger arrrived outside the gates today, carrying a message informing me that the body of [From.GetBestName] has been found on the road. Based on the injuries on the body and the fact that it was stripped clean of all valuables, I suspect it to be the work of bandits, even if I might never know for sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4421;[From.GetSheHeCap] will be missed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4422;[From.GetBestName] returned home quite shaken today, claiming that that there were bandits behind [From.GetHerHim]. Though it is possible that there might be bandits nearby, I rather doubt that there is close to as many as [From.GetSheHe] claims, and as far as I am concerned [From.GetSheHe] should have fought any [From.GetSheHe] encountered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4422;How cowardly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4423;One evening when I am having a drink in a local tavern one of the locals bumps into me and causes me to spill my drink all over myself. I turn around and demand an apology, but the man just laughs and claims that I spilled my drink on my own, seeing as I am a "foreign savage".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4423;Now you've done it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4424;At first, it is just me and the man that bumped into me that are fighting, but the fighting soon spreads throughout the tavern, drawing in more and more of the locals. Eventually, the local town watch has to intervene, dragging everyone outside. Given that the man that bumped into me is unconscious and I am not, things went quite well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4424;Worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4425;At first, it is just me and the man that bumped into me that are fighting, but the fighting soon spreads throughout the tavern, drawing in more and more of the locals. Eventually, the local town watch has to intervene, dragging everyone outside. Eventually, the local town watch has to intervene, dragging everyone outside. I, the man that bumped into me, and several others have taken some injuries in the fighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4425;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4426;At first, it is just me and the man that bumped into me that are fighting, but the fighting soon spreads throughout the tavern, drawing in more and more of the locals. Eventually, the local town watch has to intervene, dragging everyone outside. By that point, I have been injured for life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4426;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4427;A messenger has arrived from the owner of a local tavern. The man is apparently quite upset with [From.GetBestName], as [From.GetSheHe] seems to have started a brawl the other night, and now demands that something is done about [From.GetBestName], as [From.GetSheHe] apprently has brawled before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4427;Brawls happen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4427;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4427;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4428;I have long known that [foreigners_target.GetBestName] has ambitions to become known as a great warrior, but though [foreigners_target.GetSheHe] certainly has some skill I feel that there are things I could teach [foreigners_target.GetHerHim], seeing as some of the techniques familiar to me might be useful against opponents that have never encountered them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4428;Let me teach you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4429;[From.GetBestName] approached me today, suggesting that [From.GetSheHe] could teach me a few fighting moves unlike anything I am familiar with. Given that [From.GetSheHe] is a foreigner, it is quite likely that [From.GetSheHe] knows some exotic techniques, but it would perhaps be a bit embarrassing to get a lesson from [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4429;I accept your help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4429;I don't need your help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4430;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have been seen practicing swordfighting together. It seems [FromFrom.GetBestName] was the teacher, which is a bit odd, but [From.GetBestName] apparently was content with that arrangement, and [From.GetSheHe] might have learned some foreign tricks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4430;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4431;One day when I am visiting a local market some of the locals ask me how I like it in the area. I tell them that I rather like it but that there are some things I rather miss from my home. This does not seem to be what they wanted to hear, as they get quite angry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4431;Maybe I misspoke...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4432;I have just received word that the peasants in [foreigners_target_province.GetName] have gotten restless as a result of [From.GetBestName]'s latest visit. Apparently, [From.GetBestName] said that [From.GetSheHe] wished for dishonor on the peasants, their whole families, and their cows, as well as several other insulting things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4432;Ignore the peasant rabble!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4432;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4432;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4433;[From.GetBestName] has always implied that [From.GetSheHe] possesses quite a bit of useful knowledge from back where [From.GetSheHe] originally came from, even if [From.GetSheHe] rarely has shown this to be true. However, today [From.GetSheHe] proved [From.GetHerHis] knowledge by offering several useful suggestions during a meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4433;That was helpful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4434;One day when I am in the company of [foreigners_target.GetBestName] I realize that there are things that I know that [foreigners_target.GetSheHe] does not. Perhaps it would be wise to share those insights, seeing as I am a guest in this foreign land?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4434;Let me teach you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4435;One day when I am in the company of [From.GetBestName] [From.GetSheHe] suggests that perhaps [From.GetSheHe] could be permitted to share some insights regarding some matters that [From.GetSheHe] picked up some useful knowledge about back home. Perhaps it would be embarrassing to accept, but it might also be useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4435;I accept your help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4435;I don't need your help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4436;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] apparently has been taught some things by [FromFrom.GetBestName] as [From.GetSheHe] apparently did not know as much as the foreigner. I am sure that there are those that would consider the need for such a lesson embarrassing, but maybe such knowledge is worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4436;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4437;My experiences while staying at the court of [foreigners_host.GetBestName] have been many, and some of them have taught me quite a few things. I have been composing a book about some of those things for a while, and today I finished the final draft to present to [foreigners_host.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4437;I dedicate this to you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4438;[From.GetBestName] sought an audience today, which you decide to grant. To my surprise, [From.GetSheHe] presented a book to me, which [From.GetSheHe] apparently has been working on for some time. Skimming through it rather quickly, I easily conclude that [From.GetBestName]'s talents lie elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4438;I accept your gift!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4438;You can keep it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4439;[From.GetBestName] sought an audience today, which you decide to grant. To my surprise, [From.GetSheHe] presented a book to me, which [From.GetSheHe] apparently has been working on for some time. Skimming through it rather quickly, I easily conclude that [From.GetBestName] is a decently talented author.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4439;I accept your gift!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4439;You can keep it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4440;[From.GetBestName] sought an audience today, which you decide to grant. To my surprise, [From.GetSheHe] presented a book to me, which [From.GetSheHe] apparently has been working on for some time. Skimming through it rather quickly, I easily conclude that [From.GetBestName] definitely knows quite a lot about writing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4440;I accept your gift!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4440;You can keep it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4441;[foreigners_target.GetBestName] has long expressed an interest in the ways of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith and just what [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] expects of the faithful. I have done my best to answer the questions I have been asked, and it seems to have paid off, seeing as [foreigners_target.GetSheHe] has seen fit to convert.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4441;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4442;Today I learned that [foreigners_target.GetBestName] has seen fit to convert to the [From.Religion.GetName] due to the actions of [From.GetBestName]. This conversion certainly is not to the liking of everyone, and it is up to me to decide how to handle the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4442;[From.GetSheHeCap] did the right thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4442;I will ignore it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4442;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4442;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4443;It seems the inhabitants of [foreigners_target_province.GetName] have taken an interest in [From.GetBestName] and [From.GetHerHis] ways, as the majority has seen fit to convert to the [From.Religion.GetName] faith. Some people at my court are outraged by this, and I have to decide how to handle the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4443;[From.GetSheHeCap] did the right thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4443;I will ignore it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4443;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4443;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4444;As I am a foreigner at the court of [foreigners_host.GetBestName] there are many that consider me utterly irrelevant and that perhaps underestimate me. As a result, people are sometimes careless around me, and that has allowed me to notice that some people, such as [foreigners_target.GetBestName], are up to unsavory things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4444;I saw that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4445;It seems [From.GetBestName], the shipwrecked foreigner who has been living at [foreigners_host.GetBestName]'s court for some time, is paying more attention to what goes on than you would have expected, as [From.GetSheHe] apparently has noticed my plot and has seen fit to tell [foreigners_host.GetBestName] all about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4445;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4446;[FromFrom.GetBestName] sought an audience with me today, wishing to speak to me about [From.GetBestName]. Once the two of us were in private, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] shared some information [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has managed to uncover concerning a plot that [From.GetBestName] is involved in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4446;Good to know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4447;Many of the courtiers at [foreigners_host.GetBestName]'s court are quite wealthy, and some of them are a bit careless when it comes to ensuring that it is impossible to get into their quarters, including [foreigners_target.GetBestName]. Anyone could break in and take what is there...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4447;I will take what I can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4448;It is a simple enough matter to enter into [foreigners_target.GetBestName]'s quarters, and once inside it does not take me long to locate some valuables. While it was tempting to take some of the more unique items I found inside, I realized that it would be harder to prove anything if I only took money, and I decided that it was unwise to risk anything else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4448;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4449;It is a simple enough matter to enter into [foreigners_target.GetBestName]'s quarters, and once inside it does not take me long to locate some valuables. However, before I can take them [foreigners_target.GetBestName] returns, catching me inside [foreigners_target.GetHerHis] room and demanding that I leave at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4449;I must have gotten lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4450;[foreigners_target.GetBestName] has publicly accused [From.GetBestName] of breaking into [foreigners_target.GetHerHis] quarters, supposedly for no good reason. [From.GetBestName] has come up with several excuses for having been there, but they all are a bit contradictory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4450;It was probably a misunderstanding...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4450;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4450;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4451;Many of the vassals visiting [foreigners_host.GetBestName]'s court are quite wealthy, and some of them are a bit careless when it comes to ensuring that it is impossible to get into their quarters, including [foreigners_target.GetBestName]. Anyone could break in and take what is there...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4451;I will take what I can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4452;It is a simple enough matter to enter into [foreigners_target.GetBestName]'s quarters, and once inside it does not take me long to locate some valuables. While it was tempting to take some of the more unique items I found inside, I realized that it would be harder to prove anything if I only took money, and I decided that it was unwise to risk anything else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4452;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4453;As I return to your quarters I realize that someone has been inside and that some of the money I had left there is missing. Asking around, nobody seems to have seen anyone nearby, and I resign yourself to the fact that the thief probably never will be caught.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4453;Who could have done this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4454;It is a simple enough matter to enter into [foreigners_target.GetBestName]'s quarters, and once inside it does not take me long to locate some valuables. However, before I can depart [foreigners_target.GetBestName]'s guards return, catching me inside [foreigners_target.GetHerHis] quarters and easily subduing and imprisoning me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4454;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4455;As I return to my quarters I send in my guards ahead of me to look for any possible threats lurking inside. To my surprise, they soon drag out [From.GetBestName], who apparently was in the process of stealing some of the valuables inside. As it is clear that [From.GetSheHe] had no reason to be there, I order [From.GetHerHim] thrown in a cell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4455;You deserve no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4456;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] has imprisoned [FromFrom.GetBestName] after catching [FromFrom.GetHerHim] in the middle of an attempt to steal some valuables from inside [From.GetHerHis] personal quarters. I can see no real reason to interfere in the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4456;Thieves must be punished...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4457;There are many attractive people at the court of [foreigners_host.GetBestName], but of late my attention has primarily turned to [foreigners_target.GetBestName]. [foreigners_target.GetSheHeCap] certainly is an intriguing [foreigners_target.GetManWoman], and it might be interesting to get to know [foreigners_target.GetHerHim] more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4457;I will make an attempt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4457;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4458;Today I was approached by [From.GetBestName], the shipwrecked foreigner who has been living at the court of [foreigners_host.GetBestName] for some time. [From.GetSheHeCap] made it quite clear that [From.GetSheHe] wishes to get to know me more intimately, and that [From.GetSheHe] knows of a secluded place nearby...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4458;I like the way you think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4458;You and me? Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4459;[From.GetBestName] was not as receptive to the suggestion that the two of us should leave for some place more private so that we could get to know each other intimately as I would have hoped, and has made it clear that [From.GetSheHe] does not wish for me to bring up the matter again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4459;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4460;[From.GetBestName] was as receptive to my suggestion that the two of us should leave for some place more private so that we could get to know each other intimately as I had hoped, and it was not terribly difficult to find such a place. Some time later, as we are getting dressed, the matter of the future is brought up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4460;We should do this again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4460;It won't happen again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4461;There are many attractive people in the realm of [foreigners_host.GetBestName], but of late my attention has primarily turned to [foreigners_target.GetBestName]. [foreigners_target.GetSheHeCap] certainly is an intriguing [foreigners_target.GetManWoman], and it might be interesting to get to know [foreigners_target.GetHerHim] more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4461;I will make an attempt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4461;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4462;Today I was approached by [From.GetBestName], the shipwrecked foreigner who has been living at the court of [foreigners_host.GetBestName] for some time. [From.GetSheHeCap] made it quite clear that [From.GetSheHe] wishes to get to know me more intimately, and that [From.GetSheHe] knows of a secluded place nearby...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4462;I like the way you think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4462;You and me? Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4463;[From.GetBestName] was not as receptive to my suggestion that the two of us should leave for some place more private so that we could get to know each other intimately as I would have hoped, and has made it clear that [From.GetSheHe] does not wish for me to ever bring up the matter again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4463;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4464;[From.GetBestName] was as receptive to my suggestion that the two of us should leave for some place more private so that we could get to know each other intimately as I had hoped, and it was not terribly difficult to find such a place. Some time later, as we are getting dressed, the matter of the future is brought up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4464;We should do this again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4464;It won't happen again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4465;I and [From.GetBestName] share a rather enjoyable time together away from the eyes of all others. When we are getting dressed again we discuss the matter of what happens next, and [From.GetSheHe] suggests that we should meet again as soon as it can be arranged, seeing as we both had a good time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4465;I look forward to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4466;I and [From.GetBestName] share a rather enjoyable time together away from the eyes of all others. When we are getting dressed again we discuss the matter of what happens next, and [From.GetSheHe] suggests that we should not make a habit out of it, seeing as it sooner or later would attract attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4466;Maybe for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4467;The foreigner, [From.GetBestName], has been visiting [foreigners_target_province.GetName] frequently over the past month, making some small investments and suggesting how the locals can improve things in various areas. It is already starting to yield some promising results, as best I can tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4467;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4468;One day when I am in the company of [foreigners_target.GetBestName] I forget just what the proper etiquette for that situation would be and make a mess of the situation. I try to smooth things over, but it becomes clear that it will take time before my careless words are forgiven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4468;That could have gone better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4469;I spent some time with [From.GetBestName], the shipwrecked foreigner living at [foreigners_host.GetBestName]'s court, today, and though [From.GetSheHe] usually knows what not to do [From.GetSheHe] was rather careless as [From.GetSheHe] spoke today, and some things [From.GetSheHe] said were quite insulting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4469;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4470;It seems [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been causing trouble recently, seeing as [From.GetBestName] has been heard complaining about [FromFrom.GetHerHim] insulting [From.GetHerHim]. Normally, this would not concern me, but as [FromFrom.GetBestName] is a shipwrecked foreigner living at my court [FromFrom.GetHerHis] actions reflect poorly on me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4470;It was probably a misunderstanding...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4470;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4470;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4471;One day when I am in the company of [foreigners_target.GetBestName] I forget just what the proper etiquette for that situation would be and make a mess of the situation. I try to smooth things over, but it becomes clear that it will take time before your careless words are forgiven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4471;That could have gone better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4472;I spent some time with [From.GetBestName], the shipwrecked foreigner living at [foreigners_host.GetBestName]'s court, today, and though [From.GetSheHe] usually knows what not to do [From.GetSheHe] was rather careless as [From.GetSheHe] spoke today, and some things [From.GetSheHe] said were quite insulting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4472;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4473;It seems [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been causing trouble recently as [From.GetBestName] has been heard complaining about [FromFrom.GetHerHim] insulting [From.GetHerHim].

EVTOPTA_SOH_4474;I will let this slide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4474;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4474;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4475;Though it never seemed particularly likely to me that [From.GetBestName] would be as useful to me as someone not from a foreign land [From.GetSheHe] has proven to be even less useful than I expected. It is quite embarrassing, really, to have seen fit to keep [From.GetHerHim] around in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4475;Not everything goes as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4476;Unlike most people, I am meant for great things, or so the voices only I can hear tell me. Now [foreigners_target.GetBestName] has become a threat to my destiny, and [foreigners_target.GetSheHe] needs to be removed without delay, or so the voices tell me at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4476;As the voices command!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4477;One evening as I am about to fall asleep I hear movement inside my quarters. Turning towards the sound, I discover [From.GetBestName] standing over me, a dagger at the ready. [From.GetSheHeCap] moves to attack me before I can react, and by the time the guards arrive it is much too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4477;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4478;I have received word that [From.GetBestName] was murdered in [From.GetHerHis] bed by none other than [FromFrom.GetBestName], who was caught at the scene. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] does not deny it, and instead merely claims that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] did what the voices told [FromFrom.GetHerHim] to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4478;I will let this slide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4478;Throw [FromFrom.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

[From.GetSheHeCap] moves to attack me, but luckily enough I manage to keep [From.GetHerHim] at bay until the guards can arrive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4479;I barely survived...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4480;I have received word that [From.GetBestName] almost was murdered in [From.GetHerHis] bed by none other than [FromFrom.GetBestName], who was caught at the scene. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] does not deny it, and instead merely claims that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] did what the voices told [FromFrom.GetHerHim] to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_4481;The voices are restless today. They tell me that it is a time for change. At first, I have trouble realizing what they mean, but then I realize that it is time for me to become a [foreigners_target_province.Culture.GetName] [foreigners_target_province.Religion.GetName], as that is what the voices desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4481;New day, new me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4482;I have long suspected that [From.GetBestName] is not quite right in the head, and this suspicion only grew stronger after I met [From.GetHerHim] today. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] has decided that [From.GetSheHe] now will adhere to the customs of the [From.Culture.GetName] and the teachings of the [From.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4482;How does that make sense?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4483;[From.GetBestName] has been at me court for quite some time now, and has shown an interest in local customs and beliefs almost since [From.GetSheHe] arrived. Today I learned that [From.GetSheHe] finally has seen fit to embrace the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith and all of its teachings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4483;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_4484;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4486;Today I was approached by [From.GetBestName], the shipwrecked foreigner who has been living at my court for a while. [From.GetSheHeCap] told me that [From.GetSheHe] wishes to get married, and that [From.GetSheHe] ideally wants to marry [foreigners_choice.GetBestName] as they already are quite close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4486;I think you two belong together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4486;You should marry my family!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4486;You should marry a servant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4486;Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4487;Today I was approached by [From.GetBestName], the shipwrecked foreigner who has been living at my court for a while. [From.GetSheHeCap] told me that [From.GetSheHe] wishes to get married, but that [From.GetSheHe] has not found a suitable spouse yet, and that my help would be most appreciated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4487;I have a candidate in mind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4487;You should marry my family!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
