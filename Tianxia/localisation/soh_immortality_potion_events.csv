EVTDESC_SOH_11801;[FromFrom.GetBestName] has requested that I begin brewing an immortality potion for [FromFrom.GetHerHim], seeing as I am [FromFrom.GetHerHis] Court Alchemist. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] clearly believes that such things are possible for an alchemist such as me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_11853;It's fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11853;I need to try to salvage this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11854;It took some thought and some work, but I managed to devise a method to successfully extract the unwanted ingredient from the immortality potion. It is at least as good as it was before I made the mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11854;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11855;My attempt to extract the unwanted ingredient from the immortality potion did not go well, and in fact I think I managed to make it worse than if I had simply let the potion be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11855;What is done is done...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_11856;I have some [GetTargetImmortalityPotionIngredient] in my laboratory, as well as the immortality potion that I am brewing. Many would think me mad to add that ingredient to the potion, but I could show them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_11856;I could show them ALL!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCA_SOH_11858;I know where [From.GetBestName]'s alchemical laboratory is located, and know that [From.GetSheHe] is brewing an immortality potion inside it. If I wanted to, I could attempt to make sure the potion does not end up working out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCA_SOH_11859;As I returned to my alchemical laboratory today I discovered signs that someone else had been inside it, even though I had left strict instructions for everyone to stay out of it.

EVTOPTB_SOH_11861;I want [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11862;I am starting to have second thoughts about the immortality potion that I am brewing. I might be wrong, but I feel as if it might not be turning out the way I was hoping that it would, and a flawed immortality potion might end up killing me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SOH_11862;Better to stop now and try again later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11863;I am starting to have second thoughts about the immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName].

EVTOPTA_SOH_11863;I can make it work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11863;I should stop, even if [getting_immortality_potion.GetFirstName] might not like it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11863;A deadly potion sounds excellent to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11864;I have just received a message from [From.GetBestName] telling me that [From.GetSheHe] has decided to stop brewing the immortality potion that I requested from [From.GetHerHim]. Apparently [From.GetSheHe] was feeling quite uncertain about its quality and decided that it was safest to stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11864;Perhaps for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11864;I don't believe [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11865;[From.GetBestName] was not happy with the news, but [From.GetSheHe] has not made a big deal of me deciding to stop brewing the immortality potion that [From.GetSheHe] requested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11865;That's good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11866;[From.GetBestName] was not happy with the news, and it seems [From.GetSheHe] did not trust my explanation. In fact, [From.GetSheHe] might be considering the act nothing short of a crime against [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11866;Not what I was hoping for...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11867;I do not particularly like [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName], and the thought of helping [getting_immortality_potion.GetHerHim] become immortal does not sit too well with me. And yet I am brewing an immortality potion for [getting_immortality_potion.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11867;I made a promise...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11867;I should stop and make up an excuse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11867;Perhaps I could turn it into a poison...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11868;I need to decide on a recipe to use for the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. I could try to come up with something on my own, but perhaps there are other options that might be better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11868;My knowledge is surely sufficient!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11868;I think I have some books that might help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11868;My agents will find the best option!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11869;I had little trouble coming up with some options for the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName], and after carefully evaluating the options I have decided on the recipe to use for it. I have a good feeling about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SOH_11869;My knowledge will serve me well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11870;I managed to come up with a few options for the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. They are not guaranteed to pan out, but they feel like a very reasonable starting point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11870;I will figure out the details later!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11871;I came up with one option for the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. I do not know if it is a good one, but it is surely better than nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11871;The prize is worth the risk!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11872;I have not managed to come up with any particular ideas for the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. I suppose I might have to figure out what to do later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11872;I hope I will figure it out...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11873;After spending some time reading several books on alchemy I have determined that there is one recipe that feels very promising for the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11873;Time well spent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11874;I have discovered some clues as to how to brew a working supposed immortality potion in my books, which will help me with the one that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. Some details are still missing, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11874;It is a starting point, at least!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11875;My books contained a few mentions of supposed immortality potions, but I have not really found any solid ideas for how to succeed with the one I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. Continuing would be risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11875;Risky or not, I will continue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11876;I could have sworn that my books contained some mentions of supposed immortality potions and how to brew them, but I found no information at all aside from mentions of past failures. Hardly a promising start for the one I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11876;I can figure it out later!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11877;My agents have managed to track down a plethora of clues as to how I might succeed with the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11877;They have served me well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11878;I have received some decent clues as to how to brew a working supposed immortality potion from my agents. They might serve as a starting point for the one that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11878;I should be able to make it work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11879;The information that my agents have brought to me is contradictory, and even the most promising pieces do not seem very promising. I have little to go on when it comes to brewing a supposed immortality potion for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11879;The rest can be figured out later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11880;Several of my agents have gone missing without a trace, and the ones that have returned or sent word have not found anything of use. If I truly want to brew a supposed immortality potion for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName], I will have to figure things out along the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11880;I guess I can continue anyway...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11882;I have figured out the next ingredient that I need for the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] - some [GetTargetImmortalityPotionIngredient] - and happen to have some of it in my possession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11882;I will add it to the potion right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11883;I have figured out the next ingredient that I need for the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] - some [GetImmortalityPotionIngredient] - and now need to acquire it. Perhaps [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] could be of assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11883;I should ask!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11884;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] needs some [From.GetImmortalityPotionIngredient] for the immortality potion that [From.GetSheHe] is brewing for me. It is clear [From.GetSheHe] is hoping that I will provide the ingredient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11884;I can provide the ingredient you need!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11884;I can pay for the ingredient you need!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11884;Your job, your problem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11885;[From.GetBestName] has seen fit to provide me with the [GetImmortalityPotionIngredient] that I need for the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11885;I will add it to the potion right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11886;[From.GetBestName] has seen fit to provide me with the funds required to purchase the [GetImmortalityPotionIngredient] that I need for the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11886;I will purchase it right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11887;It seems [From.GetBestName] is unwilling to assist me when it comes to the acquisition of the [GetImmortalityPotionIngredient] that I need for [From.GetHerHis] supposed immortality potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11887;Does [From.GetSheHe] perhaps suspect something?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11888;I have figured out the next ingredient that I need for the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] - some [GetImmortalityPotionIngredient] - and now need to acquire it somehow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11888;I will need to figure something out...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11890;I have finally found the [GetTargetImmortalityPotionIngredient] that I need for the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11890;Time to make use of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11891;Just as I am about to add the [GetTargetImmortalityPotionIngredient] to the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] I remember that it might give rise to some unwanted side-effects. I might need to purify it before using it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11891;I will attempt to purify it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11891;I think I can use it safely...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11892;It took me some work, but I have managed to purify the [GetPurifiedImmortalityPotionIngredient]. It should now be safe to use in the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName], or at least considerably less harmful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11892;I knew I could do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11893;My attempt to purify some [GetPurifiedImmortalityPotionIngredient] for the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] has failed, and the [GetPurifiedImmortalityPotionIngredient] is likely even less healthy now. I am unsure what to do with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11893;I can stil make use of it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11893;I need to acquire more [GetPurifiedImmortalityPotionIngredient]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11894;There is doubtlessly advice as to how to brew a supposed immortality potion in the [target_alchemy_book.GetName]. I should make use of it so that the potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] turns out even better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11894;Knowledge is power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11895;There are books about alchemy that I do not possess that might be useful when it comes to brewing the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. Perhaps [getting_immortality_potion.GetSheHe] could help me acquire one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11895;It wouldn't hurt to ask...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11895;I can make do without it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11896;[From.GetBestName] has let me know that there are some books about alchemy that [From.GetSheHe] does not possess that might be of use when it comes to the immortality potion that [From.GetSheHe] is brewing for me, and is asking if I could assit in the acquisition of such a book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11896;You can have mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11896;I can give you the money to purchase it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11896;You'll have to get it on your own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11897;[From.GetBestName] has seen fit to provide me with [From.GetHerHis] own copy of the [target_alchemy_book.GetName], which is a better outcome than I had hoped for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11897;This will be most useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11898;[From.GetBestName] has provided me with sufficient funds to purchase a book that might help me with the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11898;I'll purchase the book right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11898;Actually, I think I will keep the money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11899;[From.GetBestName] has proven unwilling to assist me when it comes to the acquisition of a new book about alchemy, even though it would be useful when it comes to the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11899;The quality of the potion might suffer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_11901;I don't think it would hurt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11901;I have other plans for that ingredient...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11902;Disaster! Some of the notes concerning the next steps when it comes to the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] have gone missing, whether due to me misplacing them or something else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] did not trust my motives, perhaps [From.GetSheHe] was unwilling to owe me a Favor, or perhaps [From.GetSheHe] simply thinks this is something [From.GetSheHe] needs to do on [From.GetHerHis] own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11909;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11910;[From.GetBestName] has offered to provide some useful insights into how I could make the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] turn out even better, provided I consider it repayment of the Favor I am owed by [From.GetHerHim]. I do not know if [From.GetSheHe] is speaking truthfully or perhaps has ulterior motives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11910;Your terms are acceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11910;Thank you, but no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11911;[From.GetBestName] was quite eager to accept my help with the immortality potion that [From.GetSheHe] is brewing for [From.getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName], and quite willing to consider the Favor I owed [From.GetHerHim] repaid in return. Now I need to decide whether I am actually aiming to help ensure that it turns out as expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11911;I will help [From.GetHerHim] succeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11911;[From.GetSheHeCap] was a fool to trust me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11912;[From.GetBestName] turned down my offer to help with the immortality potion that [From.GetSheHe] is brewing for [From.getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] did not trust my motives, perhaps [From.GetSheHe] wants something else as the Favor [From.GetSheHe] is owed, or perhaps [From.GetSheHe] simply thinks this is something [From.GetSheHe] needs to do on [From.GetHerHis] own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11912;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11913;[From.GetBestName] has offered to provide some useful insights into how I could make the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] turn out even better, provided I pay [From.GetHerHim].

EVTOPTA_SOH_11913;Your terms are acceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11913;Thank you, but no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11914;[From.GetBestName] was quite eager to accept my help with the immortality potion that [From.GetSheHe] is brewing for [From.getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName], even though I asked for money in return. Now I need to decide whether I am actually aiming to help ensure that it turns out as expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11914;I will help [From.GetHerHim] succeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11914;[From.GetSheHeCap] was a fool to trust me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11915;[From.GetBestName] turned down my offer to help with the immortality potion that [From.GetSheHe] is brewing for [From.getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] did not trust my motives, perhaps [From.GetSheHe] is unwilling to part with [From.GetHerHis] money, or perhaps [From.GetSheHe] simply thinks this is something [From.GetSheHe] needs to do on [From.GetHerHis] own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11915;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11916;I was a bit lost in thought as I was working in my laboratory today and accidentally put some [GetTargetImmortalityPotionIngredient] in the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName], even though that was not the ingredient that I wanted to add.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11916;It's fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11916;I need to try to salvage this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11917;It took some thought and some work, but I managed to devise a method to successfully extract the unwanted ingredient from the supposed immortality potion. It is at least as good as it was before I made the mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11917;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11918;My attempt to extract the unwanted ingredient from the supposed immortality potion did not go well, and in fact I think I managed to make it worse than if I had simply let the potion be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11918;What is done is done...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11919;I have some [GetTargetImmortalityPotionIngredient] in my laboratory, as well as the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. Many would think me mad to add that ingredient to the potion, but I could show them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11919;I could show them ALL!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11919;I could... actually follow my original plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11920;The voices are all in agreement, for once. The [GetTargetImmortalityPotionIngredient]. I must put it in the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11920;It must be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11921;I know where [From.GetBestName]'s alchemical laboratory is located, and know that [From.GetSheHe] is brewing an immortality potion for [From.getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] inside it. If I wanted to, I could attempt to make sure the potion does not end up working out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11921;[From.GetHerHisCap] potion must be sabotaged!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11921;I will leave it well enough alone...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11922;As I returned to my alchemical laboratory today I discovered signs that someone else had been inside it, even though I had left strict instructions for everyone to stay out of it. Even worse, the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] seems to have changed its color noticeably. Someone has added something to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11922;Who could have done this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11923;Just as I was about to pour some various things into the immortality potion [FromFrom.GetBestName] is brewing for [FromFrom.getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] a couple of guards seized me from behind. Escape proved to be impossible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11923;Not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11924;Two of my guards just dragged [From.GetBestName] before me. They tell me that they caught [From.GetHerHim] as [From.GetSheHe] was attempting to pour something into the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] in my alchemical laboratory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11924;This will not be forgotten!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11924;I want [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11925;I am starting to have second thoughts about the supposed immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. I might be wrong, but I feel as if it might not be turning out the way I was hoping that it would, and a flawed potion might end up killing the person that drinks it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11925;I can make it work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11925;I should stop, even if [getting_immortality_potion.GetFirstName] might not like it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11925;A deadly potion sounds excellent to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11926;I have just received a message from [From.GetBestName] telling me that [From.GetSheHe] has decided to stop brewing the immortality potion that I requested from [From.GetHerHim]. Apparently [From.GetSheHe] was feeling quite uncertain about its quality and decided that it was safest to stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11926;Perhaps for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11926;I don't believe [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11927;[From.GetBestName] was not happy with the news, but [From.GetSheHe] has not made a big deal of me deciding to stop brewing the immortality potion that [From.GetSheHe] requested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11927;That's good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11928;[From.GetBestName] was not happy with the news, and it seems [From.GetSheHe] did not trust my explanation. In fact, [From.GetSheHe] might be considering the act nothing short of a crime against [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11928;Not what I was hoping for...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11929;I do not particularly like [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName], and the thought of helping [getting_immortality_potion.GetHerHim] become immortal does not sit too well with me. And yet I am brewing a supposed immortality potion for [getting_immortality_potion.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11929;It's not like I'm making a real one...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11929;I should stop and make up an excuse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11929;Perhaps I could turn it into a poison...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11930;While I might not have felt that attempting to brew a proper immortality potion for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] was the right decision when I started, I am having second thoughts. Perhaps I could salvage the potion and actually help [getting_immortality_potion.GetHerHim] become immortal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11930;I can't turn back now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11930;I will attempt to salvage it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11932;I need to decide on a recipe to use for the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. I could try to come up with something on my own, but perhaps there are other options that might be better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11932;My knowledge is surely sufficient!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11932;I think I have some books that might help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11932;My agents will find the best option!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11933;I had little trouble coming up with some options for the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName], and after carefully evaluating the options I have decided on the recipe to use for it. I have a good feeling about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_SOH_11933;My knowledge will serve me well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11934;I managed to come up with a few options for the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. They are not guaranteed to pan out, but they feel like a very reasonable starting point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11934;I will figure out the details later!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11935;I came up with one option for the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. I do not know if it is a good one, but it is surely better than nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11935;The prize is worth the risk!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11936;I have not managed to come up with any particular ideas for the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. I suppose I might have to figure out what to do later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11936;I hope I will figure it out...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11937;After spending some time reading several books on alchemy I have determined that there is one recipe that feels very promising for the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11937;Time well spent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11938;I have discovered some clues as to how to brew a working poison disguised as an immortality potion in my books, which will help me with the one that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. Some details are still missing, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11938;It is a starting point, at least!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11939;My books contained a few mentions of poison disguised as an immortality potions, but I have not really found any solid ideas for how to succeed with the one I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. Continuing would be risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11939;Risky or not, I will continue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11940;I could have sworn that my books contained some mentions of poison disguised as an immortality potions and how to brew them, but I found no information at all aside from mentions of past failures. Hardly a promising start for the one I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11940;I can figure it out later!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11941;My agents have managed to track down a plethora of clues as to how I might succeed with the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11941;They have served me well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11942;I have received some decent clues as to how to brew a working poison disguised as an immortality potion from my agents. They might serve as a starting point for the one that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11942;I should be able to make it work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11943;The information that my agents have brought to me is contradictory, and even the most promising pieces do not seem very promising. I have little to go on when it comes to brewing a poison disguised as an immortality potion for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11943;The rest can be figured out later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11944;Several of my agents have gone missing without a trace, and the ones that have returned or sent word have not found anything of use. If I truly want to brew a poison disguised as an immortality potion for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName], I will have to figure things out along the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11944;I guess I can continue anyway...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11946;I have figured out the next ingredient that I need for the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] - some [GetTargetImmortalityPotionIngredient] - and happen to have some of it in my possession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11946;I will add it to the potion right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11947;I have figured out the next ingredient that I need for the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] - some [GetImmortalityPotionIngredient] - and now need to acquire it. Perhaps [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] could be of assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11947;I should ask!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11948;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] needs some [From.GetImmortalityPotionIngredient] for the immortality potion that [From.GetSheHe] is brewing for me. It is clear [From.GetSheHe] is hoping that I will provide the ingredient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11948;I can provide the ingredient you need!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11948;I can pay for the ingredient you need!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11948;Your job, your problem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11949;[From.GetBestName] has seen fit to provide me with the [GetImmortalityPotionIngredient] that I need for the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11949;I will add it to the potion right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11950;[From.GetBestName] has seen fit to provide me with the funds required to purchase the [GetImmortalityPotionIngredient] that I need for the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11950;I will purchase it right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11951;It seems [From.GetBestName] is unwilling to assist me when it comes to the acquisition of the [GetImmortalityPotionIngredient] that I need for [From.GetHerHis] poison disguised as an immortality potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11951;What does [From.GetSheHe] know, or suspect?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11952;I have figured out the next ingredient that I need for the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] - some [GetImmortalityPotionIngredient] - and now need to acquire it somehow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11952;I will need to figure something out...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11954;I have finally found the [GetTargetImmortalityPotionIngredient] that I need for the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11954;Time to make use of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11955;Just as I am about to add the [GetTargetImmortalityPotionIngredient] to the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] I remember that it might be hard to use it to cause harm without first purifying it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11955;I will attempt to purify it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11955;I think I can use it safely...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11956;It took me some work, but I have managed to purify the [GetPurifiedImmortalityPotionIngredient]. It should now be safe to use in the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName], or at least considerably less harmful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11956;I knew I could do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11957;My attempt to purify some [GetPurifiedImmortalityPotionIngredient] for the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] has failed, and the [GetPurifiedImmortalityPotionIngredient] is likely even less healthy now. I am unsure what to do with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11957;I can stil make use of it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11957;I need to acquire more [GetPurifiedImmortalityPotionIngredient]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11958;There is doubtlessly advice as to how to brew a poison disguised as an immortality potion in the [target_alchemy_book.GetName]. I should make use of it so that the potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] turns out even better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11958;Knowledge is power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11959;There are books about alchemy that I do not possess that might be useful when it comes to brewing the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. Perhaps [getting_immortality_potion.GetSheHe] could help me acquire one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11959;It wouldn't hurt to ask...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11959;I can make do without it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11960;[From.GetBestName] has let me know that there are some books about alchemy that [From.GetSheHe] does not possess that might be of use when it comes to the immortality potion that [From.GetSheHe] is brewing for me, and is asking if I could assit in the acquisition of such a book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11960;You can have mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11960;I can give you the money to purchase it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11960;You'll have to get it on your own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11961;[From.GetBestName] has seen fit to provide me with [From.GetHerHis] own copy of the [target_alchemy_book.GetName], which is a better outcome than I had hoped for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11961;This will be most useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11962;[From.GetBestName] has provided me with sufficient funds to purchase a book that might help me with the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11962;I'll purchase the book right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11962;Actually, I think I will keep the money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11963;[From.GetBestName] has proven unwilling to assist me when it comes to the acquisition of a new book about alchemy, even though it would be useful when it comes to the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11963;The quality of the potion might suffer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11964;I have learned of a book about alchemy that I do not possess that might be quite useful when it comes to the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11964;I will purchase it at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11964;I can make do without it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11965;Though it is not something I initially had considered adding to the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName], I have some [GetTargetImmortalityPotionIngredient] in my possession that I perhaps could add to the potion. It might help, or it might not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11965;I don't think it would hurt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11965;I have other plans for that ingredient...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11966;Disaster! Some of the notes concerning the next steps when it comes to the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] have gone missing, whether due to me misplacing them or something else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11966;I think I remember what they said!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11966;I need to proceed very carefully...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11967;[From.GetBestName] is in the middle of brewing an immortality potion for [From.getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. Perhaps I could offer some insights in order to ensure that it does not turn out in a fashion that I would not like.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11967;I will ask for nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11967;I would consider it a Favor...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11967;If [From.GetSheHe] considers it a Favor repaid...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_11967;If I get paid, of course...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_11975;[From.GetBestName] was quite eager to accept my help with the immortality potion that [From.GetSheHe] is brewing for [From.getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName], and quite willing to consider the Favor I owed [From.GetHerHim] repaid in return. Now I need to decide whether I am actually aiming to help ensure that it turns out as expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11975;I will help [From.GetHerHim] succeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11975;[From.GetSheHeCap] was a fool to trust me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11976;[From.GetBestName] turned down my offer to help with the immortality potion that [From.GetSheHe] is brewing for [From.getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] did not trust my motives, perhaps [From.GetSheHe] wants something else as the Favor [From.GetSheHe] is owed, or perhaps [From.GetSheHe] simply thinks this is something [From.GetSheHe] needs to do on [From.GetHerHis] own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11976;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11977;[From.GetBestName] has offered to provide some useful insights into how I could make the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] turn out even better, provided I pay [From.GetHerHim]. I do not know if [From.GetSheHe] is speaking truthfully or perhaps has ulterior motives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11977;Your terms are acceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11977;Thank you, but no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11978;[From.GetBestName] was quite eager to accept my help with the immortality potion that [From.GetSheHe] is brewing for [From.getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName], even though I asked for money in return. Now I need to decide whether I am actually aiming to help ensure that it turns out as expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11978;I will help [From.GetHerHim] succeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11978;[From.GetSheHeCap] was a fool to trust me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11979;[From.GetBestName] turned down my offer to help with the immortality potion that [From.GetSheHe] is brewing for [From.getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] did not trust my motives, perhaps [From.GetSheHe] is unwilling to part with [From.GetHerHis] money, or perhaps [From.GetSheHe] simply thinks this is something [From.GetSheHe] needs to do on [From.GetHerHis] own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11979;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11980;I was a bit lost in thought as I was working in my laboratory today and accidentally put some [GetTargetImmortalityPotionIngredient] in the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName], even though that was not the ingredient that I wanted to add.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11980;It's fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11980;I need to try to salvage this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11981;It took some thought and some work, but I managed to devise a method to successfully extract the unwanted ingredient from the poison disguised as an immortality potion. It is at least as good as it was before I made the mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11981;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11982;My attempt to extract the unwanted ingredient from the poison disguised as an immortality potion did not go well, and in fact I think I managed to make it worse than if I had simply let the potion be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11982;What is done is done...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11983;I have some [GetTargetImmortalityPotionIngredient] in my laboratory, as well as the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. Many would think me mad to add that ingredient to the potion, but I could show them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11983;I could show them ALL!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11983;I could... actually follow my original plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11984;The voices are all in agreement, for once. The [GetTargetImmortalityPotionIngredient]. I must put it in the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11984;It must be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11985;I know where [From.GetBestName]'s alchemical laboratory is located, and know that [From.GetSheHe] is brewing an immortality potion for [From.getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] inside it. If I wanted to, I could attempt to make sure the potion does not end up working out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11985;[From.GetHerHisCap] potion must be sabotaged!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11985;I will leave it well enough alone...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11986;As I returned to my alchemical laboratory today I discovered signs that someone else had been inside it, even though I had left strict instructions for everyone to stay out of it. Even worse, the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] seems to have changed its color noticeably. Someone has added something to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11986;If only I knew who to thank!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11987;Just as I was about to pour some various things into the immortality potion [FromFrom.GetBestName] is brewing for [FromFrom.getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] a couple of guards seized me from behind. Escape proved to be impossible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11987;Not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11988;Two of my guards just dragged [From.GetBestName] before me. They tell me that they caught [From.GetHerHim] as [From.GetSheHe] was attempting to pour something into the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] in my alchemical laboratory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11988;[From.GetSheHeCap] should have been more discreet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11988;I want [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11989;I am starting to have second thoughts about the poison disguised as an immortality potion that I am brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. I might be wrong, but I feel as if it might not be turning out the way I was hoping that it would, and a flawed poison might actually help someone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11989;I can make it work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11989;I should stop, even if [getting_immortality_potion.GetFirstName] would never know the truth...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11989;Actually, that sounds great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11990;I have just received a message from [From.GetBestName] telling me that [From.GetSheHe] has decided to stop brewing the immortality potion that I requested from [From.GetHerHim]. Apparently [From.GetSheHe] was feeling quite uncertain about its quality and decided that it was safest to stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11990;Perhaps for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11990;I don't believe [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11991;[From.GetBestName] was not happy with the news, but [From.GetSheHe] has not made a big deal of me deciding to stop brewing the immortality potion that [From.GetSheHe] requested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11991;That's good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11992;[From.GetBestName] was not happy with the news, and it seems [From.GetSheHe] did not trust my explanation. In fact, [From.GetSheHe] might be considering the act nothing short of a crime against [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11992;Not what I was hoping for...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11993;While I might have felt that attempting to poison [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] was the right decision when I started brewing the supposed immortality potion, I am having second thoughts. Perhaps I could salvage the potion and actually help [getting_immortality_potion.GetHerHim] become immortal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11993;I can't turn back now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11993;I should tell [getting_immortality_potion.GetHerHim] I cannot finish the potion...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_11993;I will attempt to salvage it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11995;[giving_me_immortality_potion.GetBestName] has been brewing the immortality potion I asked [giving_me_immortality_potion.GetHerHim] for since quite far back now. I understand the process takes some time, and I do not want anything other than a working potion, but it has taken longer than I had expected it to take.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11995;[giving_me_immortality_potion.GetSheHeCap] is working hard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11995;I should ask [giving_me_immortality_potion.GetHerHim] about [giving_me_immortality_potion.GetHerHis] progress...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11996;[From.GetBestName] has asked me for a progress update for the immortality potion I have been brewing for [From.GetHerHim]. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] thinks that it is taking too long, or perhaps [From.GetSheHe] is merely curious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11996;It is going farily well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11996;I have had some trouble, to be honest...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11997;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetHerHis] work on the immortality potion is progressing farily well and that [From.GetSheHe] feels that [From.GetSheHe] has made about as much progress as [From.GetSheHe] had expected to have made at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11997;Carry on, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_11997;You should work faster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11998;[From.GetBestName] seemed satisfied with my reply, simply informing me that I should keep up the good work that I am doing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11998;That's good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_11999;[From.GetBestName] did not seem satisfied with my reply, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to inform me that I should pick up the pace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_11999;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12000;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] has not had an easy time brewing an immortality potion for me and that [From.GetSheHe] has suffered several setbacks. In short, things are not going as well as either of us would have hoped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12000;Disappointing, but not unexpected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12000;Work faster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_12000;Give me the potion, or there will be consequences!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12001;[From.GetBestName] did not seem happy with what I told [From.GetHerHim], but [From.GetSheHe] also did not seem entirely surprised. Still, I got the feeling that [From.GetSheHe] expected better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12001;Understandable, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12002;[From.GetBestName] took the time to tell me at length about how disappointed [From.GetSheHe] is with my lack of progress and how I should pick up the pace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12002;I know things are going slowly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12003;[From.GetBestName] did not care for what I told [From.GetHerHim] at all and told me I had better return with a finished immortality potion right away if I know what is good for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12003;It isn't ready yet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12003;Well, if you insist...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12004;Despite my ultimatum [From.GetBestName] has informed me that the immortality potion is not ready yet. [From.GetSheHeCap] further insists that it would be most unwise for me to attempt to consume [From.GetHerHis] potion at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12004;Well, I suppose you know best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12004;You, [From.GetFirstName], are a liar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12005;[From.GetBestName] changed [From.GetHerHis] mind about getting the immortality potion right away after I informed [From.GetHerHim] that it would be unwise to consume an incomplete potion. [From.GetSheHeCap] still seems unhappy, however, if perhaps a bit less so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12005;I can work with this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12006;[From.GetBestName] took my refusal to hand over the incomplete immortality potion poorly, informing me that I might as well have committed a crime against [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12006;This might be bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12007;[From.GetBestName] quickly fetched the immortality potion from [From.GetHerHis] laboratory after receiving my ultimatum, even though [From.GetSheHe] had insisted that it was not ready shortly before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12007;Give me that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12008;[From.GetBestName] quickly fetched the immortality potion from [From.GetHerHis] laboratory after receiving my ultimatum, even though [From.GetSheHe] had insisted that it was not ready shortly before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12008;Give me that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12009;[From.GetBestName] quickly fetched the immortality potion from [From.GetHerHis] laboratory after receiving my ultimatum, even though [From.GetSheHe] had insisted that it was not ready shortly before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12009;Give me that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12011;At long last I have finished the immortality potion that I have been brewing. At least, I think I have. Most attempts by other alchemists in the past have ended in failure, and there is no way I could know for sure prior to drinking it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12011;Time to drink it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12011;I don't think I got it right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12012;At long last I have finished the immortality potion that I have been brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. At least, I think I have. Most attempts by other alchemists in the past have ended in failure, and there is no way I could know for sure prior to someone drinking it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12012;Time to deliver it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12013;[From.GetBestName] has finally delivered the immortality potion I requested from [From.GetHerHim]. There is no way to be certain that [From.GetSheHe] actually has succeeded in brewing a working immortality potion prior to drinking it, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12013;Time to drink it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12013;I don't think it is safe to drink...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12014;[From.GetBestName] has graciously accepted the immortality potion I delivered to [From.GetHerHim]. Now all that remains is for [From.GetHerHim] to drink it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12014;Let's hope it works out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12015;[From.GetBestName] has turned down the immortality potion that I delivered to [From.GetHerHim], stating that [From.GetSheHe] is having second thoughts about it. Evidently, [From.GetSheHe] does not trust that I got it right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12015;I guess I will drink it, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12015;What a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12016;It is time for me to consume the immortality potion. I could drink it all at once, or I could drink a little at a time. The former approach is likely more dangerous, but perhaps the potion might end up being too diluted to work if I drink it more slowly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12016;Immortality can wait no longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12016;I should be careful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12017;It seems [From.GetBestName] has decided to drink the immortality potion a little at a time instead of all at once. This could perhaps end up diluting the effectiveness, but if the potion does not turn out to actually be beneficial [From.GetSheHe] might perhaps avoid any lasting harm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12017;Perhaps a sensible approach...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12019;It worked! I cannot say how I know it, but I know that the immortality potion that I consumed has done its job! Everyone thought it would kill me or drive me mad, but it worked!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12019;Eternal life is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12020;[From.GetBestName] is ecstatic, and seemingly full of life and energy. It seems the immortality potion that I gave [From.GetHerHim] did what it was supposed to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12020;I did it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12021;I do not think that the immortality potion I consumed has given me eternal life, but it certainly seems to have made me quite a bit healthier. At the very least, my life should now be longer than it would have been before I consumed the potion, at least outside of anything violent happening to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12021;I feel amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12021;This is not what I asked for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12022;The immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetBestName] does not seem to have given [From.GetHerHim] eternal life, but [From.GetSheHe] seems quite a bit healthier, and in a very good mood besides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12022;I suppose it worked well enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12023;The immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetBestName] does not seem to have given [From.GetHerHim] eternal life, but [From.GetSheHe] seems quite a bit healthier. Unfortuantely, [From.GetSheHe] also seems rather disappointed with the potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12023;But it helped [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12024;The immortality potion that I consumed seems to have done nothing. I do not feel any healthier, and I do not feel worse. It also has not driven me mad or had any other strange side-effects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12024;It could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12024;This is not what I asked for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12025;It seems the immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetBestName] has not resulted in anything noteworthy. [From.GetSheHeCap] does not seem overly concerned by this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12025;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12026;It seems the immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetBestName] has not resulted in anything noteworthy. [From.GetSheHeCap] does not seem very pleased by this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12026;But it didn't hurt [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12027;The immortality potion that I consumed has not been good for my health. It seems eternal life will not be mine, and perhaps the potion will even end up shortening my lifespan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12027;At least it didn't kill me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12027;This is not what I asked for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12028;The immortality potion that I gave [From.GetBestName] seems to have made [From.GetHerHim] less healthy. [From.GetSheHe] does not seem to be eager to punish me for it, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12028;It could still have gone better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12029;The immortality potion that I gave [From.GetBestName] seems to have made [From.GetHerHim] less healthy. [From.GetSheHe] also seems to be eager to punish me for failing to deliver an actual immortality potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12029;But [From.GetSheHe] survived!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12030;My mind has expanded in so many unexpected ways since I consumed the immortality potion. Eternal life might not be mine, but that would have been a boring outcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12030;This is excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12031;It seems the immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetBestName] has driven [From.GetHerHim] quite mad. [From.GetSheHeCap] does not seem to mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12031;I... see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12032;I am dying! The immortality potion that I consumed seems to have been nothing but a poison by a different name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12032;No! Immortality was to be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12033;It seems the immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetBestName] has killed [From.GetHerHim]. This was not my intention, but I doubt that anyone will believe that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12033;This isn't good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12035;I have been feeling somewhat healthier after drinking some of the immortality potion. If this keeps up, I am sure eternal life will be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12035;I have a good feeling about this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12036;It seems [From.GetBestName] is feeling healthier than before as a result of drinking some more of the immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12036;So far, so good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12037;I have not noticed any difference after drinking some of the immortality potion. Surely I should be feeling better by now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12037;I guess I should continue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12037;I want an explanation for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_12037;I think I should stop...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12038;It seems [From.GetBestName]'s health has not changed noticeably since [From.GetSheHe] last drank some of the immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12038;Hopefully that will change...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12039;[From.GetBestName] has asked me to explain why [From.GetHerHis] health has not changed noticeably despite [From.GetHerHim] recently drinking some of the immortality potion that I provided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12039;Just give it time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12040;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that the immortality potion simply needs more time to do its work, and has suggested that I should keep drinking the remainder at regular intervals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12040;I guess I should continue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12040;I think I should stop...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12041;[From.GetBestName] told me that the immortality potion simply needs more time to do its work and that I should keep drinking it, but I am not sure if I fully believe [From.GetHerHis] words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12041;I'll keep going, I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12041;I think I have had enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12042;It seems [From.GetBestName] has decided to stop drinking the immortality potion that I provided, probably because it seemingly was not doing anything noteworthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12042;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12043;I have started to feel rather less healthy of late, and as best I can tell I started to get worse after I last drank from my immortality potion. This is not as I expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12043;It will pass...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12043;I want an explanation for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_12043;[giving_me_immortality_potion.GetBestName] has poisoned me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_SOH_12043;I won't be having any more of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12044;It seems [From.GetBestName] has been feeling a bit unwell lately, but [From.GetSheHe] does not seem overly concerned even though there possibly is a correlation with when [From.GetSheHe] last drank some of the immortality potion that I provided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12044;I hope [From.GetSheHe] gets better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12045;[From.GetBestName] has expressed quite a bit of concern over the fact that [From.GetSheHe] has been feeling unwell since [From.GetSheHe] last drank some of the immortality potion that I provided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12045;You will get better, I am sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12046;[From.GetBestName] has stopped consuming the immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetHerHim], apparently having found that it made [From.GetHerHim] unwell. Worse, [From.GetSheHe] has gotten it into [From.GetHerHis] mind that I was trying to poison [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12046;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12047;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that the immortality potion is doing its work and that I am feeling unwell because my body is not yet accustomed to the power coursing through me. Consuming more of the potion would help it do its job more quickly, [From.GetSheHe] claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12047;Let's hope it does...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12047;I think I have had enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12048;[From.GetBestName] has told me that the immortality potion is doing its work and that I am feeling unwell because my body is not yet accustomed to the power coursing through me. I am not sure if I believe that, or [From.GetHerHis] claims that more of the potion would help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12048;I'll keep going, I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12048;I think I have had enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_12048;You have poisoned me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12050;[From.GetBestName] has decided that [From.GetSheHe] will not be consuming any more of the immortality potion that I provided, seeing as it has been making [From.GetHerHim] feel a bit unwell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12050;Not entirely surprising...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12051;Not only has [From.GetBestName] decided to stop consuming the immortality potion that I provided due to a spurious connection between it and [From.GetHerHim] feeling a bit under the weather, but [From.GetSheHe] has apparently started to believe that I was intentionally trying to poison [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12051;This isn't good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12052;I can feel a new energy coursing through my head. My mind is expanding, and surely my lifespan is expanding with it. The immortality potion must be doing its job!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12052;More! I should drink more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12053;It seems the immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetBestName] has driven [From.GetHerHim] quite mad. [From.GetSheHeCap] still seems rather pleased, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12053;I... see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12054;Things were going so well just days ago! I stood on the cusp of immortality! I would have an eternity! Now, though... Now, I am dying. The potion was a poison by another name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12054;No! Not now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12055;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] is dead, likely as a consequence of the immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetHerHim]. Everyone will think that I intentionally poisoned [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12055;This isn't good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12056;It is with some apprehension that I consume the final sip of the immortality potion. At first, nothing happens, but then I can feel health and vitality flowing through my veins. I have become immortal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12056;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12057;I have been informed that [From.GetBestName] just consumed the last of the immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetHerHim]. The potion worked, as it turns out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12057;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12058;It is with some apprehension that I consume the final sip of the immortality potion. At first, nothing happens, but soon I notice that I am feeling rather more healthy than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12058;An acceptable outcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12058;I expected better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12059;[From.GetBestName] seems a lot healthier now that [From.GetSheHe] has finished consuming the immortality potion that I provided, though not immortal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12059;It could certainly have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12060;[From.GetBestName] seems a lot healthier now that [From.GetSheHe] has finished consuming the immortality potion that I provided, though not immortal. This still seems to have disappointed [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12060;But it went so well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12061;It is with some apprehension that I consume the final sip of the immortality potion. At first, nothing happens. A bit later, noting happens. Then nothing keeps on happening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12061;I suppose that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12061;I expected better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12062;[From.GetBestName]'s health seems neither better nor worse now that [From.GetSheHe] has finished consuming the immortality potion that I provided. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems reasonably content with this outcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12062;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12063;[From.GetBestName]'s health seems neither better nor worse now that [From.GetSheHe] has finished consuming the immortality potion that I provided. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems very displeased with this outcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12063;But it didn't do any harm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12064;It is with some apprehension that I consume the final sip of the immortality potion. At first, nothing happens, but soon I notice that I am feeling quite unwell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12064;That was a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12064;I expected better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12065;I had hoped that [From.GetBestName] would be feeling very healthy when [From.GetSheHe] finished consuming the immortality potion that I provided, but instead [From.GetSheHe] seems to be doing a lot worse. At least [From.GetSheHe] does not seem to be blaming me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12065;That did not go as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12066;I had hoped that [From.GetBestName] would be feeling very healthy when [From.GetSheHe] finished consuming the immortality potion that I provided, but instead [From.GetSheHe] seems to be doing a lot worse. Additional [From.GetSheHe] seems to be blaming me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12066;This might be bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12067;It is with some apprehension that I consume the final sip of the immortality potion. At first, nothing happens, but then I can feel my mind expanding! I see clearly now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12067;Yes! Yes! This is excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12068;It is clear that the immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetBestName] has driven [From.GetHerHim] quite mad. Despite this being very different from the expected outcome, [From.GetSheHe] seems quite pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12068;I... see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12069;It is with some apprehension that I consume the final sip of the immortality potion. At first, nothing happens, but then I can feel my energy draining away. I fall to the ground, and my vision starts to fade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12069;So it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12070;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] collapsed after consuming the last of the immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetHerHim], and that despite seeming quite well prior to [From.GetHerHis] collapse [From.GetSheHe] was dead by the time anyone reached [From.GetHerHim]. I think I will be blamed for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12070;This isn't good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12072;[From.GetBestName] died before [From.GetSheHe] could finish the last of the immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12072;Well, that's not on me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12073;At long last I have finished the supposed immortality potion that I have been brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName]. It will certainly not grant immortality, but it will hopefully also not do [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] any lasting harm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12073;Time to deliver it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12074;[From.GetBestName] has finally delivered the immortality potion I requested from [From.GetHerHim]. There is no way to be certain that [From.GetSheHe] actually has succeeded in brewing a working immortality potion prior to drinking it, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12074;Time to drink it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12074;I don't think it is safe to drink...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12075;[From.GetBestName] has graciously accepted the supposed immortality potion I delivered to [From.GetHerHim]. Now all that remains is for [From.GetHerHim] to drink it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12075;Let's hope it works out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12076;[From.GetBestName] has turned down the supposed immortality potion that I delivered to [From.GetHerHim], stating that [From.GetSheHe] is having second thoughts about it. Evidently, [From.GetSheHe] does not trust that I got it right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12076;Perhaps for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12077;It is time for me to consume the immortality potion. I could drink it all at once, or I could drink a little at a time. The former approach is likely more dangerous, but perhaps the potion might end up being too diluted to work if I drink it more slowly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12077;Immortality can wait no longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12077;I should be careful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12078;It seems [From.GetBestName] has decided to drink the supposed immortality potion a little at a time instead of all at once. This could perhaps end up diluting the effectiveness, but if the potion does not turn out to actually be beneficial [From.GetSheHe] might perhaps avoid any lasting harm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12078;Perhaps a sensible approach...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12080;I do not think that the immortality potion I consumed has given me eternal life, but it certainly seems to have made me quite a bit healthier. At the very least, my life should now be longer than it would have been before I consumed the potion, at least outside of anything violent happening to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12080;I feel amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12080;This is not what I asked for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12081;The supposed immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetBestName] does not seem to have given [From.GetHerHim] eternal life, but [From.GetSheHe] seems quite a bit healthier, and in a very good mood besides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12081;I suppose it worked well enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12082;The supposed immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetBestName] does not seem to have given [From.GetHerHim] eternal life, but [From.GetSheHe] seems quite a bit healthier. Unfortuantely, [From.GetSheHe] also seems rather disappointed with the potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12082;But it helped [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12083;The immortality potion that I consumed seems to have done nothing. I do not feel any healthier, and I do not feel worse. It also has not driven me mad or had any other strange side-effects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12083;It could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12083;This is not what I asked for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12084;It seems the supposed immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetBestName] has not resulted in anything noteworthy. [From.GetSheHeCap] does not seem overly concerned by this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12084;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12085;It seems the supposed immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetBestName] has not resulted in anything noteworthy. [From.GetSheHeCap] does not seem very pleased by this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12085;But it didn't hurt [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12086;The immortality potion that I consumed has not been good for my health. It seems eternal life will not be mine, and perhaps the potion will even end up shortening my lifespan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12086;At least it didn't kill me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12086;This is not what I asked for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12087;The supposed immortality potion that I gave [From.GetBestName] seems to have made [From.GetHerHim] less healthy. [From.GetSheHe] does not seem to be eager to punish me for it, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12087;It could still have gone better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12088;The supposed immortality potion that I gave [From.GetBestName] seems to have made [From.GetHerHim] less healthy. [From.GetSheHe] also seems to be eager to punish me for failing to deliver an actual immortality potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12088;But [From.GetSheHe] survived!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12089;My mind has expanded in so many unexpected ways since I consumed the immortality potion. Eternal life might not be mine, but that would have been a boring outcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12089;This is excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12090;It seems the supposed immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetBestName] has driven [From.GetHerHim] quite mad. [From.GetSheHeCap] does not seem to mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12090;I... see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12091;I am dying! The immortality potion that I consumed seems to have been nothing but a poison by a different name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12091;No! Immortality was to be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12092;It seems the supposed immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetBestName] has killed [From.GetHerHim]. This was not my intention, but I doubt that anyone will believe that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12092;This isn't good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12094;I have been feeling somewhat healthier after drinking some of the immortality potion. If this keeps up, I am sure eternal life will be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12094;I have a good feeling about this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12095;It seems [From.GetBestName] is feeling healthier than before as a result of drinking some more of the supposed immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12095;So far, so good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12096;I have not noticed any difference after drinking some of the immortality potion. Surely I should be feeling better by now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12096;I guess I should continue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12096;I want an explanation for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_12096;I think I should stop...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12097;It seems [From.GetBestName]'s health has not changed noticeably since [From.GetSheHe] last drank some of the supposed immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12097;Hopefully that will change...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12098;[From.GetBestName] has asked me to explain why [From.GetHerHis] health has not changed noticeably despite [From.GetHerHim] recently drinking some of the supposed immortality potion that I provided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12098;Just give it time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12099;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that the immortality potion simply needs more time to do its work, and has suggested that I should keep drinking the remainder at regular intervals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12099;I guess I should continue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12099;I think I should stop...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12100;[From.GetBestName] told me that the immortality potion simply needs more time to do its work and that I should keep drinking it, but I am not sure if I fully believe [From.GetHerHis] words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12100;I'll keep going, I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12100;I think I have had enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12101;It seems [From.GetBestName] has decided to stop drinking the supposed immortality potion that I provided, probably because it seemingly was not doing anything noteworthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12101;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12102;I have started to feel rather less healthy of late, and as best I can tell I started to get worse after I last drank from my immortality potion. This is not as I expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12102;It will pass...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12102;I want an explanation for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_12102;[giving_me_immortality_potion.GetBestName] has poisoned me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_SOH_12102;I won't be having any more of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12103;It seems [From.GetBestName] has been feeling a bit unwell lately, but [From.GetSheHe] does not seem overly concerned even though there possibly is a correlation with when [From.GetSheHe] last drank some of the supposed immortality potion that I provided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12103;I hope [From.GetSheHe] gets better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12104;[From.GetBestName] has expressed quite a bit of concern over the fact that [From.GetSheHe] has been feeling unwell since [From.GetSheHe] last drank some of the supposed immortality potion that I provided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12104;You will get better, I am sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12105;[From.GetBestName] has stopped consuming the supposed immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetHerHim], apparently having found that it made [From.GetHerHim] unwell. Worse, [From.GetSheHe] has gotten it into [From.GetHerHis] mind that I was trying to poison [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12105;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12106;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that the immortality potion is doing its work and that I am feeling unwell because my body is not yet accustomed to the power coursing through me. Consuming more of the potion would help it do its job more quickly, [From.GetSheHe] claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12106;Let's hope it does...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12106;I think I have had enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12107;[From.GetBestName] has told me that the immortality potion is doing its work and that I am feeling unwell because my body is not yet accustomed to the power coursing through me. I am not sure if I believe that, or [From.GetHerHis] claims that more of the potion would help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12107;I'll keep going, I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12107;I think I have had enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_12107;You have poisoned me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_12129;[From.GetBestName] died before [From.GetSheHe] could finish the last of the immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12129;Well, that's not on me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12130;At long last I have finished the poison that I have been brewing for [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName] instead of the immortality potion [getting_immortality_potion.GetSheHe] expects. I do not know for sure that it will kill [getting_immortality_potion.GetBestName], of course, but it certainly will not grant [getting_immortality_potion.GetHerHim] eternal life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SOH_12134;I should be careful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12135;It seems [From.GetBestName] has decided to drink the supposed immortality potion a little at a time instead of all at once. This could perhaps end up diluting the effectiveness of the poison, and thus potentially mean it will not cause any lasting harm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12135;That's less than ideal for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12137;I do not think that the immortality potion I consumed has given me eternal life, but it certainly seems to have made me quite a bit healthier. At the very least, my life should now be longer than it would have been before I consumed the potion, at least outside of anything violent happening to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12137;I feel amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12137;This is not what I asked for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12138;The supposed immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetBestName] does not seem to have given [From.GetHerHim] eternal life, but [From.GetSheHe] seems quite a bit healthier, and in a very good mood besides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12138;Not at all what I wanted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12139;The supposed immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetBestName] does not seem to have given [From.GetHerHim] eternal life, but [From.GetSheHe] seems quite a bit healthier. [From.GetSheHeCap] also seems rather disappointed with the potion, as [From.GetSheHe] has not gained eternal life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12139;We are both disappointed, if for different reasons...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12140;The immortality potion that I consumed seems to have done nothing. I do not feel any healthier, and I do not feel worse. It also has not driven me mad or had any other strange side-effects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12140;It could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12140;This is not what I asked for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12141;It seems the supposed immortality potion - actually a poison - that I provided for [From.GetBestName] has not resulted in anything noteworthy. [From.GetSheHeCap] does not seem overly concerned by this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12141;I had hoped for something different...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12142;It seems the supposed immortality potion - actually a poison - that I provided for [From.GetBestName] has not resulted in anything noteworthy. [From.GetSheHeCap] does not seem very pleased by this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12142;Neither am I...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12143;The immortality potion that I consumed has not been good for my health. It seems eternal life will not be mine, and perhaps the potion will even end up shortening my lifespan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12143;At least it didn't kill me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12143;This is not what I asked for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12144;The poison that I gave [From.GetBestName] under the guise of giving [From.GetHerHim] an immortality potion seems to have made [From.GetHerHim] less healthy. [From.GetSheHe] does not seem to be eager to punish me for it, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12144;I suppose it could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12145;The poison that I gave [From.GetBestName] under the guise of giving [From.GetHerHim] an immortality potion seems to have made [From.GetHerHim] less healthy. [From.GetSheHe] also seems to be eager to punish me for failing to deliver an actual immortality potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12145;It could have gone quite a bit better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12146;My mind has expanded in so many unexpected ways since I consumed the immortality potion. Eternal life might not be mine, but that would have been a boring outcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12146;This is excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12147;It seems the poison that I gave [From.GetBestName] in place of an immortality potion has driven [From.GetHerHim] quite mad. [From.GetSheHeCap] does not seem to mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12147;I... see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12148;I am dying! The immortality potion that I consumed seems to have been nothing but a poison by a different name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12148;No! Immortality was to be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12149;It seems the poison that I provided for [From.GetBestName] as a supposed immortality potion has killed [From.GetHerHim]. Just as planned, though unfortunately I will likely be blamed for [From.GetHerHis] death...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12149;At least [From.GetSheHe] is dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12151;I have been feeling somewhat healthier after drinking some of the immortality potion. If this keeps up, I am sure eternal life will be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12151;I have a good feeling about this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12152;It seems [From.GetBestName] is feeling healthier than before as a result of drinking some more of what I expected to be a poison when I gave it to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12152;So far, so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12153;I have not noticed any difference after drinking some of the immortality potion. Surely I should be feeling better by now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12153;I guess I should continue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12153;I want an explanation for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_12153;I think I should stop...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12154;It seems [From.GetBestName]'s health has not changed noticeably since [From.GetSheHe] last drank some of the supposed immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12154;Hopefully that will change... for the worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12155;[From.GetBestName] has asked me to explain why [From.GetHerHis] health has not changed noticeably despite [From.GetHerHim] recently drinking some of the poison I provided under the guise of an immortality potion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12155;Uh... it might need more time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12156;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that the immortality potion simply needs more time to do its work, and has suggested that I should keep drinking the remainder at regular intervals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12156;I guess I should continue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12156;I think I should stop...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12157;[From.GetBestName] told me that the immortality potion simply needs more time to do its work and that I should keep drinking it, but I am not sure if I fully believe [From.GetHerHis] words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12157;I'll keep going, I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12157;I think I have had enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12158;It seems [From.GetBestName] has decided to stop drinking the supposed immortality potion that I provided, probably because it seemingly was not doing anything noteworthy. As I was hoping to poison [From.GetHerHim], this is not ideal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12158;So much time wasted...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12159;I have started to feel rather less healthy of late, and as best I can tell I started to get worse after I last drank from my immortality potion. This is not as I expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12159;It will pass...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12159;I want an explanation for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_12159;[giving_me_immortality_potion.GetBestName] has poisoned me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTD_SOH_12159;I won't be having any more of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12160;It seems [From.GetBestName] has been feeling a bit unwell lately, but [From.GetSheHe] does not seem overly concerned even though there possibly is a correlation with when [From.GetSheHe] last drank some of the poison that I provided under the guise of an immortality potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12160;I hope [From.GetSheHe] gets worse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12161;[From.GetBestName] has expressed quite a bit of concern over the fact that [From.GetSheHe] has been feeling unwell since [From.GetSheHe] last drank some of the supposed immortality potion that I provided. As I was hoping for a deadly poison, things could certainly have gone better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12161;I believe things will improve if you drink some more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12162;[From.GetBestName] has stopped consuming the supposed immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetHerHim], apparently having found that it made [From.GetHerHim] unwell. Worse, [From.GetSheHe] has started to suspect that I was actually trying to poison [From.GetHerHim], which of course is true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12162;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12163;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that the immortality potion is doing its work and that I am feeling unwell because my body is not yet accustomed to the power coursing through me. Consuming more of the potion would help it do its job more quickly, [From.GetSheHe] claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12163;Let's hope it does...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12163;I think I have had enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12164;[From.GetBestName] has told me that the immortality potion is doing its work and that I am feeling unwell because my body is not yet accustomed to the power coursing through me. I am not sure if I believe that, or [From.GetHerHis] claims that more of the potion would help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12164;I'll keep going, I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12164;I think I have had enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_12164;You have poisoned me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12165;[From.GetBestName] has decided that [From.GetSheHe] will not be consuming any more of the supposed immortality potion that I provided, seeing as it has been making [From.GetHerHim] feel a bit unwell. As I was hoping the poison would kill [From.GetHerHim], this is an unwelcome development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12165;Most unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12166;Not only has [From.GetBestName] decided to stop consuming the supposed immortality potion that I provided after feeling a bit under the weather, but [From.GetSheHe] has apparently started to believe that I was intentionally trying to poison [From.GetHerHim]. While true, I would have hoped to avoid discovery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12166;This isn't good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12167;I can feel a new energy coursing through my head. My mind is expanding, and surely my lifespan is expanding with it. The immortality potion must be doing its job!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12167;More! I should drink more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12168;It seems the supposed immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetBestName] has driven [From.GetHerHim] quite mad, as opposed to killing [From.GetHerHim] as I intended. [From.GetSheHeCap] still seems rather pleased, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12168;I... see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12169;Things were going so well just days ago! I stood on the cusp of immortality! I would have an eternity! Now, though... Now, I am dying. The potion was a poison by another name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12169;No! Not now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12170;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] is dead, likely as a consequence of the poison that I gave [From.GetHerHim] under the guise of an immortality potion. Everyone will think that I intentionally poisoned [From.GetHerHim]. This is of course true, but avoiding discovery would have been more to my liking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12170;At least [From.GetSheHe] is finally dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12171;It is with some apprehension that I consume the final sip of the immortality potion. At first, nothing happens, but soon I notice that I am feeling rather more healthy than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12171;An acceptable outcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12171;I expected better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12172;[From.GetBestName] seems a lot healthier now that [From.GetSheHe] has finished consuming the supposed immortality potion that I provided, though not immortal. As it was meant to be a deadly poison, this outcome is not to my liking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12172;Why did I not brew something more harmful?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12173;[From.GetBestName] seems a lot healthier now that [From.GetSheHe] has finished consuming the supposed immortality potion that I provided, though not immortal. This still seems to have disappointed [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12173;And I was hoping to kill [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12174;It is with some apprehension that I consume the final sip of the immortality potion. At first, nothing happens. A bit later, noting happens. Then nothing keeps on happening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12174;I suppose that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12174;I expected better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12175;[From.GetBestName]'s health seems neither better nor worse now that [From.GetSheHe] has finished consuming the supposed immortality potion that I provided. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems reasonably content with this outcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12175;And I was hoping to harm [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12176;[From.GetBestName]'s health seems neither better nor worse now that [From.GetSheHe] has finished consuming the supposed immortality potion that I provided. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems very displeased with this outcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12176;As am I, if for a different reason...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12177;It is with some apprehension that I consume the final sip of the immortality potion. At first, nothing happens, but soon I notice that I am feeling quite unwell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12177;That was a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12177;I expected better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12178;I had hoped that [From.GetBestName] would be feeling very healthy when [From.GetSheHe] finished consuming the supposed immortality potion that I provided, but instead [From.GetSheHe] seems to be doing a lot worse. At least [From.GetSheHe] does not seem to be blaming me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12178;Unfortunately, [From.GetSheHe] yet lives...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12179;I had hoped that [From.GetBestName] would be feeling very healthy when [From.GetSheHe] finished consuming the supposed immortality potion that I provided, but instead [From.GetSheHe] seems to be doing a lot worse. Additional [From.GetSheHe] seems to be blaming me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12179;And yet I failed to kill [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12180;It is with some apprehension that I consume the final sip of the immortality potion. At first, nothing happens, but then I can feel my mind expanding! I see clearly now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12180;Yes! Yes! This is excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12181;It is clear that the supposed immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetBestName] has driven [From.GetHerHim] quite mad, as opposed to killing [From.GetHerHim] as I would have preferred. Despite this being very different from the outcome [From.GetBestName] would have expected, [From.GetSheHe] seems quite pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12181;I... see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12182;It is with some apprehension that I consume the final sip of the immortality potion. At first, nothing happens, but then I can feel my energy draining away. I fall to the ground, and my vision starts to fade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12182;So it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12183;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] collapsed after consuming the last of the poison that I provided for [From.GetHerHim] under the guise of giving [From.GetHerHim] an immortality potion, and that despite seeming quite well prior to [From.GetHerHis] collapse [From.GetSheHe] was dead by the time anyone reached [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12183;Unfortunately, people will know to blame me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12185;[From.GetBestName] died before [From.GetSheHe] could finish the last of the immortality potion that I provided for [From.GetHerHim]. As it was supposed to be a deadly poison, this is hardly unwelcome news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12185;At worst, I don't know if the poison was any good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12187;[From.GetBestName] has died, and as such [From.GetSheHe] will not be able to finish the immortality potion [From.GetSheHe] was brewing for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12187;I guess I will have to find someone else...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12188;It seems [From.GetBestName]'s days as a member of the Righteous Apothecary Society are behind [From.GetHerHim] and that [From.GetSheHe] consequence will not be finishing the immortality potion [From.GetSheHe] was brewing for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12188;I guess I will have to find someone else...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12189;Eternal life is mine, and as such I have no need for the immortality potion that I have been brewing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12189;I can spend my time doing something else now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12190;[From.GetBestName] has become immortal, and as such [From.GetSheHe] has no need for the immortality potion that I have been brewing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12190;I might as well brew it for myself, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12190;What a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_12192;[From.GetBestName] has died, and is therefore not in any position to consume the immortality potion that I have been brewing for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_12192;I will brew it for myself, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_12192;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
