EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1104;That maniac must be brought to justice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1105;It has come to my attention that [From.GetBestName] now claims to be the rightful master of the Dragon Throne.

EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1105;An obvious forgery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCA_TIANXIA_1107;You are discussing a routine matter regarding the training of your guards when Wandy the Talking Wand comes flying from wherever it previously was located, being chased by an irate servant.\n"It seems you are trying to handle a matter concerning warfare," it says as it comes to a halt near you.

EVTDESCB_TIANXIA_1107;"Hello!" You look around and spot Wandy the Talking Wand, which apparently has seen fit to approach you as you are thinking about matters of state. "It looks like you are contemplating something related to rulership. Can I help you with that?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1108;Was that supposed to be helpful?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1108;Of course! Of course! I see it now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1110;Of late, I have been hearing indistinct whispers. They seem to be particularly frequent when I am in the presence of Sanity's Demise. Of course, the dagger tends to speak up whenever it wants to make itself heard, so maybe I am just imagining things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1110;I must be imagining things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1110;Could you speak up?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_TIANXIA_1111;"Beyond this world, there is the Shroud," the voice of Sanity's Demise suddenly whispers in your mind. "Breach it. Breach the Shroud! There, you will find the Five. Make a compact, if you wish, and reap the rewards. Sooner or later, the End of the Cycle must be brought forth!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_TIANXIA_1111;"I had a... sister, once, you know," the dagger you know as Sanity's Demise whispers one day. "She found her way into the hands of a priest fighting a legion, who sadly abused her power and discarded her afterwards. You must never make the same mistake!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_TIANXIA_1111;"Do you know what they are saying behind your back?" Sanity's Demise whispers to you with no warning. "Can you trust your friends? Can you know your enemies? I can show you the truth, as long as you know to trust me and me alone!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_TIANXIA_1111;"I will always be here to help you," you hear the voice of Sanity's Demise say in your mind. "I am, after all, your one true friend.

EVTDESCE_TIANXIA_1111;"Humans such as you could be so much more," the dagger you know as Sanity's Demise says in a whisper. "Sadly, your minds are shackled by the fetters you call 'sanity'. Free your mind! Let me expand it! I will show you things you have never dreamt of!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCF_TIANXIA_1111;"It is curious, don't you think, that the color yellow is associated with the Dragon Throne," the whispering voice of Sanity's Demise unexpectedly says in your mind. "It has of course always been the color of rulership, but there was a time when it was associated with... a King!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCG_TIANXIA_1111;"In the far north, there is a place of power just outside your reach," Sanity's Demise whispers into your mind one day when you are perusing some maps. "Go there. Bore a hole. The Wheel can be broken, and the Great Serpent can be slain!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCH_TIANXIA_1111;"Three they are, and three shall they always be," Sanity's Demise whispers. "They hunger, always, for more souls to feed on. Those that stray near their domain may bring them forth. First shall come the Unbidden! The Aberrant shall follow after! And then, the Vehement will arrive!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCI_TIANXIA_1111;"Names have power, and I know many names," the dagger called Sanity's Demise whispers to you. "I could tell you some of them, and you could speak them. Once or twice would of course not suffice, but three times should be enough for... a revelation!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCJ_TIANXIA_1111;"Have you ever heard the tragedy of Pius the August?" you hear Sanity's Demise asking in your mind. "It is not a tale a historian would tell you." The dagger laughs in your mind. "He seeks to bring his master into this world, but he is doomed to fail. Alexandra the Saviour will see to it!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCK_TIANXIA_1111;"Such fascinating secrets those around you have," Sanity's Demise tells you. "The Unfaithful. The Apostate. The Kinslayer. The Traitor. Oh, I am sure you might know who some of them are, but how certain are you? I could tell you a few things, I think...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCL_TIANXIA_1111;"Just as planned!" Sanity's Demise suddenly proclaims in your mind. "It is all as it should be. The pieces on the chessboard are moving as the players desire while thinking that they have a will of their own. They will all learn the truth, one day, when it no longer matters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCM_TIANXIA_1111;"Build a temple," the dagger known as Sanity's demise suddenly says, speaking directly into your mind. "Build a temple, and put a bell in it, adorned with great horns. Ring it thirteen times, and the truth as to what lies beneath your cities shall be revealed!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCN_TIANXIA_1111;"Good and Evil," you hear the voice of Sanity's Demise suddenly whisper in your mind. "Order and Chaos. Blue and Orange." The voice laughs for quite a while before continuing. "Your human notions when it comes to morality are so... quaint.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCO_TIANXIA_1111;"If you knew more than the merest fraction of what I know, you would go mad," Sanity's Demise proclaims in your mind in the middle of the night, causing you to come awake. "Of course, I'm sure you can stand to know a little more than you currently do, don't you think?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCP_TIANXIA_1111;"Listen to the voices from beyond the stars," the wicked dagger known as Sanity's Demise whispers to you. "They know the truth. They know all the truths." The dagger lets out a wicked laugh. "You will see, one day soon, when everything is revealed!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCQ_TIANXIA_1111;"Have you heard of the Outer Gates?" Sanity's Demise suddenly asks in your mind, continuing before you have the chance to attempt to respond to the question. "There are those that would seek to prevent you from questing beyond them, but they lack the vision to see the truth!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCR_TIANXIA_1111;"Shall I tell you what the future holds?" the voice of Sanity's Demise whispers to you. "It will be grim and dark, you see. The stars shall know no peace, and the laughter of gods shall echo among them. An eternity of slaughter awaits you, as there shall be only war!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCS_TIANXIA_1111;"That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons even death may die," Sanity's Demise tells you, speaking into your mind. "There are things in this world you cannot possibly know, not if you wish to keep your mind whole. Of course, that would hold you back...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCT_TIANXIA_1111;"Six are the stones, but only two are nearby," Sanity's Demise tells you one day after you have visited a small shrine. "Space is in the church. Time is in the Sanctum. Find them, and use them to find the Soul, the Mind, Reality, and Power. Once that is done, snap your fingers and all shall be as you desire!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCU_TIANXIA_1111;"The Black Pharaoh's reign ended long ago, but he seeks his throne once more," Sanity's Demise's voice whispers. "Should he regain it, all of your petty little squabbles will be as nothing. You might try to oppose him, of course, but to do so you would need my help!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCV_TIANXIA_1111;"There are powers that would see fit to ask for the blood of a virgin, or a child, or a holy person," Sanity's Demise whispers into your mind. "In truth, any human's blood would suffice. I can show you, if you will only let me! I'm sure you won't regret it...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCW_TIANXIA_1111;"What was will be," you hear Sanity's Demise whispering. "What will be was. So it has been, always, and so it must always be. The Worm loves you. It always has. It always will. Of course, I love you more than it has, does, or will, and thus you should not be tempted by its power!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCX_TIANXIA_1111;"With the defeat of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, you must think that this world is capable of defeating any dragon," Sanity's Demise tells you, one day. "I wonder what you will think when you discover the one from the Void. One of you might stand a chance, but would you truly side with Him...?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCY_TIANXIA_1111;"Beneath the surface of this world you can find many truths," Sanity's Demise tells you. "There are cities there, you know, that belong to those that once ruled this world. Their empires have crubled, but they remain. You should dig for answers!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCZ_TIANXIA_1111;"Don't think that the fourth wall will protect you, little human!" Sanity's Demise suddenly whispers. "I can see you! I have always been able to see you! But don't be afraid! I am here to help! Let me show you the truth about your world!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1111;What nonsense is this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1111;Could you repeat that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1112;"They laugh behind your back," Sanity's Demise whispers in my ear. "They plot, and scheme, and seek to bring an end to all that you hold dear. Trust in me, and know that you are among enemies.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1112;Could that be true...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1112;Yes! I see clearly now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1113;"That there are those who have what should be yours cannot be denied, can it?" Sanity's Demise asks me one day. "Seize it! The wants and needs of others do not need to concern you!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1113;Could that be true...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1113;Yes! I see clearly now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1114;"More!" Sanity's Demise whispers. "You should strive for more! More land! More power! More renown! More sacrifices, too..." The dagger laughs in my mind. "Especially the sacrifices, I think.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1114;Could that be true...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1114;Yes! I see clearly now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1115;"Some lessons are harsh," the dagger known as Sanity's Demise tells me one day. "Do not be afraid to teach others that. Pain is temporary. Power is eternal!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1115;Could that be true...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1115;Yes! I see clearly now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1116;"I always tell you the truth, you know," Sanity's Demise whispers to me. "The truth is, truth can be overrated, and dangerous. Your enemies might use the truth against you. Next to me, your primary weapon should be lies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1116;Could that be true...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1121;"You are a mighty [Root.GetTitle]," Sanity's Demise whispers to me. "Powerful. Knowledgeable. Envied by all. Even so, you could be more powerful." The dagger twitches in my hand, moving to point towards [sacrifice.GetBestName]. "What is one life, in the grand scheme of things?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1121;No! This is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1122;Hearing movement behind me, I turn around to see [From.GetBestName] was standing much too close for comfort, holding the wicked dagger [From.GetSheHe] calls Sanity's Demise in [From.GetHerHis] hand.\n"Power demands sacrifice," [From.GetSheHe] says, thrusting the dagger into my chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1122;This isn't you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1123;There are those that would say that the dagger known as Sanity's Demise has had a detrimental effect on my mind, but I know the truth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCA_TIANXIA_1125;You are inspecting a recently constructed building in [Root.Capital.GetName] when you hear the Living Flame speak to you, even though you have not seen fit to bring it with you.\n"IT IS SO FLAMMABLE," it tells you. "BURN IT! BURN IT TO THE GROUND!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_TIANXIA_1125;You are having trouble sleeping one night and decide to go for a walk in [Root.Capital.GetName]. A short while after you set off the voice of the Living Flame speaks in your mind.\n"THIS NIGHT IS DARK, BUT IT COULD BE SO MUCH BRIGHTER!" it says. "START A BONFIRE!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_TIANXIA_1125;The Living Flame suddenly speaks in your mind one day when you are taking a break from the affairs of the day.\n"THIS WORLD, AND EVERYTHING YOU SEE, CAN BURN!" it tells you. "YOU KNOW I SPEAK THE TRUTH, HUMAN, AND YOU KNOW OF SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD BURN!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_TIANXIA_1125;"THIS DAY IS BRIGHT, BUT IT COULD BE EVEN BRIGHTER!" the voice of the Living Flame suddenly says in your mind, catching you by surprise. "GO OUTSIDE! FIND SOMETHING TO BURN! SHOW THE WORLD A SMALL TASTE OF MY POWER!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_TIANXIA_1125;There are some buildings in [Root.Capital.GetName] that are beautiful to look at, but others are not particularly nice to behold.

EVTDESCF_TIANXIA_1125;"FIRE!" the voice of the Living Flame says in your mind. "A GREAT FIRE IS WHAT THIS PLACE NEEDS!"

"EVERYTHING IS BETTER WITH MORE FIRE!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCG_TIANXIA_1125;"FIRE CLEANSES!" you hear the Living Flame say in your mind one day when you are taking a short walk. "FIRE ILLUMINATES!" You continue walking, certain that it will speak to you again. "THIS PLACE NEEDS TO BURN! YOU KNOW I SPEAK THE TRUTH!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1125;I think that's a terrible idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1125;Yes! YES! IT MUST BURN!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_TIANXIA_1126;You are inspecting your armory and currently hold the Hungering Blade in your hand as one of your guards arrives to quickly go over some details regarding the treatment of [hungering_blade_target.GetBestName], one of your prisoners.\nSuddenly the sword you are holding seems to come awake. "That one!" it says. "FEED ME that one!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_TIANXIA_1126;You are polishing the Hungering Blade one day and find your mind wandering as you do so. After a while you start thinking about your prisoners, particularly [hungering_blade_target.GetBestName].\n"I HUNGER!" the blade suddenly says. "I need to FEED! Give me that prisoner!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_TIANXIA_1126;"I need BLOOD!" the Hungering Blade proclaims one day when you are inspecting it. "I must FEED!"\nYou start to consider how you could feed the sword you are holding and eventually find yourself thinking about your prisoners, specifically [hungering_blade_target.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_TIANXIA_1126;One day when you are practicing your skills by swinging the Hungering Blade at some practice targets you feel the sword come awake in your hands.\n"Give me a SOUL!" it says. "Give me [hungering_blade_target.GetBestName]'s SOUL!" It starts twisting about in your hand. "You need to FEED me!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1126;Even [hungering_blade_target.GetSheHe] doesn't deserve that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_1126;I think it is time for you to feast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_1127;You are surprised to see [From.GetBestName] approach you, carrying a wicked-looking black blade. [From.GetSheHe] is gently stroking the sword as [From.GetSheHe] moves closer, which is rather unusual.\n"Time to feed, my friend!" [From.GetBestName] suddenly exclaims, surging towards you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TIANXIA_1127;No! Get that thing away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
