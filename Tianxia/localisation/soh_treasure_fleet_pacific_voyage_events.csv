EVTTITLE_SOH_9303;Pillars Touching the Clouds;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9303;Last night, the Treasure Fleet sailed into a thick mist, despite the misgivings of some of the sailors aboard. We have managed to continue east even so, and shortly after dawn the mists started to dissipate, revealing an unexpected sight in front of us.\n\nWe are approaching an island, still some distance away. It is hard to make out any details as of yet, save for there being a majestic mountain at the heart of the island, surrounded by tall pillar-like rock formations that seem to be teeming with vegetation of some kind. Something atop the mountain appears to be gleaming, as if made from metal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9303;Could it be...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9303;This feels familiar...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9303;What is this place...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9304;The Ancient Shipwrecks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9304;As the Treasure Fleet approaches the shore of the mysterious island some of the sailors notice something unexpected and call out. A large number of shipwrecks lie just off the shore, each ship at least as large as those of the Treasure Fleet, all of them looking impossibly ancient.\n\nAs we draw closer, some sharp-eyed scholars aboard manage to decipher the two characters written on the sails of the fleet in ancient seal script and loudly announce what they read: "Qin" and "Han".\n\nIt would seem the decaying ships originated from the Middle Kingdom, though not recently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9304;We must investigate this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9304;This is a bad sign!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9306;The Stairway to the Heavens;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9306;The party that headed ashore has now reached the base of the mountain at the center of the island, with the journey so far being most uneventful. So far, no signs of civilization have been encountered since coming ashore, whether along the path the main party has taken or the trails the scouts have followed.\n\nExploring the base of the mountain, it is discovered that its slopes are far too steep to attempt to climb, but that that will not be necessary. Strangely enough, a stone staircase wide enough that a hundred [Root.GetMenWomen] could climb it as one, has been located, leading up the mountain towards the metallic gleam above.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9306;We continue on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9306;I will turn back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9307;Palaces of Gold and Silver;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9307;The party from the Treasure Fleet has now made its way more than halfway to the summit of the mountain, as best as anyone has been able to determine. The broad staircase at the bottom of the mountain ended at the start of a winding path along the side of the mountain, which led to another equally broad staircase, then another winding path, and so on.\n\nAs we reach the base of the next staircase, we finally get a good look at what is located at the snow-capped summit, finding it to be a large number of palaces of gold and silver, surrounded by what appears to be a walled garden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9307;A wondrous sight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9308;The Jade-Armored Maidens;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9308;The final staircase leads to a broad path that continues on towards a set of gates that seem to lead towards a lush garden, judging by the treets that can be glimpsed over the top of the wall. The party continues towards them, between ranks of ornately carved statues of green jade.\n\n"Halt!" a voice suddenly calls out as the statues flanking the path suddenly start to move. Looking at them more closely, I can see that what I thought was a bunch of statues instead are beautiful women armored and armed with jade.\n\n"Who approaches the summit of Mount Penglai?" the speaker demands, stepping up in front of the gates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9308;A humble visitor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9308;Someone that deserves to enter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9308;A weary traveller!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_9308;Someone seeking immortality!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9309;The speaker, who seems to be the leader of the strangely adorned women, considers my words for a moment and then nods, almost imperceptibly.\n\n"You may pass.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9309;You have my thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9310;The speaker, who seems to be the leader of the strangely adorned women, considers my words for a moment and then shakes her head, almost imperceptibly.\n\n"You may not pass.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9310;I don't think I should insist...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9312;Peach Trees and Lotus Flowers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9312;Those who are permitted to pass the gates to the gardens are led inside, escorted by the women in jade, who also make certain that everyone that has been turned back does not think to follow.\n\nInside the walls, we come upon a truly massive garden, growing as if in the heart of summer despite the snow found just outside the walls. A multitude of colorful flowers can be seen throughout the garden, including what looks like lotuses aside from their strange colors, and a great many peach trees grow between the many ponds and streams. We can also see a number of young men, dressed in robes fit for officials in an era long gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9312;Such a fascinating place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9313;The Great Table;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9313;On the other side of the garden we discover an impossibly large table upon which a truly spectacular feast has been readied. As we approach, a man in a very elaborate robe suddenly appears in front of us, as if out of nowhere.\n\n"Welcome!" the man proclaims, inclining his head slightly. "I am Anqi Sheng. The true masters of Mount Penglai are absent at this time, I am afraid, but I am sure they would not wish for me to send you on your way without first offering you a feast on their behalf.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9313;A feast? Certainly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9315;The feast is quite filling, and the jade-armored maidens and the robed men prove to be good company, as does our strange host. I find myself feeling as if my life once more has purpose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9315;I needed this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9316;The feast is quite filling, and the jade-armored maidens and the robed men prove to be good company, as does our strange host. As the evening progresses, I find myself able to relax for the first time in a long while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9316;I feel like a new person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9317;The feast is quite filling, and the jade-armored maidens and the robed men prove to be good company, as does our strange host. They are quite knowledgeable on an number of topics, and very open to discussing everything except their own pasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9317;I learned so much!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9318;The feast is quite filling, and the jade-armored maidens and the robed men prove to be good company, as does our strange host. The drinks are probably what I enjoy the most, though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9318;Another round!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9319;The feast is quite filling, and the jade-armored maidens and the robed men prove to be good company, as does our immortal host. Unlike many of those present, I recognize the name Anqi Sheng.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9319;This was truly an auspicious evening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9320;The feast is quite filling, and the jade-armored maidens and the robed men prove to be good company, as does our strange host. For some reason, I find myself considering the many virtues of the Taoist faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9320;I will embrace Taoism!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9320;I will convert... secretly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9320;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_9320;My faith is the only true faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9321;The feast is quite filling, and the jade-armored maidens and the robed men prove to be good company, as does our strange host. It is a most enjoyable time, and I almost wish I could stay forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9321;This was a nice evening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9323;The Peach of Immortality;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9323;As we graciously thank our host and the others from the mountain and prepare to leave we are presented with a box that we are told contains a gift from the masters of Mount Penglai. Opening it, we discover a single peach, to the suprise of most of the people from the Treasure Fleet.\n\n"It seems you know a bit less than I assumed," Anqi Sheng says after noticing the confusion on many faces. "I am an immortal, as are all others that are found here. This peach can bestow immortality to whomever consumes it. I trust you can determine the worthiest among you.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9323;A gift fit for the Dragon Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9324;The Fate of the Peach;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9324;As the party heads back towards the Treasure Fleet a fierce debate rages as to what to do with the single Peach of Immortality that we have been given. Some seem to think that they should get to eat it, others that the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven should be offered it, and yet others that none should have it.\n\nHopefully, we can reach a consensus, as it otherwise is quite possible that a fight will break out over the Peach, and considering immortality itself might be on the line such a fight could end up being quite fierce indeed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9324;It belongs to the Dragon Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9324;It belongs to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9324;None are worthy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9326;After a lot of debate, it is decided that the Peach of Immortality is a gift that none are worthy of. The strongest man present is given the task of throwing the Peach off the side of a nearby cliff before anyone can change their mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9326;It is for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9327;After a lot of debate, it is decided that the Peach of Immortality is a gift that none short of the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven are worthy of. We will present it to the Dragon Throne upon the Treasure Fleet's return to the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9327;The Dragon Throne will doubtlessly be pleased!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9328;It soon becomes clear that the matter of the Peach of Immortality will not be resolved peacefully as there is one among us that seeks to claim it for [peach_claimant.GetHerHim]self, rather than giving it to the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9328;This is treason!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9328;The Peach belongs to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9329;It soon becomes clear that the matter of the Peach of Immortality will not be resolved peacefully as there are several people among us that think that the Peach should be given to them and them alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9329;This is treason!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9329;The Peach belongs to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9332;[imperial_champion.GetBestName] leads the effort to ensure that the Peach does indeed end up in the hands of the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, and under [imperial_champion.GetHerHis] leadership we prevail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9332;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9333;[imperial_champion.GetBestName] opposes my attempt to claim the Peach of Immortality, as do all others present. Unfortunately, I am unable to prevail, and [imperial_champion.GetBestName] is not interested in mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9333;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9334;The fight for the fate of the Peach of Immortality does not go as I had hoped. In the end, [best_peach_claimant.GetBestName] prevails, and [best_peach_claimant.GetSheHe] is not interested in showing any mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9334;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9335;I have to fight hard to ensure that I end up with the Peach of Immortality, but I prevail in the end. It is clear that I cannot allow word of my treason against the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven to escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9335;So many unfortunate little accidents...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9338;The return to the Treasure Fleet is uneventful, and we board the ships in good order. After calling a meeting to ensure that everyone knows about the Peach and that it is intended for the Dragon Throne, the Admiral gives the order to sail for the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9338;We sail at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9339;The party that went ashore returns in good spirits, carrying with them a small box. At a meeting called by the Admiral shortly thereafter, I learn that it contains a Peach of Immortality, and that it is to be brought to the Dragon Throne without delay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9339;We sail at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9340;Those of us that went ashore make sure that we all know what to say with regards to what happened ashore ahead of our return to the Treasure Fleet. We will need to mention visiting Mount Penglai, most likely, but not the Peach of Immortality or what happened to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9340;The truth should remain hidden...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9341;Everyone has returned to the ships at last, with the final arrivals announcing that we have visited Mount Penglai. Nothing unusual happened atop the mountain, they tell us, and we need to leave, preferably immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9341;They seem eager to return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9342;I return alone to the Treasure Fleet, having consumed the Peach of Immortality. I will have to mention Mount Penglai, seeing as there are those still alive who heard the leader of the jade-armored maidens name the mountain, but I should be able to keep the Peach a secret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9342;We sail at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9343;[best_peach_claimant.GetBestName] has returned to the Treasure Fleet, bringing word that all of the others that ascended to the summit of Mount Penglai and were not turned back at the gates to the gardens there unfortunately will not be returning. Apparently they all died in a terrible accident of some kind during the journey back to the ships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9343;[best_peach_claimant.GetSheHeCap] must have been lucky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9345;Making Repairs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9345;The Treasure Fleet has been at sea for quite some time, having headed both east and south, without catching sight of land, and some of the ships have started to show signs of wear and tear. Finally, some of the sailors in the mast sight an island ahead, and the command is given to sail towards it.\n\nThe shores of the island are pleasant enough, and some trees can be sighted not far inland. Further away from the water, jagged mountains reach towards the sky, hardly looking inviting at all. No signs of humans can be seen anywhere near the shoreline, and surely none would live further inland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9345;We should make some repairs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9346;Work on the repairs progress well enough, and as the sailors and soldiers are seeing to them under the watchful eyes of quite a lot of people my presence is hardly needed. Perhaps I should take the opportunity to explore the island...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9346;I will head inland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9346;I will stay at the shore...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9348;As I am exploring the base of the mountains at the heart of the island it starts to rain, and I take cover in a nearby cave. Inside, I find a surprisingly large amount of gold and jewels, seemingly human-made, even if I have seen no other signs of humans on the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9348;I should gather it all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9348;It is not mine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9349;As I start gathering the treasures inside the cave, I notice a large golden bracelet and put it on. Feeling suddenly drowsy, I decide to sleep for a bit. Upon awakening, I find myself quite thirsty, and I crawl out to drink from the pond I saw at the base of the mountain. A reptilian face gazes back at me from the water.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9349;Is that... me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9350;The Dragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9350;I am having a well-deserved rest aboard one of the ships when I suddenly hear the sound of shouting from several directions. Investigating the source of the commotion, I see the sentries that were posted on some of the hills overlooking the beach come running, pointing towards the sky.\n\nGazing upwards, I see a massive winged reptilian flying purposefully towards the Treasure Fleet. It lets out several fierce roars as it gets closer, clearly intent on landing somewhere nearby. The soldiers that have been helping out with the repairs are now scrambling to arm and armor themselves to face this dire threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9350;Kill it! Kill it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9351;Not knowing what else to do, I flap the wings I have grown and fly towards the Treasure Fleet. The sentries spot me as I approach, panicking as a result. I come in for a landing while explaining what has happened, but it soon becomes clear that none of them can understand me and that they all see me as a threat to their safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9351;Wait! No! NO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9352;The soldiers manage to overwhelm the dragon easily enough, as it is not really fighting back as much as trying to avoid their attacks. It quickly becomes apparent why, as once the dragon has been slain it reverts into the form of [FromFrom.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9352;We should leave this place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9354;A Trip Ashore;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9354;Having continued on from the last island for quite some time, the Treasure Fleet comes upon a small island that looks rather unremarkable, and that shows no sign of human habitation.\n\nThough it is clear that there is little of interest to the Middle Kingdom as a whole to be found on the island, the Admiral makes the decision to make landfall, noting that we might be able to find some water and possibly wild fruits and berries to add to our supplies. Many of those aboard the ships seem to at least want to stretch their legs for a bit, and I suppose my ship has started to feel a bit confining as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9345;Let's explore a bit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9355;As we explore the island we come across a stream rather far inland. Strangely enough, there seems to be a golden statue below the water, in the shape of a human man. The craftsmanship is exquisite, as it truly looks lifelike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9355;I think I can reach it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9355;Curious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9355;Something is not right here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9356;I take off my clothes and step into the water, noticing that my steps get heavier as I continue further out. Looking down, I see that my feet and lower legs have taken on a golden hue, and as I lift my right foot out of the water I can see it is not just the water playing tricks. I turn around to head back to the shore, but slip as I do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9356;Not like...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9357;Some of those that saw the golden statue decided to attempt to retrieve it from the water, which quickly turned out to be a mistake. The people in question were turned into gold as they submerged themselves in the water, and we could do nothing to save them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9357;This place is cursed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9359;The Darkness;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9359;As the Treasure Fleet continues, we encounter a strange patch of darkness. It is clearly unnatural, seeing as it is the middle of the day, and none aboard can provide an explanation. Some of the sailors think that they can see the shape of an island beneath the darkness, though they admit that it is hard to be certain.\n\nThe Admiral makes the decision that we are to approach the darkness to see what we can find, though he gives every ship the authority to sail back out of the darkness if we think there is cause to do that.\n\nAs we continue towards the possible island, the light dimming with each passing moment, I think I hear a sound ahead that I once might have heard in a dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9359;We must press on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9359;Turn back! TURN BACK!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9360;I take command of the ship and give the order to continue onwards even as several other ships turn back. There is clearly an island ahead, and I hear more and more familiar sounds from it. As we reach the island, I realize that I do indeed recognize aspects of this, but not from my dreams. I recognize them from my nightmares.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9360;NO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9361;My ship turns around, as do several others, but some of the ships continue onwards, towards the sounds that I am starting to realize belong to my worst nightmares. We reach the edge of the darkness, and wait there for the ships that continued to return, but they do not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9361;They're... gone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9363;The Island;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9363;The Treasure Fleet has left the Dark Island behind and has continued on its way for some time. Eventually, the lookouts spot yet another island, and the ships turn towards it.\n\nAs we approach, it is clear that the island might be a bit larger than the one where the waters turned men into golden statues, but it seems largely unremarkable. Still, seeing as the Treasure Fleet's supplies might not be as good as they could be, heading ashore might be prudent, and the Admiral gives the order to make landfall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9363;We should see what we find!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9364;We do not find any signs of humans at first, but then we encounter indisputable signs that there might be some nearby. We come across a large table, upon which a bountiful feast has been laid out. Judging by the state of the food, it is unlikely it has been there for a long time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9364;It's a trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9364;We should leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9364;A feast? How nice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9365;Though some of the others from the Treasure Fleet decide to keep looking for the people that must have prepared the food I and some of the others linger behind and get started on the meal. As we eat and drink, some of the discussions start to turn heated, and I feel a bit insulted by some of the comments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9365;We should not be too hasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9365;Enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9367;I notice a stone knife on the table, and reach towards it, intending to make it clear that I do not appreciate the insults or the threats that have been made at the feast. As my fingers touch it, I start to feel drowsy, and the arguments around me trail off. I can see that everyone at the table seems to be falling asleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9367;What's happ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9368;Our search for those that must have prepared the feast does not bear fruit, and we head back to inform those that stayed to partake of the feast. As we return, we find everyone at the table soundly asleep, and though we try to wake them back up we have no success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9368;This place must be cursed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9369;After the island has been fully explored by those that did not decide to partake of the feast no sign of those that prepared it has been found, and though some have seen fit to eat some of it it is decided to leave the rest of it behind as it fills some with unease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9369;I guess we continue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9371;One day, a sailor unexpectedly falls into the water and needs to be fished back out. To the surprise of everyone aboard the Treasure Fleet, he announces that the waters below are sweet rather than salty, despite us still very clearly being out on the open sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9371;Strange...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9372;The Treasure Fleet has encountered a huge landmass ahead, but as the ships sail closer it becomes apparent that the ocean is narrowing much sooner than expected. The Admiral orders rowboats to be prepared for anyone that wishes to head ashore, and announces that the Treasure Fleet will be turning back once the rowboats return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9372;I will head ashore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9372;I will stay here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9373;The Lion of the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9373;As the rowboats reach the shore I and the others aboard them quickly disembark and start exploring the shoreline. It is clear that there are no humans to be found anywhere close, and we do not have the time to explore far.\n\nJust as we are about to return to the rowboats we notice that we are not alone. A truly massive lion is standing some distance away, looking towards us. It is not making any attempt to get any closer, and none of us attempt to approach it either.\n\nThe lion is quite majestic, and something about it does not feel quite natural, but I cannot say what it is that makes me feel that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9373;I feel a need to bow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9373;I feel more understanding!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9373;My faith grows stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_9373;Curious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9376;The Nightmare Corpse-City;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9376;The Treasure Fleet has been moving both south and east, and it has been several weeks since it last sighted land. One day, however, the lookouts cry out that there is what appears to be a city ahead, and the fleet approaches it quickly despite the fact that it is most unexpected.\n\nAs my ship gets close to this city, I start growing more and more uneasy. More terrified. This strange city is simply not right.\n\nWhatever this place is, it is not of human design, and whatever we will find here might be more than my mind can bear. Even so, I find myself strangely unable to leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9376;We should turn around!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9376;I wonder what lies inside...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9376;I was drawn here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9377;The Dreaming God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9377;Every instinct screams at me to leave this place at once, but I still find myself heading ashore I you cannot leave without exploring this nightmarish city. Strange carvings decorate the walls, which meet at unnatural angles, and the corridors seem to curve impossibly.\n\nI and several others venture deeper into the city, and further down. Eventually, we come across the gargantuan body of an impossible, sanity-defying creature, which appears to be fast asleep.\n\nIt cannot be. It should not be. But it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9377;We must leave at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9377;I wonder what that... thing is...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9377;Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9379;The Stars Are Right;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9379;As the last stragglers return to the Treasure Fleet and word spreads about the sanity-defying creature sleeping within the city, the order is given to set sail for the Middle Kingdom with all haste. However, as the ships are turning around, an impossibly large shape rises above the city, its appearance causing many to go mad on the spot.\n\n"The Stars are Right!" they cry. "The Stars are Right!"\n\nAs much as we would wish to leave the creature's presence, it cannot be allowed to remain, and the Treasure Fleet must see it destroyed, no matter the cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9379;Prepare for battle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9379;He has awakened!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9391;The Treasure Fleet moves closer to the abomination even as sailor after sailor goes insane. Arrows, bolts, fireworks, and other things are launched at the creature, and several ships move to ram it, driven on by some impossible gust of wind. It shrugs off most of the attacks, but eventually it stops moving and sinks beneath the waves once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_SOH_9385;Madness in the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9385;Word has arrived that a half-dead sailor has washed ashore in Java. He claims to have been part of the Treasure Fleet, and that he is the only survivour, as he says that the fleet encountered some kind of unspeakable monstrosity further east and had to sacrifice itself to ensure that the beast would not consume the world.\n\nThe man's tale is certainly outlandish, and his sanity appears questionable at best, but the driftwood washing ashore alongside him is indisputably from the ships of the Treasure Fleet. One way or another, the Treasure Fleet's voyage has come to an end somewhere in the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9385;Most inauspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_9386;So much for that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9386;How auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9387;As the last stragglers return to the Treasure Fleet and word spreads about the sanity-defying creature sleeping within the city, the order is given to set sail for the Middle Kingdom with all haste. The Admiral orders that no mentions are to be made of the city or the creature inside it, stating that some things are best forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9387;It should be left well enough alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9393;The Hole in the World;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9393;The Treasure Fleet has sailed east for quite some time, and has not been within sight of land for a good while. However, one day some of the lookouts spot an island ahead, and the order is given to sail to it.\n\nThe island turns out to be quite small, and it takes little time to confirm that it is uninhabited. However, it contains one very unexpected sight: An impossibly large hole.\n\nLooking down this hole while carefully standing away from the edge, we can glimpse another sea, far, far below, seemingly only illuminated by the light seeping through the hole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9393;There is a sea most sunless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9394;The Great Silence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9394;The Treasure Fleet continues east, sailing into the great unknown. No islands lie ahead, and those behind us soon vanish in the distance. Our supplies are slowly dwindling, as is morale.\n\nThe further east we sail, the more we start to notice an unnatural silence descending on the fleet. The decks creak less as we step on them, the crews grow less and less talkative, and the waves make no sound. It is unbearable.\n\nIn a largely quiet meeting, the Admiral declares that he thinks the time has come for the Treasure Fleet to turn back. None oppose his decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9394;We can't continue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9395;Petals and Pillars;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9395;The Treasure Fleet is heading north, and will have encounted an area of the ocean where pillars of stone will stand and where petals drift on the wind as we have sailed through it.\n\nAs we moved further into this area, we will have seen a city, which will lie here. Lies. Has always lain. I find myself strangely eager to have record what we will have seen, but as I sat down to write I now recall that it was written already. This will be a confusing place, and I will have left it with a headache.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9395;I will have understood this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9396;The Castle in the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9396;Not long after the Treasure Fleet has turned back from the oppressive silence we sail into a strange sea where impossibly large and mostly submerged stone statues stand, their arms reaching for the sky. These statues all seem to be surrounding a strange, foreboding castle.\n\nThere is a power here, all around us, and I get the feeling that it will witness whatever happens, though how I know this I cannot tell. Several of the sailors seem to be feeling it as well, as they look quite uneasy. Still, if I wish for my ship to approach the castle, it will be possible for me to give the command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9396;Approach the castle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9396;Leave;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9397;A Place of Power;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9397;The power in the air grows even more intense as the ship enters the castle, and it keeps growing as I head ashore with many sailors from the crew. It witnesses. It hungers.\n\nThis place was built for a reason, and that reason is sacrifice. Perhaps we are here to make a sacrifice, or perhaps we should depart before I become one...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9397;Lose your mind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9397;Eat your crew;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9397;Leave;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9400;Through the Storm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9400;As the Treasure Fleet continues east we encounter a raging storm that seems far too large to attempt to sail around. The Admiral gives the command to press on, despite the misgivings of many aboard the ships, and press on the Treasure Fleet does.\n\nSeveral ships lose their masts to the fierce winds or unlucky lightning strikes and fall behind, and some unfortunate ships are smashed apart or even tipped over by the waves. In such dangerous circumstances, attempting a rescue is impossible, and the loss of life is large.\n\nEventually, though, we pass through the storm, finding ourselves approaching a fairly sizeable island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9400;We should make landfall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9401;Welcomed Ashore;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9401;The landmass the Treasure Fleet has encountered turns out to be inhabited, and our ships make their way towards the nearest port without delay. We can see a large number of locals watching the Treasure Fleet's approach from near the docks as the ships sail into the harbour.\n\nAs soon as the ships have tied up the locals send messengers to invite us ashore, and all those of note disembark alongside the Admiral, curious as to what kind of welcome we should expect. The locals appear to be unarmed, excepting a handful of guards, so it is unlikely that we are in any danger.\n\nWe are brought before a man who introduces himself as the governor of the port we have arrived at, and are invited to accompany him to an audience with the ruler of the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9401;Take us to your leader!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9402;The Ancient Queen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9402;The party from the Treasure Fleet are brought some distance inland to a city laid out in an orderly pattern. We are led through the city, past gawking crowds of locals, to the entrance of a palace fit for the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven [treasure_fleet_sender.GetHerHim]self, and are invited inside by the officials who have come to greet us.\n\nInside, we are taken to a large throne room, and find ourselves facing an ancient-looking woman seated on an ornate throne. She asks us about the situation in the Middle Kingdom, with some of the questions seeming to indicate that whatever she has heard of it is not recent.\n\nAfter satisfying her curiosity, the queen invites us to a feast meant to commemorate her birthday.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9402;A feast? Why not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9403;The Thousand Handmaidens;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9403;Among the many locals invited to the feast are the queen's handmaidens, who apparently number an even thousand if the locals are to be believed. Unlike their mistress they serve, the handmaidens are all quite young, though no less courteous than the queen.\n\nSeeing as the handmaidens outnumber the other guests, it is unsurprising that I find myself seated next to one of them, and I find myself spending the evening conversing with her. She is quite interested in hearing about the places I have seen, both during the Treasure Fleet's voyage and before it, and wistfully says that she wishes that she could travel abroad, though apparently she and the other handmaidens are expected to take part in an important ceremony soon and will not be able to depart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9403;I hope things go well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9403;Come with me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9404;The Young Queen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9404;We are invited to yet another audience with the queen of these lands following her birthday party, and once more enter the grand halls of her palace accompanied by various local notables.\n\nTo our great surprise, there is a different woman seated on the throne, far younger than the queen we met in the past. I discreetly inquire with one of the locals if the old queen has abdicated, or even passed away unexpectedly, and the man gives me a look that makes it clear he thinks I must be a fool.\n\nThe young woman on the throne speaks to us as if she indeed met with us not long ago, and the manner in which she speaks is eerily similar to the manner in which the old queen spoke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9404;I think I recognize her...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9404;Something seems strange here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9405;The Departure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9405;After the second, strange audience the party from the Treasure Fleet is brought back to the harbour and taken back to the ships. The sailors that were left behind are quick to report that the locals have been most accommodating and have provided plentiful supplies for the return voyage. Moreover, the storm we sailed through has dissipated, which should make the passage back to familiar lands much easier.\n\nThe Admiral orders the Treasure Fleet to depart as soon as everyone has come back aboard the ships, and the departure is quite uneventful. However, as the island starts to fall beneath the horizon stormclouds start forming in our wake, once more making the approach to the island dangerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9405;What a curious place...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9408;The Grand Armada;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9408;One day the lookouts call out that there are a great many sails on the horizon. As they clearly must be a sign of civilization ahead, the Admiral gives the command for the Treasure Fleet to attempt to approach the other ships, which turns out to be easy enough as they are moving on an intercept course.\n\nWe soon find ourselves approached by thousands of single-sailed ships with banks of oars on each side, each carrying a large ballista and a large number of armored soldiers either wielding spears or bows. They quickly move to surround the Treasure Fleet, if in a manner suggesting peaceful intentions.\n\nSome kind of officer requests permission to come aboard, extending an invite for the Treasure Fleet to visit their homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9408;I don't think we can refuse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9409;The Orichalcum Citadel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9409;The Treasure Fleet soon approaches a large landmass, where the ships escorting us lead our ships up a wide canal, its mouth flanked by a pair of massive cities of white stone. Our destination lies inland, it would seem.\n\nThe journey inland continues for days, until we finally approach a truly massive city ringed by layers of walls, several of them apparently covered with precious metals. We are led ashore and are escorted through the city by thousands of armored soldiers, finally approaching a citadel with walls of a strange reddish metal the locals apparently call orichalcum.\n\nInside, we are brought into the presence of the ten kings who apparently rule the island, who offer to host a celebration for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9409;I suppose we can stay for a while...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9411;The food and the quality of the entertainment at the celebration hosted by the ten kings are without compare. It seems this place lacks for nothing, and that the Admiral made the right decision to bring the Treasure Fleet here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9411;I'm having a great time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9412;Many of the other guests at the celebration hosted by the ten kings turn out to be local scholars. They ask many questions about the Middle Kingdom and other lands, but also turn out to be quite eager to share some of what they know about a number of things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9412;I learned a lot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9413;As the first evening of the celebration hosted by the ten kings ends I and the others from the Treasure Fleet are taken to our quarters in the Orichalcum Citadel. I have a hard time falling asleep and decide to have a look around, discovering a room containing several maps, along with some notes that look like invasion plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9413;What have we told them...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9415;I and some of the other officials from the Treasure Fleet are conversing with the ten kings, who seem quite interested in hearing more about the Middle Kingdom, when a messenger bursts in, announcing that a formerly dormant volcano not long from the capital city has erupted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9415;That's unexpected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9416;Not long after we hear about the volcanic eruption I can feel the ground beneath my feet moving slightly. At first, I think I might be imagining things, but then it happens again, and several loose objects on a nearby table starts to shake. The shaking grows more pronounced, and the objects start falling over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9416;I have a bad feeling about this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9417;The earthquakes grow worse and worse, and judging by the way the ten kings are reacting they are not common in this place. As they are arguing about what to do, another messenger arrives, bringing word that the island appears to have started to sink beneath the waves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9417;Back to the ships!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9418;The Sinking Island;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9418;The locals make no attempt to bar our way as we return to the Treasure Fleet in a hurry, which is understandable as they seem quite preoccupied with trying to determine what to do about the disaster that has struck the island.\n\nAs the Treasure Fleet heads back towards the mouth of the canal, it is quite apparent that the island is rapidly disappearing beneath the waves, seeing as the canal appears to be widening the closer to the coastline we get.\n\nThe twin cities flanking the mouth of the canal are almost entirely submerged by the time we reach them, and though some of the locals' ships appear to be trying to rescue the people they might require assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9418;We cannot save them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9418;We should help them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9419;My ship and several others assist the local ships with the rescue efforts, and we are able to save a few of the locals, including a few of noble birth. They are clearly quite distraught by what has happened, and quite grateful to have been saved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9419;I'm sure I can find a place for you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9420;We attempt to assist with the rescue attempts, but have little luck finding survivours. The captains of the local ships politely refuse the offer to return to the Middle Kingdom with the Treasure Fleet, instead opting to look for survivours elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9420;I wish them luck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9423;The Great Island;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9423;The Treasure Fleet was attempting to sail east, but thanks to strong currents and winds it has been moving south and west for some time, with no land in sight for weeks. One day, however, the lookouts finally announce that that has changed.\n\nApproaching the landmass ahead of us, it soon becomes clear that it is quite large, and as we get even closer it is clear that there is a number of busy ports to be found.\n\nThe Admiral orders the Treasure Fleet to spread out, as normal, so that as many of the local ports as possible can be visited. My ship is dispatched towards one of the larger ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9423;I'm sure they will welcome us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9425;The port I visit contains a very large literary academy, where the scholars are quite eager to meet with someone from a distant land. Their collection is quite extensive, and they are more than willing to let me read a number of books that catch my interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9425;Inspiring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9426;I spend some time ashore, visiting the sights and meeting with a number of interesting people. As I am about to return to my ship, a very beautiful young woman approaches me. She makes it clear that the likes what she sees and suggests that perhaps she could join me aboard my ship. I have little trouble understanding her meaning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9426;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9426;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9427;I spend some time ashore, visiting the sights and meeting with a number of interesting people. As I am about to return to my ship, a very beautiful young man approaches me. He makes it clear that the likes what he sees and suggests that perhaps he could join me aboard my ship. I have little trouble understanding his meaning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9427;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9427;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9428;There are many sights to be seen in this unfamiliar land, including a number of grand temple complexes located close to the shoreline. They appear partially submerged, for the most part, but that does nothing to detract from their beauty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9428;I am glad we came here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9429;As the Treasure Fleet gaters once more and we prepare to depart the Admiral reveals that the locals have provided him with some information regarding the nearby ocean currents, some of which should take the Treasure Fleet towards the southern tip of India.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9429;To India, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9432;The Island of Statues;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9432;The Treasure Fleet has continued east for quite some time now, and it has been a good while since it has been close to land. However, one day the lookouts call out that there is an island on the horizon, and the order is given to sail towards it.\n\nThe island we have encountered is fairly small, and there does not appear to be any humans living there, but there must have been a human presence there at some point as I can see hundreds of stone statues looking out over the waters. They might warrant further investigation, and we might as well head ashore for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9432;We should have a look around!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9433;The statues on the island are quite impressive to look at, even if I am uncertain as to why they have been constructed. I have discussed the matter with some other people from the Treasure Fleet, and the only thing we have been able to conclude is that they perhaps might warrant further study.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9433;They must be studied!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9433;Surely they fulfill some mystical purpose!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9433;Actually, they bore me already...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9434;It is clear from the statues found across the island that it used to be inhabited at some point, and though it is abandoned at present we have managed to come across the ruins of a village. We cannot make out much from what remains, though we do discover a few interesting things worth pondering further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9434;Curious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9435;It is quite pleasant to have land under my feet once more, and the weather is quite good at present as well. Once it is clear that there are no immediate dangers in the area, I decide that it is well worth relaxing for a while, as it is uncertain when the Treasure Fleet will encounter land the next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9435;I needed this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9436;Though it is possible that there might yet be things to discover on the island the Admiral has announced that it is time to depart. After all, the Treasure Fleet is looking for trade opportunities and opportunities to show off the might of the Middle Kingdom, neither of which can be done here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9436;We must sail on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9437;The Islands of the Turtles;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9437;The Treasure Fleet has not been within sight of land for several weeks when the lookouts call out that land has been spotted to the north and the east. The order is given to head towards it, and as we get closer I can see that we have encountered a group of islands.\n\nThe ships move in between the islands, looking for signs of civilization, but as best I can tell the islands are not inhabited by humans. Instead, I can see all manner of exotic animals, including what looks like extraordinarily large turtles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9437;We should have a look around!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9438;The supply situation for the Treasure Fleet is not as good as I would like, not even after some intial foraging across the islands we have encountered. Some of the sailors from my ship are suggesting that the giant turtles should be hunted for food, and after some deliberation it has been decided that I have the final say in the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9438;We need the food!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9438;We should not harm them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9439;Though we have been unable to find any settlements in the islands we have encountered it has become clear that we are not the first humans that have visited, seeing as some of the people with the Treasure Fleet have returned with shards of pottery unlike any we have seen elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9439;Curious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9440;The islands we have encountered are clearly volcanic in nature, as the shape of the mountains is unmistakeable. Initially, the volcanoes were thought to be dormant, but one day one of them erupts without warning, and though it is a majestic sight to behold it is far too dangerous to linger in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9440;We can't stay much longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9441;It is quite pleasant to have land under my feet once more, and the weather is quite good at present as well. Once it is clear that there are no immediate dangers in the area, I decide that it is well worth relaxing for a while, as it is uncertain when the Treasure Fleet will encounter land the next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_9442;We must sail on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
