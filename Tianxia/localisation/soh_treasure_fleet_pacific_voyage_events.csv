EVTTITLE_SOH_9303;Pillars Touching the Clouds;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9303;Last night, the Treasure Fleet sailed into a thick mist, despite the misgivings of some of the sailors aboard. We have managed to continue east even so, and shortly after dawn the mists started to dissipate, revealing an unexpected sight in front of us.\n\nWe are approaching an island, still some distance away. It is hard to make out any details as of yet, save for there being a majestic mountain at the heart of the island, surrounded by tall pillar-like rock formations that seem to be teeming with vegetation of some kind. Something atop the mountain appears to be gleaming, as if made from metal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9303;Could it be...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9303;This feels familiar...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9303;What is this place...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9304;The Ancient Shipwrecks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9304;As the Treasure Fleet approaches the shore of the mysterious island some of the sailors notice something unexpected and call out. A large number of shipwrecks lie just off the shore, each ship at least as large as those of the Treasure Fleet, all of them looking impossibly ancient.\n\nAs we draw closer, some sharp-eyed scholars aboard manage to decipher the two characters written on the sails of the fleet in ancient seal script and loudly announce what they read: "Qin" and "Han".\n\nIt would seem the decaying ships originated from the Middle Kingdom, though not recently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9304;We must investigate this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9304;This is a bad sign!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9306;The Stairway to the Heavens;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9306;The party that headed ashore has now reached the base of the mountain at the center of the island, with the journey so far being most uneventful. So far, no signs of civilization have been encountered since coming ashore, whether along the path the main party has taken or the trails the scouts have followed.\n\nExploring the base of the mountain, it is discovered that its slopes are far too steep to attempt to climb, but that that will not be necessary. Strangely enough, a stone staircase wide enough that a hundred [Root.GetMenWomen] could climb it as one, has been located, leading up the mountain towards the metallic gleam above.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9306;We continue on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9306;I will turn back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9307;Palaces of Gold and Silver;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9307;The party from the Treasure Fleet has now made its way more than halfway to the summit of the mountain, as best as anyone has been able to determine. The broad staircase at the bottom of the mountain ended at the start of a winding path along the side of the mountain, which led to another equally broad staircase, then another winding path, and so on.\n\nAs we reach the base of the next staircase, we finally get a good look at what is located at the snow-capped summit, finding it to be a large number of palaces of gold and silver, surrounded by what appears to be a walled garden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9307;A wondrous sight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9308;The Jade-Armored Maidens;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9308;The final staircase leads to a broad path that continues on towards a set of gates that seem to lead towards a lush garden, judging by the treets that can be glimpsed over the top of the wall. The party continues towards them, between ranks of ornately carved statues of green jade.\n\n"Halt!" a voice suddenly calls out as the statues flanking the path suddenly start to move. Looking at them more closely, I can see that what I thought was a bunch of statues instead are beautiful women armored and armed with jade.\n\n"Who approaches the summit of Mount Penglai?" the speaker demands, stepping up in front of the gates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9308;A humble visitor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9308;Someone that deserves to enter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9308;A weary traveller!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_9308;Someone seeking immortality!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9309;The speaker, who seems to be the leader of the strangely adorned women, considers my words for a moment and then nods, almost imperceptibly.\n\n"You may pass.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9309;You have my thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9310;The speaker, who seems to be the leader of the strangely adorned women, considers my words for a moment and then shakes her head, almost imperceptibly.\n\n"You may not pass.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9310;I don't think I should insist...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9312;Peach Trees and Lotus Flowers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9312;Those who are permitted to pass the gates to the gardens are led inside, escorted by the women in jade, who also make certain that everyone that has been turned back does not think to follow.\n\nInside the walls, we come upon a truly massive garden, growing as if in the heart of summer despite the snow found just outside the walls. A multitude of colorful flowers can be seen throughout the garden, including what looks like lotuses aside from their strange colors, and a great many peach trees grow between the many ponds and streams. We can also see a number of young men, dressed in robes fit for officials in an era long gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9312;Such a fascinating place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9313;The Great Table;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9313;On the other side of the garden we discover an impossibly large table upon which a truly spectacular feast has been readied. As we approach, a man in a very elaborate robe suddenly appears in front of us, as if out of nowhere.\n\n"Welcome!" the man proclaims, inclining his head slightly. "I am Anqi Sheng. The true masters of Mount Penglai are absent at this time, I am afraid, but I am sure they would not wish for me to send you on your way without first offering you a feast on their behalf.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9313;A feast? Certainly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9315;The feast is quite filling, and the jade-armored maidens and the robed men prove to be good company, as does our strange host. I find myself feeling as if my life once more has purpose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9315;I needed this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9316;The feast is quite filling, and the jade-armored maidens and the robed men prove to be good company, as does our strange host. As the evening progresses, I find myself able to relax for the first time in a long while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9316;I feel like a new person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9317;The feast is quite filling, and the jade-armored maidens and the robed men prove to be good company, as does our strange host. They are quite knowledgeable on an number of topics, and very open to discussing everything except their own pasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9317;I learned so much!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9318;The feast is quite filling, and the jade-armored maidens and the robed men prove to be good company, as does our strange host. The drinks are probably what I enjoy the most, though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9318;Another round!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9319;The feast is quite filling, and the jade-armored maidens and the robed men prove to be good company, as does our immortal host. Unlike many of those present, I recognize the name Anqi Sheng.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9319;This was truly an auspicious evening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9320;The feast is quite filling, and the jade-armored maidens and the robed men prove to be good company, as does our strange host. For some reason, I find myself considering the many virtues of the Taoist faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9320;I will embrace Taoism!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9320;I will convert... secretly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9320;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_9320;My faith is the only true faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9321;The feast is quite filling, and the jade-armored maidens and the robed men prove to be good company, as does our strange host. It is a most enjoyable time, and I almost wish I could stay forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9321;This was a nice evening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9323;The Peach of Immortality;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9323;As we graciously thank our host and the others from the mountain and prepare to leave we are presented with a box that we are told contains a gift from the masters of Mount Penglai. Opening it, we discover a single peach, to the suprise of most of the people from the Treasure Fleet.\n\n"It seems you know a bit less than I assumed," Anqi Sheng says after noticing the confusion on many faces. "I am an immortal, as are all others that are found here. This peach can bestow immortality to whomever consumes it. I trust you can determine the worthiest among you.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9323;A gift fit for the Dragon Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9324;The Fate of the Peach;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9324;As the party heads back towards the Treasure Fleet a fierce debate rages as to what to do with the single Peach of Immortality that we have been given. Some seem to think that they should get to eat it, others that the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven should be offered it, and yet others that none should have it.\n\nHopefully, we can reach a consensus, as it otherwise is quite possible that a fight will break out over the Peach, and considering immortality itself might be on the line such a fight could end up being quite fierce indeed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9324;It belongs to the Dragon Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9324;It belongs to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9324;None are worthy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9326;After a lot of debate, it is decided that the Peach of Immortality is a gift that none are worthy of. The strongest man present is given the task of throwing the Peach off the side of a nearby cliff before anyone can change their mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9326;It is for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9327;After a lot of debate, it is decided that the Peach of Immortality is a gift that none short of the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven are worthy of. We will present it to the Dragon Throne upon the Treasure Fleet's return to the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9327;The Dragon Throne will doubtlessly be pleased!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9328;It soon becomes clear that the matter of the Peach of Immortality will not be resolved peacefully as there is one among us that seeks to claim it for [peach_claimant.GetHerHim]self, rather than giving it to the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9328;This is treason!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9328;The Peach belongs to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9329;It soon becomes clear that the matter of the Peach of Immortality will not be resolved peacefully as there are several people among us that think that the Peach should be given to them and them alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9329;This is treason!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9329;The Peach belongs to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9332;[imperial_champion.GetBestName] leads the effort to ensure that the Peach does indeed end up in the hands of the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, and under [imperial_champion.GetHerHis] leadership we prevail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9332;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9333;[imperial_champion.GetBestName] opposes my attempt to claim the Peach of Immortality, as do all others present. Unfortunately, I am unable to prevail, and [imperial_champion.GetBestName] is not interested in mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9333;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9334;The fight for the fate of the Peach of Immortality does not go as I had hoped. In the end, [best_peach_claimant.GetBestName] prevails, and [best_peach_claimant.GetSheHe] is not interested in showing any mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9334;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9335;I have to fight hard to ensure that I end up with the Peach of Immortality, but I prevail in the end. It is clear that I cannot allow word of my treason against the [treasure_fleet_sender.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven to escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9335;So many unfortunate little accidents...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9338;The return to the Treasure Fleet is uneventful, and we board the ships in good order. After calling a meeting to ensure that everyone knows about the Peach and that it is intended for the Dragon Throne, the Admiral gives the order to sail for the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9338;We sail at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9339;The party that went ashore returns in good spirits, carrying with them a small box. At a meeting called by the Admiral shortly thereafter, I learn that it contains a Peach of Immortality, and that it is to be brought to the Dragon Throne without delay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9339;We sail at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9340;Those of us that went ashore make sure that we all know what to say with regards to what happened ashore ahead of our return to the Treasure Fleet. We will need to mention visiting Mount Penglai, most likely, but not the Peach of Immortality or what happened to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9340;The truth should remain hidden...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9341;Everyone has returned to the ships at last, with the final arrivals announcing that we have visited Mount Penglai. Nothing unusual happened atop the mountain, they tell us, and we need to leave, preferably immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9341;They seem eager to return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9342;I return alone to the Treasure Fleet, having consumed the Peach of Immortality. I will have to mention Mount Penglai, seeing as there are those still alive who heard the leader of the jade-armored maidens name the mountain, but I should be able to keep the Peach a secret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9342;We sail at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9343;[best_peach_claimant.GetBestName] has returned to the Treasure Fleet, bringing word that all of the others that ascended to the summit of Mount Penglai and were not turned back at the gates to the gardens there unfortunately will not be returning. Apparently they all died in a terrible accident of some kind during the journey back to the ships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9343;[best_peach_claimant.GetSheHeCap] must have been lucky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9345;Making Landfall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9345
EVTOPTA_SOH_9345;We should make some repairs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9346
EVTOPTA_SOH_9346;I will head inland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9346;I will stay at the shore...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9348
EVTOPTA_SOH_9348;I will rest for a bit...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9348;I will head back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9349
EVTOPTA_SOH_9349;What's happening to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9350;The Dragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_9345;We should check for supplies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9355
EVTOPTA_SOH_9355;I think I can reach it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9355;Not all that interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9355;Something is not right here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9356
EVTOPTA_SOH_9356;Not like...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_9363;We should see what we find!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9364
EVTOPTA_SOH_9364;It's a trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9364;We should leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9364;A feast? How nice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9365
EVTOPTA_SOH_9365;I should not be too hasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9365;Enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_9367;What's happ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9368

EVTDESC_SOH_9376
EVTOPTA_SOH_9376;We should turn around!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9376;I wonder what lies inside...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_9391
EVTOPTA_SOH_9381;We did it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_9382;That is not dead which can eternal lie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9393
EVTOPTA_SOH_9383;At least we killed it... right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9394
EVTOPTA_SOH_9384;But the Stars were right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9385;Madness in the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_SOH_9418;We should help them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_9419;We'll take you with us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9420

EVTTITLE_SOH_9423;The Great Island;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9423
EVTOPTA_SOH_9423;That's a large island!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9425
EVTOPTA_SOH_9425;Inspiring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9426
EVTOPTA_SOH_9426;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9426;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9427
EVTOPTA_SOH_9427;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9427;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9428
EVTOPTA_SOH_9428;Most curious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9429
EVTOPTA_SOH_9429;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9432;The Island of Statues;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9432;The Treasure Fleet has continued east for quite some time now, and it has been a good while since it has been close to land. However, one day the lookouts call out that there is an island on the horizon, and the order is given to sail towards it.\n\nThe island we have encountered is fairly small, and there does not appear to be any humans living there, but there must have been a human presence there at some point as I can see hundreds of stone statues looking out over the waters. They might warrant further investigation, and we might as well head ashore for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9432;We should have a look around!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9433;The statues on the island are quite impressive to look at, even if I am uncertain as to why they have been constructed. I have discussed the matter with some other people from the Treasure Fleet, and the only thing we have been able to conclude is that they perhaps might warrant further study.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9433;They must be studied!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9433;Surely they fulfill some mystical purpose!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_9433;Actually, they bore me already...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9434;It is clear from the statues found across the island that it used to be inhabited at some point, and though it is abandoned at present we have managed to come across the ruins of a village. We cannot make out much from what remains, though we do discover a few interesting things worth pondering further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9434;Curious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9435;It is quite pleasant to have land under my feet once more, and the weather is quite good at present as well. Once it is clear that there are no immediate dangers in the area, I decide that it is well worth relaxing for a while, as it is uncertain when the Treasure Fleet will encounter land the next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9435;I needed this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9436;Though it is possible that there might yet be things to discover on the island the Admiral has announced that it is time to depart. After all, the Treasure Fleet is looking for trade opportunities and opportunities to show off the might of the Middle Kingdom, neither of which can be done here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9436;We must sail on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_9437;The Islands of the Turtles;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9437;The Treasure Fleet has not been within sight of land for several weeks when the lookouts call out that land has been spotted to the north and the east. The order is given to head towards it, and as we get closer I can see that we have encountered a group of islands.\n\nThe ships move in between the islands, looking for signs of civilization, but as best I can tell the islands are not inhabited by humans. Instead, I can see all manner of exotic animals, including what looks like extraordinarily large turtles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9437;We should have a look around!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9438;The supply situation for the Treasure Fleet is not as good as I would like, not even after some intial foraging across the islands we have encountered. Some of the sailors from my ship are suggesting that the giant turtles should be hunted for food, and after some deliberation it has been decided that I have the final say in the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9438;We need the food!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_9438;We should not harm them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9439;Though we have been unable to find any settlements in the islands we have encountered it has become clear that we are not the first humans that have visited, seeing as some of the people with the Treasure Fleet have returned with shards of pottery unlike any we have seen elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9439;Curious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9440;The islands we have encountered are clearly volcanic in nature, as the shape of the mountains is unmistakeable. Initially, the volcanoes were thought to be dormant, but one day one of them erupts without warning, and though it is a majestic sight to behold it is far too dangerous to linger in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9440;We can't stay much longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9441;It is quite pleasant to have land under my feet once more, and the weather is quite good at present as well. Once it is clear that there are no immediate dangers in the area, I decide that it is well worth relaxing for a while, as it is uncertain when the Treasure Fleet will encounter land the next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_9441;I needed this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_9442;Though it is possible that there might yet be things to discover on the island the Admiral has announced that it is time to depart.
