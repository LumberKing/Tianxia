EVTTITLE_SOH_7703;The End of the Treasure Fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7703;The Dragon Throne stands empty, and [treasure_fleet_sender.GetBestName]'s Treasure Fleet has ceased to have a purpose, seeing as there is no imperial dynasty that can show off its might.\nShould a new ruler successfully claim the Mandate of Heaven and the Dragon Throne, a new Treasure Fleet might be dispatched to show the might of the new imperial dynasty, assuming the new Son of Heaven sees it as a worthy endeavour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7703;To be expected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7703;I should see to matters at home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_7704;The End of the Treasure Fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7704;[eoc.GetBestName] now sits on the Dragon Throne, but [eoc.GetSheHe] has not seen fit to claim the Mandate of Heaven. As a result, the Treasure Fleet no longer serves a purpose, seeing as it is a symbol of the might of the imperial dynasty.\nShould [eoc.GetBestName] or [eoc.GetHerHis] successors see fit to claim the Mandate of Heaven and [eoc.GetHerHis] position as the [eoc.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, [eoc.GetSheHe] might also see fit to dispatch a new Treasure Fleet to show of the might of [eoc.GetHerHis] imperial dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7704;So much for that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7704;I suppose I should head home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_7704;This suits me just fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_7704;First the Dragon Throne, then the Treasure Fleet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_7705;The End of the Treasure Fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7705;[eoc.GetBestName], the [eoc.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, now sits on the Dragon Throne, and [eoc.GetSheHe] has thus successfully claimed the Mandate of Heaven from [treasure_fleet_sender.GetBestName]'s imperial dynasty. As such, it is clear that the Treasure Fleet that was meant to display the might of [treasure_fleet_sender.GetBestName]'s imperial dynasty serves no purpose.\nPerhaps the new [eoc.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven will see fit to dispatch a new Treasure Fleet, though as [eoc.GetHerHis] dynasty might last for ten thousand years such an endeavour might not be undertaken for some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7705;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7705;Very well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_7705;An intriguing idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_7705;Is there no end to the bad news?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_7706;The End of the Treasure Fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7706;It is known that [eoc.GetBestName] does not care for the Mandate of Heaven despite possessing the Dragon Throne, and as the Treasure Fleet is a symbol of the imperial dynasty's might and the [eoc.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's rightful claim to possess the Mandate it no longer serves a purpose.\nShould [eoc.GetBestName] or [eoc.GetHerHis] successors see fit to claim the Mandate of Heaven, they might of course order the undertaking of a new Treasure Fleet expedition, but for the time being such things are not to be expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7706;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7706;I guess it is time to head home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_7706;The Mandate of Heaven is too much trouble...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_7707;The End of the Treasure Fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7707;For one reason or another, the Treasure Fleet and its voyage have become unfeasible. Perhaps a new expedition might be undertaken in the future, should the Dragon Throne see it as a worthwhile endeavour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7707;Curious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_7707;I need to go home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_7707;Well, that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7713;I have finally returned home from the long voyage I undertook as part of the Treasure Fleet. I might need some time to get used to being at home once again, seeing as I have been away for some time, but it feels good to be home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7713;I wonder what I have missed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7714;My ship has finally returned following the unexpected end of the Treasure Fleet's voyage. I might need some time to get used to being at home once again, seeing as I have been away for some time, but it feels good to be home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7714;Not the way I expected to return...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_7715;I had expected my return home to be rather more triumphant when I left aboard one of the Treasure Fleet's ships, but [treasure_fleet_invader.GetBestName]'s sudden yet inevitable betrayal put an end to that, and I was lucky to escape death or captivity at [treasure_fleet_invader.GetHerHis] hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_7715;That went... poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
