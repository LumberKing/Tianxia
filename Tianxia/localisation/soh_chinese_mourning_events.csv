EVTDESCA_SOH_5703;My [GetFromFromRelation], [FromFrom.GetBestName], has died. Due to my station, I am not expected to mourn for the traditional three years, and may substitute thirty-six months of mourning for thirty-six days. Not mourning at all, however, may still cause significant anger towards me, possibly even jeopardizing my position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_5703;My [GetFromFromRelation], [FromFrom.GetBestName], has died. Due to my station, I am only expected to mourn for one year out of the traditional three. Mourning for less than that will cause significant anger towards me, and not mourning would seriously jeopardize my position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_SOH_5703;My [GetFromFromRelation], [FromFrom.GetBestName], has died. Due to my station, I am expected to mourn for the full three years. Less than that would cause significant anger towards me, and mourning too little would seriously jeopardize my position. Not mourning would almost certainly lead to my imprisonment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_SOH_5703;My [GetFromFromRelation], [FromFrom.GetBestName], has died. In addition, I have violated the fundamental assumptions of CK2 and am playing as a baron/courtier. I will now contact a developer to debug this event, because this is certainly not supposed to happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5703;I will mourn for the full three years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5703;Three years is too much, a year is enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5703;I will substitute months of mourning with days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_5703;I refuse to mourn [FromFrom.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5704;My vassal, [From.GetBestName], has refused to mourn his ancestor for the period demanded of him by our culture. Tradition demands that I take action... perhaps stripping him of his titles would be an appropriate action?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5704;He will be demoted for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5704;I literally don't care...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5705;My vassal, [From.GetBestName], has refused to mourn his ancestor for the period demanded of him by our culture. Tradition demands that I take action... perhaps a demotion and a stay in the dungeon will remind him of his duties of filial piety?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5705;It certainly would!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5705;I literally don't care...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5706;My [GetFromFromRelation], [FromFrom.GetBestName], has died. As I am already in mourning, it is only right and proper for me to extend my mourning period.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5706;So it must be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_SOH_5707;My [GetFromFromRelation], [FromFrom.GetBestName], has died. I am not capable of mourning... or much of anything...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SOH_5707;My [GetFromFromRelation], [FromFrom.GetBestName], has died, according to my jailors. I am in no position to engage in proper mourning from here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_SOH_5707;My [GetFromFromRelation], [FromFrom.GetBestName], has died. Unfortunately, the current conflict means that I cannot afford to mourn [FromFrom.GetHerHim] at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_SOH_5707;My [GetFromFromRelation], [FromFrom.GetBestName], has died. It is hardly possible to mourn aboard the Treasure Fleet, so it will have to wait until my return to the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_SOH_5707;My [GetFromFromRelation], [FromFrom.GetBestName], has died. As I am not at home, I cannot engage in proper mourning at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCF_SOH_5707;My [GetFromFromRelation], [FromFrom.GetBestName], has died. Unfortunately, the current need to seclude myself with my courtiers means that I cannot yet mourn [FromFrom.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCG_SOH_5707;My [GetFromFromRelation], [FromFrom.GetBestName], has died, according to a message that has reached the location where I am currently hiding. I would have to come out into the open to engage in proper mourning, and this might not be the time for that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCH_SOH_5707;My [GetFromFromRelation], [FromFrom.GetBestName], has died. Unfortunately, my pregnancy is currently at a stage where I cannot engage in proper mourning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCI_SOH_5707;My [GetFromFromRelation], [FromFrom.GetBestName], has died. Current events mean I need to postpone the mourning to some extent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5707;I must mourn later!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5707;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5711;It is rather well known that [From.GetBestName] has not properly mourned one or more of [From.GetHerHis] ancestors, if originally with good cause. At present, however, [From.GetSheHe] has little excuse not to mourn, and some would say it would be quite unseemly for [From.GetHerHim] to delay things any further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5711;[From.GetSheHeCap] will hear from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5711;I don't particularly care...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5712;[From.GetBestName] has sent a messenger to inform me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that it is time for me to engage in a customary period of mourning as I have failed to mourn at least one of my ancestors. While phrased as a kind reminder, I suspect that it is more of a direct command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5712;I was just getting to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5712;Me, mourn? You must be joking!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5713;I have just been informed that [From.GetBestName] has announced [From.GetHerHis] intention to engage in a period of mourning. It seems the messenger I sent to [From.GetHerHim] got my point across.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5713;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5714;The messenger I sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned, bringing word that [From.GetSheHe] has no intention of mourning [From.GetHerHis] unmourned ancestors. Clearly, [From.GetSheHe] has no respect for propriety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5714;I gave you every opportunity...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5716;Several of my relatives have expressed concern over me not mourning my ancestors in an appropriate manner. They seem to think that this brings dishonor on the whole of my family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5716;I was just getting to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5716;Surely I have more important things to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5717;Many prominent Confucians have expressed concern over the fact that I have not properly mourned one or more of my ancestors. They seem quite insistent that it would be an appropriate display of filial piety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5717;I was just getting to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5717;Surely I have more important things to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5718;My councillors have been grumbling quite a bit recently because I have not seen fit to engage in a proper period of mourning. They are apparently quite certain that my realm would be in good hands during my absence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5718;I was just getting to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5718;Surely I have more important things to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5719;I have learned that a number of my vassals are starting to become less than happy due to me not properly mourning one or more of my ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5719;I was just getting to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5719;Surely I have more important things to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5720;I seem to be losing quite a bit of respect from the people around me, particularly those with a scholarly or religious mind. It probably has to do with the fact that I have not mourned all of my ancestors properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5720;I was just getting to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5720;Surely I have more important things to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5721;A war has been declared against my realm. Although the full duration of mourning is not yet over, the defense of my people and land is more important. I cannot allow grief to hinder me, and unfortunately my mourning is at a premature end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5721;My ancestors smile upon me. Can you say the same?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5722;I have been imprisoned, and as such it is impossible for me to countinue to mourn [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] in an appropriate manner. I have no choice but to end the mourning period early.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5722;Yet another reason why this is unjust!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5724;As a [Root.Culture.GetName] [Root.Religion.GetName] the whole concept of engaging in a long period of mourning for an ancestor like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] feels rather excessive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5724;I don't care for such nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5726;I am no longer capable of taking care of myself... and clearly not capable of mourning either...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5726;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5727;I am sitting around in my family mansion one day when one of my servants approaches me timidly. "My [Root.GetLordLady]," he stammers out. "People on the street are doubting your filial piety. Perhaps you should emulate the ancients and live in a shack by your ancestors' graves to show your devotion?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5727;Sure, I will make the preparations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5727;Live in a what? Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5728;I see my servants whispering to each other whenever I order my meal to be served up. Although I have reduced the opulence of my meals, it seems that they think the reductions I have made are insufficient and only for show. Perhaps I should do something to rectify that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5728;I will eat even less from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5728;Why do I even bother with the diet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5729;As expected of a mourning child, I wear white clothes made of hemp. However, I find it uncomfortable compared to my normal silks and finery. Perhaps a little lapse from mourning traditions would be welcome here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5729;No one will care about a small slip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5729;My clothes show my filial piety!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5730;Due to my grief I have neglected caring for my appearance. My hair is dishevelled and those around me have begun to gossip that I might be too absorbed in my grief to care for myself properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5730;I will fix my hair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5730;It would be improper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5731;It is customary to mourn the dead with offerings of incense and paper money, as well as cleaning up their grave site. I could spend some money on offerings for my recently deceased ancestor, and it would be the pious thing to do, but then again, money is money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5731;I will buy incense to burn before their now-cleaned graves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5731;That sounds like a waste of money and time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5732;Some say that the dead never truly leave us, and that the living can commune with them if the correct rites and rituals are used. While this is dismissed by orthodox scholars as nothing but fanciful superstition, after the loss of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] I am much more tempted to believe in such things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5732;It is worth investigating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5732;I am no fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5733;After weeks of dedicated study, I have finally mastered the ritual. At my command, the spirit of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] appears before me. It is just like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHe] is alive again, and we converse for hours until my power is exhausted and [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHe] has to depart once more. It is like a weight has been lifted from my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5733;Until we meet again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5734;After weeks of dedicated study, I am forced to conclude that my research has reached a dead end. None of the rituals I attempt come close to bringing me to a reunion with [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName], and perhaps no such ritual exists at all. Will I truly never see [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim] again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5734;I have learnt much about the occult, at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5735;After the death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName], I find myself drifting around, bereft of all motivation. Grief is at least something that I can understand, but this crushing emptiness is beyond grief, sapping all of my drive and desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5735;Is there truly nothing left for me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5736;While the days of mourning are a time of grief, for me, they have also proven to be a welcome respite from the struggles of everyday life. The requirement of abstinence from almost all other actions has given me time to relax and let out some of my pent-up stress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5736;A time for relaxation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5737;While the days of mourning have allowed me to relax and relief myself of some stress, it has also caused me to regard my work with less importance. After all, it feels so much better not diligently hammering away at every detail on those official papers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5737;Diligence is overrated anyways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5737;No! I must not allow myself to become lazy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5738;While I have chosen to follow a different faith from [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName], [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] blood still flows through my veins. Perhaps I should try to understand [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] faith, and thus [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim], a little better?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5738;It is part of my heritage, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5738;I must not lose sight of my own faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5739;I am a high-ranking official, and I should certainly have the resources to dedicate a large offering of food and wealth to the spirit of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName]. However, while pious, such large offerings are seen as arrogant and unbecoming of a mourning child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5739;Go ahead with the offering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5739;No, it would just be a show of pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5740;[also_mourning_relative.GetBestName], is also in mourning. Having just lost a close  relative, I can understand [also_mourning_relative.GetHerHis] pain. Perhaps I should approach [also_mourning_relative.GetHerHim] and offer my sympathies? It could be an opportunity to improve our relationship by sharing our grief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5740;I will write [also_mourning_relative.GetHerHim] a letter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5740;I won't want to bother [also_mourning_relative.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5741;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetBestName], has just written me a letter consoling me on my recent loss. This could certainly be an opportunity to strengthen our relationship, but at the same time [From.GetSheHe] is remarkably forward and [From.GetHerHis] letter could be represented as an attempt to rub salt into my wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5741;I will reciprocate [From.GetHerHis] kindness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5741;I will rebuff [From.GetHerHis] attempts at commiseration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5742;I have received a positive response from [From.GetBestName]. It seems that my sympathies were received and appreciated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5742;As a fellow mourner, [From.GetSheHe] knows my pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5743;I have received a strongly worded response from [From.GetBestName], informing me that [From.GetSheHe] has no wish to speak with me. [From.GetSheHeCap] tells me in no uncertain terms to mind my own business and leave [From.GetHerHim] to [From.GetHerHis] grief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5743;I just wanted to help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5745;In recent days, I have found myself more and more paralysed by the thought of death. The death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] has reminded me that no one is immortal, and it seems that fear of my own death has finally caught up with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5745;Anyone could be plotting to kill me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5745;I must accept this looming inevitability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5745;I will face my fears head-on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5746;In recent days, I have found myself thinking about death. The death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] has reminded me that no one has unlimited time, and I must strive to accomplish something soon before my death if I wish to be remembered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5746;I will redouble my efforts and strive for excellence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5746;My legacy will speak for itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5746;Perhaps it is time to think about curbing my ambition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5747;In recent days, I have found myself becoming more friendly towards others. The death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] has reminded me that we are all merely residing temporarily in this world, and perhaps I should be kinder to my fellow lodgers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5747;I could help others with my wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5747;I should set aside more time for those around me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5747;Kindness is a weakness within myself that I must root out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5748;In recent days, I have found myself humbled by the enormity of death. The death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] has reminded me that status in this world means nothing before mortality, and in the end our fates are subject to greater powers than our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5748;I shall devote myself to the higher powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5748;I must rule justly to be treated justly in turn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5748;Or maybe I am the highest power there is?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5749;In recent days, I have found myself doubting the benevolence of the world more and more. The death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] has reminded me of the cruelty of the world. In this unkind world, I must decide how to adapt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5749;There is truly no such thing as justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5749;I cannot be wrong if there is no right and wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5749;It does not make sense, but I must accept it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5750;In recent days, I have found myself growing even more distant from those around me. The death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] has reminded me of the pain of loss, and I do not wish to subject myself to that ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5750;I will never love again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5750;I must harden my heart and turn away from kindness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_5750;I cannot isolate myself forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5751;I am not coping well with the death of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName]. While I tried to hold myself together at first, I found myself growing ever more irritable, snapping at everyone around me. I just couldn't cope with all of it-;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5751;HAHAHA! WHAT A JOKE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5753;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] great virility and eagerness for sexual activity. Although some would say that such inclinations are not to be praised, Confucius does say that the filial son should not deviate from his father's ways...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5753;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5753;Lust is a sin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5754;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] voracious appetite and love of fine foods. While some scholars say that such excesses are to be condemned, [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] eating habits did keep [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim] well-fed and healthy. Perhaps I should seek to emulate [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] appetite?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5754;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5754;Gluttony is a sin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5755;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] great love for money, in particular [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] great love for hoarding money and never spending it. It certainly cannot be denied that [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHe] died a wealthy [ancestor_to_mourn.GetManWoman], and I should certainly emulate [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim] if I wish to do the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5755;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5755;Money only has value when spent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5756;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for caring little for the burdens of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] position, ignoring [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] obligations in favour of a carefree life. While diligence is certainly important, I wonder whether emulating [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] attitude would make me a happier person...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5756;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5756;My role requires my diligence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5757;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for being fast to anger and not letting anyone cross [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim] without consequences. While [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHe] certainly lacked control, no one dared to cross [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim], and perhaps I should emulate [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] behaviour to ensure that I am equally as feared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5757;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5757;I must control my more negative emotions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5758;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] strong envy towards anyone doing better than [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim]. While scholars condemn [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim] for envy, surely wishing to be better than others is a good thing that I should emulate?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5758;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5758;I must not let jealousy consume me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5759;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] pride in [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] accomplishments, often showing off and bragging to others. I myself have had many accomplishments in my life, and perhaps I should emulate [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] pride and confidence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5759;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5759;Despite my accomplishments, I should remain humble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5760;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] distaste for carnal activities. Confucius says that the filial son does not deviate from his father's ways, and scholars agree that I should certainly seek to emulate the chastity of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5760;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5760;Chastity sounds boring...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5761;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] frugal tastes and moderation in food. The scholars speak well of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] actions in curbing the excesses of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] meals, and some have hinted to me that it is something I should emulate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5761;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5761;I do not wish to starve myself for show.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5762;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] great generosity, having spent much of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] own money helping people around [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim]. Perhaps this is an aspect of [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] behaviour that I should seek to emulate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5762;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5762;My money will be used for my own good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5763;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] diligence.

EVTOPTA_SOH_5763;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_5763;I can't be bothered to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_5764;[ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was known for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] patience towards everyone around [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHim]. The scholars say that [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHe] never once lost [ancestor_to_mourn.GetHerHis] temper, and perhaps that is something I should seek to emulate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_5764;I will strive to be more like [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
