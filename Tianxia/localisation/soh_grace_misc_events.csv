EVTDESC_SOH_6414;[Root.GetBestName],\nI write to inform you that the peace deal between our realms is no longer in my interest, and that I will be cancelling it immediately.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[FromFrom.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6414;The Dragon Throne will not forget this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6415;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\nThe [FromFrom.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven has come to the conclusion that the peace deal between your realm and the Middle Kingdom no longer is the will of Heaven, and has thus seen fit to cancel it.\nBy the hand and seal of the [FromFrom.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6415;But we had a deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6419;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\nThe [eoc.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven has come to the conclusion that your faithful service to the Dragon Throne should be rewarded and has seen fit to bestow a substantial amount of Grace on you.\nBy the hand and seal of the [eoc.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [eoc.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6419;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_6422;A Border Adjustment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6422;An emissary has arrived from the [eoc.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, [eoc.GetBestName], requesting the immediate transfer of all land within [border_adjustment_duchy.GetName] to the Middle Kingdom.\nThe emissary cites the many historical precedents for the territory in question being under the control of the Dragon Throne, and warns that refusal would be most unwise as the [eoc.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's displeasure is not to be taken lightly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6422;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6422;Absolutely not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6423;[Root.GetBestName],\nI write to inform you that all land within [border_adjustment_duchy.GetName] immediately will be transferred to the Dragon Throne, seeing as it has been part of the Middle Kingdom in the past.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6423;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6424;[Root.GetBestName],\nI write to inform you that the I will not be transferring any land within [border_adjustment_duchy.GetName] to the Dragon Throne, seeing as it is rightfully part of my realm.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6424;The Dragon Throne will not forget this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_6427;Closer ties to the Dragon Throne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6427;An emissary has arrived from the [eoc.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, [eoc.GetBestName], offering me the honor of tying myself more closely to the Dragon Throne.\nThe emissary makes it clear that this will come with certain expectations and requirements, and warns that refusal would be most unwise as the [eoc.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's displeasure is not to be taken lightly, and that the [eoc.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven might consider the use of force if I refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6427;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6427;I think [eoc.GetSheHe] will reconsider!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_6427;Do your worst!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6428;[Root.GetBestName],\nI write to inform you that I have agreed to closer ties between my realm and the Dragon Throne, as requested.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6428;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6429;[Root.GetBestName],\nSeeing as the Dragon Throne owes me some concessions due to the tributes that have been sent in the past, I think you will agree to reconsider your request.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6429;Very well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6430;[Root.GetBestName],\nI have no intentions of tying myself or my realm any more closely to the Middle Kingdom, and I doubt the Dragon Throne will find much success in compelling me by force of arms.\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6430;We'll see about that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6430;I cannot afford to fight [From.GetBestName] at this time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6431;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\nThe [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven has come to the conclusion that war would not be in the interest of the Middle Kingdom, though [From.GetSheHe] still is most displeased with your defiance.\nBy the hand and seal of the [From.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6431;How cowardly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_6432;The Dragon Defied;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6432;The [eoc.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, [eoc.GetBestName], has failed to compel [defiant_tributary.GetBestName] to tie [defiant_tributary.GetHerHis] realm more closely to the Middle Kingdom, which is a clear sign of weakness.\nPerhaps this weakness is temporary, but it is also very possible that the Dragon Throne is in no position to protect its tributaries. [eoc.GetBestName] is certainly in no position to keep me from distancing my realm from the Middle Kingdom at this time, if that is my desire...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6432;The current state of affairs is fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_6432;I must distance myself from the Dragon Throne...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6433;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\nDespite there being those that would say that I should take this opportunity to distance myself from the Dragon Throne I have chosen to keep all current agreements in place.\nBy the hand and seal of the [From.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6433;As is only right and proper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_6434;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\nConsidering the current state of affairs I have come to the conclusion that it is time for me to distance myself from the Dragon Throne.\nBy the hand and seal of the [From.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_6434;This will not be forgotten!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
