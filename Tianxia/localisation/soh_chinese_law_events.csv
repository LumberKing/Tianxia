EVTDESC_SOH_4507_A;[From.GetBestName], one of the more influential eunuchs at court, has submitted a petition requesting further authority for him and his fellow eunuchs, claiming that this would be in the interests of the realm as they are not easily swayed by dynastic interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4507_B;One of the more influential eunuchs at court, has submitted a petition requesting further authority for him and his fellow eunuchs, claiming that this would be in the interests of the realm as they are not easily swayed by dynastic interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4507;A most sensible proposal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4507;I can give you command of a regiment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4507;How about I just owe you a Favor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4507;Do me a favor and forget this matter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_4507;How about I fire [councillor_to_fire.GetBestName] instead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_4507;I will get back to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_SOH_4507;I think this gold will make you reconsider...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTH_SOH_4507;Perhaps I can convince you otherwise?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTI_SOH_4507;Do you really think this is wise?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTJ_SOH_4507;Absolutely not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4508;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] has decided to fire me. Apparently, one of the eunuchs insisted that the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven should grant certain concessions to him, and [From.GetSheHe] decided to fire me rather than dealing with the matter in some more appropriate manner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4508;I will remember this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4509;I take some time to explain just how unreasonable the eunuch's proposal looks from my perspective and how it would potentially anger others in the realm. To my surprise, my words seem to actually convince the eunuch, as he offers to withdraw the petition immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4509;That actually worked?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4511_A;[From.GetBestName] listens to my expanation, his expression unreadable as I speak. Once I finish, he tells me that my words only have made it clearer that the realm would benefit from him and his fellow eunuchs being in a position to make more decisions without my direct involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4511_B; The eunuch listens to my expanation, his expression unreadable as I speak.

EVTOPTA_SOH_4511;Fine, have it your way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4511;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4512;I tell the eunuch that perhaps angering the [Root.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven is not a wise course of action, and that wasting someone's time with a petition like this easily could anger them. After a moment, the eunuch offers to withdraw the petition, stating that he has reconsidered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4512;That actually worked?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4514_A;[From.GetBestName] does not seem at all impressed by the veiled threats I make about the danger of incurring the displeasure of the [Root.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven. Once I stop speaking, he tells me that my words make it clear that the realm would be better off if he and his fellow eunuchs made more decisions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_4514;Fine, have it your way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4514;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4516;I half expected one of the eunuchs to cause some kind of disturbance following their petition being refused, but nothing of the sort has happened. Indeed, it almost seems as if they have forgotten about the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4516;Fine by me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4517;It seems [chosen_eunuch.GetBestName] has not managed to get over the matter of me refusing to grant his petition, seeing as he has been overheard complaining about it several times. So far, he still seems to be carrying out his tasks appropriately aside from the grumbling, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4517;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4518;It is clear to everyone that [chosen_eunuch.GetBestName] has taken my refusal to grant his petition very personally, as he has been acting in a manner just shy of being punishable by imprisonment or execution. I suspect he will need to be watched carefully from now on...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4518;Will someone rid me of this turbulent eunuch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4519;There was a time when I would have been considered [chosen_eunuch.GetBestName]'s friend, but it is clear that he no longer feels that is true. Most likely, my refusal to grant his petition is to blame, even though I had a good reason to do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4519;Some "friend"!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4520;[chosen_eunuch.GetBestName] has been avoiding me lately, and today he bluntly told me that he no longer feels he honestly can say that he loves me. I did not need to ask why that was the case, as this all started after I rejected his petition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4520;He clearly never loved me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4521;Not only did I manage to upset the eunuch whose petition I refused, but it seems as if all of the eunuchs in the palace are displeased with me. Clearly, regardless of whether they can agree about other things or not they can agree about wanting more power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4521;I should be careful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_4536;You? No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4537;It seems the eunuch that approached me with the petition seems intent to make me regret not granting his wish, seeing as I have learned that he seems to have been involved in the crafting of several orders that clearly are meant to make me look like a fool. Even worse, there is not enough evidence to act on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4537;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4538;I have received word from several provincial governors that they have received supposedly official edicts worded in an insulting fashion, clearly meant to harm their opinion of me. Though it is impossible to say for certain, the wording some parts of the edicts seems quite similar to the wording of the petition I received a while back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4538;Curse that eunuch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4539;I have just received an official-looking edict supposedly written in the name of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven. The edict is written in a highly irregular manner, reading as if it was meant as an insult, and though I suspect a forgery at first it clearly bears the official seal of [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4539;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4540;There have been times when my authority as Grand Chancellor has been insufficient to ensure that matters could be resolved in a manner I felt would truly benefit the realm. Perhaps I should submit a petition to [Root.Liege.GetBestName] to request further authority?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4540;I'm sure the [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven will approve it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4540;Actually, I don't need more influence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4541;[From.GetBestName], my Grand Chancellor, has submitted a petition asking for further authority to be granted to [From.GetHerHim]. It is possible [From.GetSheHe] only seeks personal power, but it is also possible an influential Grand Chancellor could be of assistance at times, so it is not entirely clear whether I should approve this petition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4541;I think this is a brilliant idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4541;I will grant [From.GetHerHim] some Grace instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTK_SOH_4541;I think a few veiled threats will make [From.GetHerHim] reconsider...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTL_SOH_4541;Petition denied!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4542;The [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven has seen fit to grant me the increased authority I requested as Grand Chancellor. This will make it easier for me to do what is required for the realm to prosper... whether under [From.GetBestName]'s rule or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4542;Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4543;The petition I submitted to the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven has been denied, but it seems [From.GetBestName] feels that I am owed something for my loyal service to the realm as the refusal came alongside a decree promising that I am owed a substantial reward from the Dragon Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4543;I suppose that's also beneficial...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4544;Though the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven did not see fit to grant my petition for increased authority [From.GetBestName] clearly thinks I am owed something for my service, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] instead has seen fit to arrange for me to marry [bride_to_be.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4544;I certainly can't refuse this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_4546;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] is unable to grant my petition for increased authority. However, [From.GetSheHe] seems to regret being unable to grant me something for my loyal service, as [From.GetSheHe] has promised me a future Favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4546;This is perhaps more useful in the short term...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4547;I have received word from the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven that [From.GetSheHe] would prefer for me to withdraw my petition. [From.GetBestName]'s response makes it very clear that this is what [From.GetSheHe] wants as repayment for the Favor I owe [From.GetHerHim], and as I had promised a repayment of [From.GetHerHis] choice I must accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4547;If only I could alter the deal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4548;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has seen fit to fire me due to [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s dislike of me.

EVTOPTA_SOH_4548;I will remember this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4549;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, feels it is not the right time to grant me increased authority. However, [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to fire [councillor_to_fire.GetBestName], whose agenda at court often has been contrary to my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4549;I can work with this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4550;I have been informed that the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven is unable to grant my petition at this time, but that [From.GetSheHe] feels that I am owed something for my loyal service.

EVTOPTA_SOH_4550;I suppose this will do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4551;I have been informed that the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven will look into the matter of my petition when the time is right. [From.GetBestName]'s reply made it very clear that [From.GetSheHe] will contact me about the matter, and that I should avoid contacting [From.GetHerHim] about it until further notice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4551;Well, I tried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4552;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has sent me a missive informing me of several reasons [From.GetSheHe] can see not to grant my petition at this time, and has asked me to withdraw it. [From.GetHerHisCap] reasoning was actually quite good, and it would be unwise not to grant [From.GetHerHis] request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4552;[From.GetSheHeCap] made some very good points!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4553;I sent a missive to [From.GetBestName] asking [From.GetHerHim] to withdraw [From.GetHerHis] petition for increased authority as Grand Chancellor, offering a few reasons that perhaps were a bit flimsy. However, it seems [From.GetBestName] was convinced by the missive, as the petition has been withdrawn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4553;I am surprised that worked...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4554;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has sent me a missive informing me of several reasons [From.GetSheHe] can see not to grant my petition at this time, and has asked me to withdraw it. However, while it is possible that [From.GetSheHe] is sincere, [From.GetHerHis] reasoning is indisputably flawed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4554;Was that supposed to convince me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4555;I sent a missive to [From.GetBestName] asking [From.GetHerHim] to withdraw [From.GetHerHis] petition for increased authority as Grand Chancellor, offering a few reasons that perhaps were a bit flimsy.

EVTOPTA_SOH_4555;Fine! Petition granted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4555;In that case, I must refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4556;I was summoned to meet with the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven to discuss my petition today.

The implications were quite clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4556;I should not anger the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4557;I summoned [From.GetBestName] to inform [From.GetHerHim] that [From.GetHerHis] petition potentially could be interpreted as treasonous. It did not surprise me when [From.GetSheHe] immediately informed me that [From.GetSheHe] would withdraw the petition in order to prove that [From.GetSheHe] is a loyal subject of the [Root.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4557;Just as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4558;I was summoned to meet with the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven to discuss my petition today.

EVTOPTA_SOH_4559;I suppose I must grant the petition...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4559;Even so, I will not grant your petition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4561;The [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven has seen fit to refuse my petition. To be perfectly honest, I never really thought it would be accepted, so this is not much of a surprise, even if it would have been nice if it had been accepted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4561;Well, I tried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4562;[From.GetBestName] seems to have taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] petition quite well, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] does not seem to even have complained about the matter in private.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4562;I suppose that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4563;The [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven has seen fit to refuse my petition, even though it clearly would have been good for the realm as a whole if [From.GetSheHe] had accepted it. I have been a loyal Grand Chancellor, and I should receive better treatment than this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4563;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4564;[From.GetBestName] has not taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] petition well, and has been complaining about it both in public and in private. It seems [From.GetSheHe] thinks that [From.GetHerHis] service has been exemplary, and that [From.GetSheHe] is entitled to certain benefits as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4564;I am not surprised...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4565;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has not seen fit to grant my most reasonable petition. I suppose it is possible that [From.GetSheHe] did not refuse this out of personal enmity, but in a way it feels personal, and maybe I should not forgive this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4565;[From.GetSheHeCap] has made an enemy this day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4565;I wouldn't go that far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4566;It seems [From.GetBestName] has taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] petition very personally, as [From.GetSheHe] has been overheard claiming that it is clear that I do not respect [From.GetHerHim] and that [From.GetSheHe] feels that I wish for [From.GetHerHim] to be an enemy... and that [From.GetSheHe] is feels the same way about me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4566;This could be a problem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4567;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has not seen fit to grant my most reasonable petition. I would have thought that [From.GetSheHe] would have seen fit to grant me further authority, seeing as we are friends, but apparently [From.GetSheHe] does not consider that sufficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4567;[From.GetSheHeCap] is no friend of mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4567;I wouldn't go that far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4568;It seems [From.GetBestName] has taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] petition very personally, as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] no longer considers me [From.GetHerHis] friend. I had thought that our friendship would have been sufficient to make [From.GetHerHim] accept my refusal gracefully, but apparently it was not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4568;Some "friend"...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4569;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has not seen fit to grant my most reasonable petition. I would have thought that [From.GetSheHe] would have seen fit to grant me further authority, seeing as we are lovers, but apparently [From.GetSheHe] does not consider that sufficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4569;[From.GetSheHeCap] clearly does not love me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4569;I wouldn't go that far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4570;It seems [From.GetBestName] has taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] petition very personally, as [From.GetSheHe] has made it very clear that [From.GetSheHe] thinks I no longer love [From.GetHerHim], and that [From.GetSheHe] definitely feels the same way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4570;[From.GetSheHeCap] clearly never loved me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4571;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, refused to grant my petition despite my loyal service as Grand Chancellor. Perhaps I should let everyone in the realm know that [From.GetSheHe] does not reward loyalty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4571;It is only fair...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4571;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4572;I have learned that [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to send forth messages informing the realm of my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] supposedly reasonable petition. Doubtlessly, [From.GetSheHe] has framed those messages in a way that makes my refusal seem anything but reasonable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4572;This is not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4573;I have received a letter from [FromFrom.GetBestName], the Grand Chancellor of [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven. Apparently, [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to refuse a petition to ever so slightly increase [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s authority, despite [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s most faithful service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4573;How ungrateful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4574;My very reasonable petition has been refused by the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, despite me being a most faithful Grand Chancellor. I could very easily make [From.GetBestName] regret this by altering the wording of some official decrees to make [From.GetHerHim] come across in an unflattering way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4574;[From.GetSheHeCap] deserves no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4574;I can't do this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4575;It seems [From.GetBestName] might not have taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] petition well, as several official decrees [From.GetSheHe] has overseen have been sent out worded in a fashion that makes me come across in a rather unflattering way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4575;Curse [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4576;My petition was refused by [From.GetBestName] with no sensible justification. I think payback might be in order, and as I know [possible_gc_lover.GetBestName] is not particularly close to [From.GetBestName] perhaps convincing [possible_gc_lover.GetHerHim] to sleep with me would be suitable payback?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4576;I will proposition [possible_gc_lover.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4576;It would be wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4577;[From.GetBestName] seems to have taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] petition quite well, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] does not seem to even have complained about the matter in private.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4577;I suppose that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4578;One day I am approached by [From.GetBestName], the Grand Chancellor. [From.GetSheHeCap] has our respective attendants dismissed so that we may speak in private, and then suggests that perhaps we should retire somewhere private to get to know each other intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4578;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4578;Absolutely not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4579;[From.GetBestName] was quite receptive to my suggestion, and between [From.GetHerHis] influence and mine it was trivial to ensure that we would not be disturbed while we got to know each other much more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4579;I look forward to doing this again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4579;This was a one-time thing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4580;After a while in [From.GetBestName]'s company the two of us need to part ways to deal with our respective duties. [From.GetBestName] makes it clear that [From.GetSheHe] would be open to further intimate encounters, particularly with [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName] not treating either of us well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4580;That sounds wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4581;After a while in [From.GetBestName]'s company the two of us need to part ways to deal with our respective duties. [From.GetBestName] makes it clear that while [From.GetSheHe] enjoyed my company [From.GetSheHe] thinks it would be wise for us to not make a habit out of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4581;Perhaps that is for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4582;I arranged for [From.GetBestName]'s attendants and mine to be dismissed so that we could speak in private, and made my proposition. However, [From.GetSheHe] was most unreceptive, and summoned [From.GetHerHis] attendants to [From.GetHerHis] side immediately so that [From.GetSheHe] could depart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4582;What a prudish [From.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4584;Today I was approached by [From.GetBestName] with a request to grant further authority to [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetHerHis] fellow courtiers. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] feels that the current state of affairs benefits other groups, such as the eunuchs and my vassals, far too much, and both of those groups could of course be a problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4584;I think that's an excellent idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4584;I'll make you my primary spouse instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4584;I will make you my spouse instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4584;I will increase your consort rank instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_4584;I will arrange an Imperial Marriage instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_4584;I will grant you a Favor instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_SOH_4584;You owe me a Favor, so forget about this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTH_SOH_4584;I will fire someone you dislike instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTI_SOH_4584;I think I can deflect this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTJ_SOH_4584;I will give you a "gift" instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTK_SOH_4584;I can refuse this diplomatically...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTL_SOH_4584;Perhaps a threat will work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTM_SOH_4584;This is not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4585;I have just received word that I have been fired from the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven's council. Apparently, [From.GetBestName] was approached by [FromFrom.GetBestName] about a petition [From.GetSheHe] did not wish to grant, and firing me seemed like a suitable alternative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4585;Curse them both!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4586;I spend some time explaining to [FromFrom.GetBestName] why granting [FromFrom.GetHerHis] petition would be a bad idea, and how the realm would benefit more from me not granting it. To my surprise, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] immediately offers to withdraw it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4586;That... worked?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4587;[From.GetBestName] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] does not think that granting my petition would be a good idea, suggesting that it would go against the interests of the realm. However, [From.GetHerHis] arguments were flimsy at best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4587;I will ask again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4588;It seems I was unable to convince [From.GetBestName] that [From.GetSheHe] should withdraw [From.GetHerHis] petition for the good of the realm, as [From.GetSheHe] repeated [From.GetHerHis] request after I had presented my best arguments against it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4588;Fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4588;Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4589;I make sure that [FromFrom.GetBestName] knows that [FromFrom.GetHerHis] petition is something that an less generous person might interpret as treasonous, suggesting that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] should withdraw it. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] immediately does this when I finish speaking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4589;As I expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4590;[From.GetBestName] apparently thinks that a less generous person might interpret my petition as somewhat treasonous, and suggests that perhaps I wish to withdraw it, but I doubt [From.GetSheHe] really is seriously implying that [From.GetSheHe] does not like it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4590;I will ask again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4591;It seems my veiled threats went over [From.GetBestName]'s head, or were unconvincing if they were understood, seeing as [From.GetBestName] repeated [From.GetHerHis] request almost as soon as I finished making the threat. I guess I must be direct if I wish to refuse the petition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4591;Fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4591;Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4593;I half expected one of the courtiers to cause some kind of disturbance following [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s petition being refused, but nothing of the sort has happened. Indeed, it almost seems as if they have forgotten about the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4593;Fine by me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4594;It seems [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] has not managed to get over the matter of me refusing to grant [FromFromFrom.GetHerHis] petition, seeing as [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] has been overheard complaining about it several times. So far, [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] seems content with grumbling, however..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4594;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4595;It is clear to everyone that [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] has taken my refusal to grant [FromFromFrom.GetHerHis] petition very personally, as [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] has been acting in a manner just shy of being punishable by imprisonment or execution. I suspect [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] will need to be watched carefully from now on...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4595;This could be a problem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4596;There was a time when I would have been considered [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s friend, but it is clear that [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] no longer feels that is true. Most likely, my refusal to grant [FromFromFrom.GetHerHis] petition is to blame, even though I had a good reason to do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4596;Some "friend"!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4597;[FromFromFrom.GetBestName] has been avoiding me lately, and today [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] bluntly told me that [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] no longer feels [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] honestly can say that [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] loves me. I did not need to ask why that was the case, as this all started after I rejected [FromFromFrom.GetHerHis] petition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4597;[FromFromFrom.GetSheHeCap] clearly never loved me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4598;It seems nearly every [FromFromFrom.GetManWoman] in my life is upset with me these days, as my refusal to grant [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s petition apparently is something they all feel is most unreasonable, even though they often disagree about other things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4598;I should be careful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4599;[From.GetBestName]'s refusal to grant my petition was quite unjustifiable. I feel like I should try to get back at him. Perhaps seducing one of [From.GetHerHis] councillors would be just the thing? I suspect [possible_courtier_lover.GetBestName] might be interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4599;I will approach [possible_courtier_lover.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4599;I think that's going too far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4600;Today I was approached by [From.GetBestName], who asked to speak to me privately. I granted the request, and [From.GetSheHe] brought up the matter of a recent disagreement [From.GetSheHe] had with [FromFrom.GetBestName], suggesting that we could retire to my bedroom to discuss it in detail, among other activities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4600;What a great idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4600;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4601;[From.GetBestName] was receptive to my proposition, and it was easy for us to meet privately in [From.GetHerHis] bedroom to talk, among other things. It was an enjoyable time, and now that it is time to leave I need to decide whether it is something I think we should do again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4601;We should do this again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4601;This was a one-time thing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4602;[From.GetBestName] and I had a very enjoyable time together, and as [From.GetSheHe] was about to leave [From.GetSheHe] told me that [From.GetSheHe] hopes that we will be able to meet privately for further "discussions".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4602;I look forward to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4603;[From.GetBestName] and I had a very enjoyable time together. However, as [From.GetSheHe] was about to leave [From.GetSheHe] informed me that it probably would not be a good idea for us to make a habit out of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4603;Possibly for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4604;[From.GetBestName] was not interested in my proposition, telling me that [From.GetSheHe] feels I should leave [From.GetHerHis] presence in a hurry before [From.GetSheHe] feels the need to tell the [FromFromFrom.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven about what I said.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4604;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4606;As I am about to retire for the night a guard comes running, bringing word that someone has made an attempt to murder one of my children, specifically [From.GetBestName]. The attempt was unsuccessful, but the would-be murderer is still on the loose, and is suspected to be someone that easily could gain access to [From.GetBestName]'s quarters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4606;[chosen_courtier.GetBestName], perhaps?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4607;As I am about to retire for the night a guard comes running, bringing word that an attempt has been made on the life of my [From.GetSonDaughter] [From.GetBestName]. The attempt was unsuccessful, and the guards have caught the would-be murderer, namely [courtier_murderer.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4607;Off with [chosen_courtier.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4607;Throw [chosen_courtier.GetHerHis] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4608;As I am about to retire for the night a guard comes running, bringing word that my [From.GetSonDaughter] [From.GetBestName] has been found murdered. Despite the guards' best efforts, the killer is still at large, and it seems quite likely that they had easy access to [From.GetBestName]'s quarters and knew [From.GetSheHe] would be there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4608;[chosen_courtier.GetBestName], perhaps?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4609;As I am about to retire for the night a guard comes running, bringing word that my [From.GetSonDaughter] [From.GetBestName] has been murdred. The killer was caught fleeing from the scene, and is apparently none other than [courtier_murderer.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4609;Off with [chosen_courtier.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4609;Throw [chosen_courtier.GetHerHis] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4610;One evening when I have almost fallen asleep I hear the sound of someone moving nearby. Turning towards the sound, I see a shadowed figure standing near my bed.\n\n"You know what this is about," the figure says, raising a dagger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4610;Guards! To me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4611;I manage to fend off the would-be assassin well enough until my guards arrive, and they take no chances when they reach me, cutting down the assassin. Despite thoroughly investigating the body, nothing is discovered tying the dead woman to any specific person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4611;Maybe it was [chosen_courtier.GetBestName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4611;I need to watch them all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4612;I manage to fend off the would-be assassin well enough until my guards arrive, and they take no chances when they reach me, cutting down the assassin. The dead woman apparently thought it was wise to carry her instructions with her, signed by none other than [courtier_murderer.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4612;Guards! I want this [chosen_courtier.GetManWoman] dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4612;Guards! I want this [chosen_courtier.GetManWoman] imprisoned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4613;I do my best to fight off the assassin, but even though the woman was careless enough for me to notice her approach she is far from unskilled, and she soon has fatally wounded me. My vision is already fading by the time that she slips out the window, well before the guards have reached me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4613;Was... [chosen_courtier.GetBestName] behind... this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4614;Who... hired her?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4614;I do my best to fight off the assassin, but she is far from unskilled and fatally wound me with ease. As I collapse to the floor I see her reach the entrance to a hidden passageway, where [courtier_murderer.GetBestName] is holding the door open for her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4614;You? No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4615;It seems [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] seems intent to make me regret not granting [FromFromFrom.GetHerHis] wish, seeing as I have learned that [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] seems to have been involved in the crafting of several orders that clearly are meant to make me look like a fool. Even worse, there is not enough evidence to act on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4615;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4616;I have received word from several provincial governors that they have received supposedly official edicts worded in an insulting fashion, clearly meant to harm their opinion of me. Though it is impossible to say for certain, the wording some parts of the edicts seems quite similar to some things [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] has written in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4616;Curse that [FromFromFrom.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4617;I have just received an official-looking edict supposedly written in the name of the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven. The edict is written in a highly irregular manner, reading as if it was meant as an insult, and though I suspect a forgery at first it clearly bears the official seal of [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4617;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4618;The [Root.Liege.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven currently imposes certain restrictions on me and my fellow vassals, supposedly for the good of the realm. However, I doubt that I am the only one who thinks that there are times when it would be beneficial for the realm if vassals had more rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4618;I should request more authority!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4618;My liege probably knows best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4619;[From.GetBestName], one of my vassals, has requested an audience with me, which I have granted as that felt appropriate. As soon as we were done with the initial pleasantries, [From.GetSheHe] brought up the matter of the current restrictions on my vassals' authority, suggesting that the realm might benefit from them gaining further rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4619;Perhaps I have been overly harsh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4619;I will give [From.GetHerHim] some Grace instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_4619;I will grant him an Imperial Marriage instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_4619;I will grant [husband_to_be.GetBestName] an Imperial Marriage instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_4619;I will grant {From.GetHerHim] a Favor instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_SOH_4619;Time to call in the Favor [From.GetSheHe] owes me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_SOH_4619;I will fire someone [From.GetSheHe] dislikes instead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTH_SOH_4619;I will deflect the issue, in various ways...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTI_SOH_4619;I think [From.GetSheHe] will accept a bribe instead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTJ_SOH_4619;Maybe I can get out of this with diplomacy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTK_SOH_4619;Maybe a threat would be effective?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTL_SOH_4619;Request denied!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4620;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, considers my request carefully for a moment before declaring that [From.GetSheHe] can see giving me and my fellow vassals further authority could help the realm. Before long, messengers have been dispatched to all parts of the realm, bringing word of what has happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4620;Exactly as I predicted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4621;[From.GetBestName] considers my request for a moment before stating that [From.GetSheHe] unfortunately cannot grant it. The [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven does however make it clear that the Dragon Throne owes me something, and states that I might request something else in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4621;I can think of some ways to use this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4622;[From.GetBestName] informs me that [From.GetSheHe] does not think it would be wise to grant my request at this time. [From.GetSheHeCap] does, however, feel that I am owed something by the Dragon Throne, and suggests a marriage to [bride_to_be.GetBestName]. I cannot reasonably refuse this offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4622;This could be most beneficial!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4623;[From.GetBestName] informs me that [From.GetSheHe] does not think it would be wise to grant my request at this time. [From.GetSheHeCap] does, however, feel that I am owed something by the Dragon Throne, and suggests arranging for [husband_to_be.GetBestName] to marry [bride_to_be.GetBestName]. I cannot reasonably refuse this offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4623;This could be most beneficial!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4624;After considering my request for a moment [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, says that [From.GetSheHe] would prefer not to grant it, making it clear that [From.GetSheHe] would owe me a Favor if I agree to withdraw the request. I can see no way to refuse this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4624;I can make good use of a Favor...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4625;I have barely finished making my request before [From.GetBestName] tells me that I am to withdraw it, as [From.GetSheHe] is owed a Favor by me and [From.GetSheHe] wants it to be repaid in this manner. Given that the terms as to what Favor I owed specified that [From.GetBestName] could choose the Favor, it is hard to refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4625;Unthinkable, even...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4626;I have just been informed that [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, apparently has no further need of my services. I suspect that this is due to some request that [FromFrom.GetBestName] made, though it is also possible that [FromFrom.GetSheHe asked for something else and my firing was a compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4626;Curse both their names!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4627;After listening to my request [From.GetBestName] asks for a moment to think about it. A short while later, the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven tells me that [From.GetSheHe] cannot grant my request, but that [From.GetSheHe] feels that [From.GetSheHe] could fire [councillor_to_fire.GetBestName] if it would please me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4627;That would be appreciated, yes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4628;[From.GetBestName] asks for some time to think on my request, and I retire to the quarters I have been granted at [From.GetHerHis] palace. A short while later, several servants arrive, carrying with them a substantial amount of money from the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, who regrets that [From.GetSheHe] cannot grant my request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4628;I can live with this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4629;[From.GetBestName] informs me that [From.GetSheHe] will consider the merits of my request, and that [From.GetSheHe] will get back to me when [From.GetSheHe] wishes to discuss it further. The [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven suggests I do not bring up the request again until this time. [From.GetSheHeCap] will send for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4629;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4630;After listening to my request the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven tells me that it is an interesting request but that it might be a good idea for me to withdraw it, providing me with several reasons why it might not be good for either me or the realm if it was granted. [From.GetSheHeCap] was quite convincing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4630;[From.GetSheHeCap] made some very good points!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4631;I do my best to come up with reasons as to why granting [From.GetBestName]'s request would not be a good idea, trying to avoid making it sound as if I am just saying it because it would be bad for me. When I have finished, [From.GetSheHe] immediately withdraws the request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4631;That actually worked?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4632;After listening to my request the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven tells me that it is an interesting request but that it might be a good idea for me to withdraw it, providing me with several reasons why it might not be good for either me or the realm if it was granted. [From.GetSheHeCap] was not remotely convincing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4632;I will ask again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4633;I do my best to come up with reasons as to why granting [From.GetBestName]'s request would not be a good idea, trying to avoid making it sound as if I am just saying it because it would be bad for me. When I have finished, [From.GetSheHe] repeats the request, clearly unconvinced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4633;Have it your way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4633;I will not grant your request!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4634;Having listened to my request, [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven suggests that it would displease [From.GetHerHim] greatly to hear that any vassal of [From.GetHerHis] insisted on making unreasonable requests. The implications were quite clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4634;[From.GetHerHisCap] anger would be terrible to behold...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4635;I told [From.GetBestName] that I do not wish to be bothered with unreasonable requests and that anyone approaching me with such requests risks my displeasure. [From.GetSheHeCap] clearly got the message, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] quickly decided to withdraw [From.GetHerHis] request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4635;That actually worked?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4636;Having listened to my request, [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven suggests that it would displease [From.GetHerHim] greatly to hear that any vassal of [From.GetHerHis] insisted on making unreasonable requests. Obviously, [From.GetSheHe] meant petitions by other vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4636;I will make my request again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4637;I told [From.GetBestName] that I do not wish to be bothered with unreasonable requests and that anyone approaching me with such requests risks my displeasure. I am uncertain whether the implications were unclear or whether [From.GetBestName] simply did not understand them, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] immediately repeated the initial request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4637;I suppose I can agree to it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4637;I will not grant your request!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4639;The [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven has seen fit to refuse my request. To be perfectly honest, I never really thought it would be accepted, so this is not much of a surprise, even if it would have been nice if it had been accepted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4639;Well, I tried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4640;[From.GetBestName] seems to have taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] request quite well, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] does not seem to even have complained about the matter in private.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4640;I suppose that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4641;The [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven has seen fit to refuse my request, even though it clearly would have been good for the realm as a whole if [From.GetSheHe] had accepted it. I have been a loyal subject, and I should receive better treatment than this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4641;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4642;[From.GetBestName] has not taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] request well, and has been complaining about it both in public and in private. It seems [From.GetSheHe] thinks that [From.GetHerHis] service has been exemplary, and that [From.GetSheHe] is entitled to certain benefits as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4642;I am not surprised...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4643;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has not seen fit to grant my most reasonable request. I suppose it is possible that [From.GetSheHe] did not refuse this out of personal enmity, but in a way it feels personal, and maybe I should not forgive this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4643;[From.GetSheHeCap] has made an enemy this day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4643;I wouldn't go that far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4644;It seems [From.GetBestName] has taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] request very personally, as [From.GetSheHe] has been overheard claiming that it is clear that I do not respect [From.GetHerHim] and that [From.GetSheHe] feels that I wish for [From.GetHerHim] to be an enemy... and that [From.GetSheHe] is feels the same way about me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4644;This could be a problem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4645;[From.GetBestName], the  [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has not seen fit to grant my most reasonable request. I would have thought that [From.GetSheHe] would have seen fit to grant this simple request, seeing as we are friends, but apparently [From.GetSheHe] does not consider that sufficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4645;[From.GetSheHeCap] is no friend of mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4645;I wouldn't go that far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4646;It seems [From.GetBestName] has taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] request very personally, as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] no longer considers me [From.GetHerHis] friend. I had thought that our friendship would have been sufficient to make [From.GetHerHim] accept my refusal gracefully, but apparently it was not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4646;Some "friend"...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4647;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has not seen fit to grant my most reasonable request. I would have thought that [From.GetSheHe] would have seen fit to grant it, seeing as we are lovers, but apparently [From.GetSheHe] does not consider that sufficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4647;[From.GetSheHeCap] clearly does not love me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4647;I wouldn't go that far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4648;It seems [From.GetBestName] has taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] request very personally, as [From.GetSheHe] has made it very clear that [From.GetSheHe] thinks I no longer love [From.GetHerHim], and that [From.GetSheHe] definitely feels the same way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4648;[From.GetSheHeCap] clearly never loved me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4649;[From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, refused to grant my request despite it being very much in the interest of the realm. Perhaps I should let everyone in the realm know that [From.GetSheHe] acts in a manner that is almost tyrannical?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4649;It is only fair...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4649;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4650;I have learned that [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to send forth messages informing the realm of my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] supposedly reasonable request. Doubtlessly, [From.GetSheHe] has framed those messages in a way that makes my refusal seem anything but reasonable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4650;This is not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4651;I have received a letter from [FromFrom.GetBestName] that the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven is acting in a manner that is almost tyrannical. Apparently, [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to refuse a request to ever so slightly increase the rights of [From.GetHerHis] vassals, despite [FromFrom.GetBestName] requesting only minor concessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4651;It was clearly a reasonable request!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4652;My very reasonable request has been refused by the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, despite me being a most faithful subject. I could very easily make [From.GetBestName] regret this by insisting that court protocols be followed to the letter, even if cases where [From.GetBestName] would benefit from that not being the case...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4652;[From.GetSheHeCap] deserves no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_4652;I can't do this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4653;It seems [From.GetBestName] might not have taken my refusal to grant [From.GetHerHis] request well, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] seems to have taken steps to ensure that every single court protocol is followed to the letter, even in situations where doing so would be embarrassing or inconvenient for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4653;Curse [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4654;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has been convinced to grant further authority to the eunuchs at court. What this will mean for the realm is uncertain, but it certainly does not benefit me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4654;Eunuchs given more power? Worrying...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4655;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has been convinced to grant further authority to the Grand Chancellor, [FromFrom.GetBestName]. Just how the Grand Chancellor will use this authority still remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4655;Being the Grand Chancellor must be nice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4656;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has been convinced to grant further authority to various court bureaucrats and other influential courtiers. What this will mean for the realm is uncertain, but it certainly does not benefit me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4656;This might be trouble...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_4657;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName], the [From.GetSonDaughterCap] of Heaven, has been convinced to grant further authority to me and my fellow vassals. Whether this is what is best for the realm is unclear, but it certainly will benefit me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_4657;What excellent news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
