EVTOPTC_JDEXTRA_2062;Buy the artifact;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JDEXTRA_2062;Do not buy the artifact;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2002;Despite travelling far and wide, your agents have had no luck finding someone willing to sell you a Chinese artifact. You will have to find a craftsman willing to create one instead, most likely, unless you have better luck on a second attempt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JDEXTRA_2002;That's unfortunate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2003;Your agents report that they have found a strange man possessing a painting of a mighty steed with unusual hoofs, which almost seem to sparkle. While the man's sanity is questionable, the painting is obviously in the [Root.GetAppropriateChinaAdj] style and could be yours for a small sum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2004;The son of a deceased [Root.GetAppropriateChinaAdj] official has been found by your agents, possessing a small figurine of a former ruler of the Middle Kingdom. Having fallen on hard times, the man is willing to part with the figurine for a small amount of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2005;By pure chance, one of your agents stumbled upon a merchant possessing a book about the recent history of the Middle Kingdom. Hearing that an illustrious [Root.GetManWoman] was interested in buying the book, the merchant offered to sell the book at a discount.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2006;A young woman, supposedly the last surviving member of a long line of officers, has been found by your agents. She possesses a [Root.GetAppropriateChinaAdj] Arm Protector inherited from her father that she is willing to part with in exchange for some gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2007;Your agents have found a minor nobleman deep in debt who posesses a Serpent Spear that he would be willing to part with in exchange for a modest amount of gold so that he can pay off some of the debt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2008;A female merchant of some renown has learned of your search for Chinese artifacts and has approached your agents with an offer to sell them a Tapestry Depicting Trade, no doubt hoping that it will be the first of many things she sells you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2009;One of your agents has discovered a [Root.GetAppropriateChinaAdj] official with a talent for painting who apparently is willing to part with a [Root.GetAppropriateChinaAdj] Artwork for an unusually low price. If you want to buy the artwork, you need to do it now, though, since someone else might buy it otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2010;When passing through the marketplace on an unrelated errand, one of your agents stumbled upon a calligraphist with some impressive [Root.GetAppropriateChinaAdj] Calligraphy. The woman in question, though skilled when it comes to calligraphy, seems to have a bad idea of what it is worth, and your agent got a good offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2011;Your agents have found a merchant possessing a [Root.GetAppropriateChinaAdj] Sculpture that he apparently is eager to sell, and they have received an exceptionally good offer from him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2012;One of your agents, whose search took her far from your court, has returned, bringing word that she has encountered a mercenary captain in possession of a Silk Shroud that supposedly once belonged to a past empress of China. Your agent has managed to secure an offer to sell the artifact to you for a favorable price, should you want it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2013;You had almost given up hope when one of your agents brings an envoy from a minor noblewoman living far from the heart of the Middle Kingdom. The envoy brings with her a [Root.GetAppropriateChinaAdj] Tapestry that her mistress apparently is willing to part with for a small sum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2014;An agent of yours has heard that a mid-ranked [Root.GetAppropriateChinaAdj] officer has a Ji that he is in a hurry to sell, and your agent has received a very generous offer to buy it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2015;A [Root.GetAppropriateChinaAdj] craftsman has contacted one of your agents, offering to sell you a Zhuge Crossbow for a much lower price than most craftsmen would be willing to offer you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2016;Your agents have learned that another noble who also has been hunting for Chinese artifacts has come into possession of two [Root.GetAppropriateChinaAdj] Bronze Sculptures, which is one more than he needs. He has made your agents a generous offer to sell one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2017;A famous tailor has learned of your search for Chinese artifacts and is offering to create some Ceremonial Robes for you at a discount, doubtlessly hoping that this will lead to more business for him in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2018;When visiting a city that recently suffered from an epidemic, your agents encountered a physician of some fame who offered to sell them a [Root.GetAppropriateChinaAdj] Compendium of Medicine for a surprisingly small amount of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2019;A scribe who helped with the legal work following a minor dispute between two noble families has been in contact with your agents, offering to sell them a [Root.GetAppropriateChinaAdj] Treatise on Law for a much lower amount of gold than expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2020;One of your agents came across a merchant possessing a [Root.GetAppropriateChinaAdj] Chronicle of Economic Principle just as the woman was about to leave your capital. She has offered to sell the book at a discount, but as she is in a hurry to leave you need to respond quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2021;Despite having several agents searching for Chinese artifacts, it is one of your bodyguards who brings you the news that there is a trader at the marketplace who is willing to part with a Water Clock for a surprisingly small amount of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2022;A well-known swordsman has approached one of your agents with an offer to sell them a Jian that he no longer needs. Despite the quality of the blade, the man's price is very low.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2023;By pure chance, a messenger in your service came across a minor nobleman in possession of a Dragon Amulet that he appears eager to get rid of. The offer your man was given is quite generous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2024;During a visit to the marketplace you come across a merchant in possession of various trinkets of varied origin. One of those trinkets is a Jade Dragon that the merchant apparently has no idea what it is worth, since he offers to sell it for a very small sum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
