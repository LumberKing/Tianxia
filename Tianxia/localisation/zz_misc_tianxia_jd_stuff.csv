EVTOPTC_JDEXTRA_2062;Buy the artifact;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JDEXTRA_2062;Do not buy the artifact;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2002;Despite travelling far and wide, your agents have had no luck finding someone willing to sell you a [Root.GetChinaShortName] artifact. You will have to find a craftsman willing to create one instead, most likely, unless you have better luck on a second attempt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JDEXTRA_2002;That's unfortunate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2003;Your agents report that they have found a strange man possessing a painting of a mighty steed with unusual hoofs, possibly the legendary Shanguang Tí. While the man's sanity is questionable, the painting is obviously of [Root.GetChinaShortName] origin and could be yours for a small sum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2004;The son of a deceased [Root.GetChinaShortName] official has been found by your agents, possessing a small figurine of a former ruler of the Middle Kingdom. Having fallen on hard times, the man is willing to part with the figurine for a small amount of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2005;By pure chance, one of your agents stumbled upon a merchant possessing a book about the recent history of the Middle Kingdom. Hearing that an illustrious [Root.GetManWoman] was interested in buying the book, the merchant offered to sell the book at a discount.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2006;A young woman, supposedly the last surviving member of a long line of officers, has been found by your agents. She possesses a [Root.GetChinaShortName] Arm Protector inherited from her father that she is willing to part with in exchange for some gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2007;Your agents have found a minor nobleman deep in debt who posesses a Serpent Spear that he would be willing to part with in exchange for a modest amount of gold so that he can pay off some of the debt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2008;A female merchant of some renown has learned of your search for [Root.GetChinaShortName] artifacts and has approached your agents with an offer to sell them a Tapestry Depicting Trade, no doubt hoping that it will be the first of many things she sells you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2009;One of your agents has discovered a [Root.GetChinaShortName] official with a talent for painting who apparently is willing to part with a [Root.GetChinaShortName] Artwork for an unusually low price. If you want to buy the artwork, you need to do it now, though, since someone else might buy it otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2010;When passing through the marketplace on an unrelated errand, one of your agents stumbled upon a calligraphist with some impressive [Root.GetChinaShortName] Calligraphy. The woman in question, though skilled when it comes to calligraphy, seems to have a bad idea of what it is worth, and your agent got a good offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2011;Your agents have found a merchant possessing a [Root.GetChinaShortName] Sculpture that he apparently is eager to sell, and they have received an exceptionally good offer from him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2012;One of your agents, whose search took her far from your court, has returned, bringing word that she has encountered a mercenary captain in possession of a Silk Shroud that once belonged to a past empress of China. Your agent has managed to secure an offer to sell the artifact to you for a favorable price, should you want it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2013;You had almost given up hope when one of your agents brings an envoy from a minor noblewoman living far from the heart of the Middle Kingdom. The envoy brings with her a [Root.GetChinaShortName] Tapestry that her mistress apparently is willing to part with for a small sum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2014;An agent of yours has heard that a mid-ranked [Root.GetChinaShortName] officer has a Ji that he is in a hurry to sell, and your agent has received a very generous offer to buy it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2015;A [Root.GetChinaShortName] craftsman has contacted one of your agents, offering to sell you a Zhuge Crossbow for a much lower price than most craftsmen would be willing to offer you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2016;Your agents have learned that another noble who also has been hunting for [Root.GetChinaShortName] artifacts has come into possession of two [Root.GetChinaShortName] Bronze Sculptures, which is one more than he needs. He has made your agents a generous offer to sell one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2017;A famous tailor has learned of your search for [Root.GetChinaShortName] artifacts and is offering to create some Ceremonial Robes for you at a discount, doubtlessly hoping that this will lead to more business for him in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2018;When visiting a city that recently suffered from an epidemic, your agents encountered a physician of some fame who offered to sell them a [Root.GetChinaShortName] Compendium of Medicine for a surprisingly small amount of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2019;A scribe who helped with the legal work following a minor dispute between two noble families has been in contact with your agents, offering to sell them a [Root.GetChinaShortName] Treatise on Law for a much lower amount of gold than expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2020;One of your agents came across a merchant possessing a [Root.GetChinaShortName] Chronicle of Economic Principle just as the woman was about to leave your capital. She has offered to sell the book at a discount, but as she is in a hurry to leave you need to respond quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2021;Despite having several agents searching for [Root.GetChinaShortName] artifacts, it is one of your bodyguards who brings you the news that there is a trader at the marketplace who is willing to part with a Water Clock for a surprisingly small amount of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2022;A well-known swordsman has approached one of your agents with an offer to sell them a Jian that he no longer needs. Despite the quality of the blade, the man's price is very low.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2023;By pure chance, a messenger in your service came across a minor nobleman in possession of a Dragon Amulet that he appears eager to get rid of. The offer your man was given is quite generous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2024;During a visit to the marketplace you come across a merchant in possession of various trinkets of varied origin. One of those trinkets is a Jade Dragon that the merchant apparently has no idea what it is worth, since he offers to sell it for a very small sum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2025;Sun Tzu wrote the Art of War over a millenia ago, but its wisdom is still valid and your agents have come across an old strategist who is prepared to part with his copy of the book for a modest amount of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2036;You wait patiently for the calligraphist to finish working on your book, but it never arrives. By the time you get around to sending someone to check up on the man, he is nowhere to be found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JDEXTRA_2036;Curse that man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JDEXTRA_2037;You know of several craftsmen in [Root.Capital.GetName] who possess the skills necessary to create various kinds of Chinese artifacts. What kind of artifact do you want?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
