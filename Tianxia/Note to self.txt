- CleanSlate is set as a dependency; currently using 1.0 Beta 6.1 [EZKM].
- Work started from 1.0 Beta 6.1 [EZKM]; later CleanSlate changes need to be incorporated when CleanSlate releases a new version.
- ALWAYS launch the game and run an observer game at least daily when making any significant edits (number or extent); it reduces the number of files to check if there's a new CTD compared to when the cause could be X days back.
