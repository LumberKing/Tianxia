			# - Usurp all vassal khans' provinces and vassals in the China region
			# - Release all vassal khans and make them Imperial Tributaries
			# - Set up opinion modifiers for all vassals
			# - Destroy all titular titles
			# - Get the Confucian Bureaucracy government and fire an event
			# The event does the following for FROM (ROOT in the event)
			# - Activates, flags, and grants e_northern_steppe
			# - Re-vassalizes people
			# - Makes all non-nomadic tributaries located in China that aren't empires into vassals, and make the rest into Imperial Tributaries
			# - Usurps/create capital duchy and possibly kingdom
			# - Makes FROM Chinese Imperial, removes all Grace, penalizes Grace, and fires the naming event
