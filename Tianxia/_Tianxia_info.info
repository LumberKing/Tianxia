General guidelines moving forward:
- modifier for ai_chance/ai_will_do blocks -> mult_modifier.
- modifier = { factor = 0 <condition> } blocks should be replaced with a shared trigger = { <inverse condition }.
- When adding a TODO note, make it "TIANXIATODO"; this makes it possible to avoid false positives when searching for the TODOs.
- Performance test new stuff in a fairly frequent manner (e.g. after setting up a new event chain) for a decent number of years in observer mode; this makes it easier to determine what causes issues.
